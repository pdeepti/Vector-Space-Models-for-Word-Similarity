program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent . "
serbian , montenegrin , bosnian and croatian intelligence officials had met in belgrade to prepare his capture , dnevni avaz reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic -lrb- left -rrb- and karadzic in 1993 , during the bosnian war the next day , serbia 's top security officials - the director of the national security and intelligence agency , a war crimes prosecutor 's spokesman and the national police chief - denied claims that mladic was located and all but arrested . for mladic , 66 , arrest would mean facing united nations war crimes charges , including genocide , notably for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys at srebrenica in 1995 . the mood of anticipation was fomented by the july arrest of mladic 's political supremo , bosnian serb war-time leader radovan karadzic - seen as a sign of resolve by serbia 's new government to overcome the war crimes issue . but it is unclear whether the arrest of karadzic was the result of a serious operation or a fluke .
he had changed his appearance but lived openly in belgrade as a doctor-healer , wrote books , went to restaurants and took synthesizer classes . military had sheltered mladic mladic , seen by much of the world as a mastermind of serb ethnic cleansing , moved around freely in belgrade after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 . he went underground after milosevic fell in october 2000 , but remained under the military 's wing for at least several more years . in early 2006 , after denying it for more than five years , belgrade admitted that the military " had undeniably on occasion sheltered " mladic until 2002 at " army facilities " and that retired army officers were still assisting him . today it is unclear whether mladic is protected by fierce , heavily armed supporters ready to kill , as some reports claim , whether he is alone , perhaps shepherding sheep , as others say , or if he is living a life as bizarre as that of karadzic . officials ' involvement unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the 1995 massacre in srebrenica before karadzic 's arrest , even serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic apparently was duped . " mladic is in serbia , but karadzic is somewhere in the region , " he said six months before the latter was caught on a public bus in belgrade , the serbian capital . dozens of serb officials , including those who should know all that the secret services know about the war crime fugitive , have made similar statements over the years . so they either did not know or , as the serbian euphemism goes , they " told the untruth . " mladic 's pension still paid mladic is accused of a string of war crimes during his time as serb military commander in the 1992-95 bosnian war , including the sniping and shelling of sarajevo during the 43-month serb siege of the city . but many serbs , particularly those from bosnia , see him as the hero who protected them in the war . what seems clear is that serbia 's army is still paying mladic 's pension into his bank account , although it 's out of reach because the government finally blocked assets of war crime suspects on jan .
1 , 2006 . until then , mladic 's family had been allowed to withdraw a pension .
since then , close to 2 million dinars -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- , or 80 average serbian wages , has accumulated in the general 's account , the press daily reported tuesday . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . similarly , left party chief gregor gysi warned that germany was threatening to " sink into the mire of a dirty war " which was n't fighting terror but only leading to more violence . there 's only one solution , he said in the saturday edition of the frankfurter rundschau : " germany has to pull the bundeswehr out of afghanistan . " alternatively , the secretary general of the free democratic party , dirk niebel , called for greater emphasis on germany 's police training mission in the country , so that the afghan people would ultimately be in a position to maintain public security and order . over 60 german police officers are currently stationed in afghanistan . three dead , four injured afghan police had confirmed on friday that a woman and two children were killed when german soldiers opened fire on a civilian vehicle in the northern province of kunduz .
four other children injured . the incident - which occurred south-east of the provincial capital city , also called kunduz - took place thursday evening in a region where german troops lead operations for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said in berlin . two civilian vehicles approaching the checkpoint failed to heed clear signals from the troops manning the checkpoint and the security forces then opened fire , said raabe . signals went unheeded " when the vehicle did not stop after several signals , the german forces opened fire at the car , " said abdul rahman aqtash , security chief of the provincial police department , " when the forces later checked the vehicle , they found two children and a woman dead and four other children wounded in the vehicle . " german , afghan national army and afghan police forces installed the checkpoint in the area after receiving information that a vehicle would smuggle drugs into neighboring takhar province , he said . " first , a vehicle approached the checkpoint but escaped when the forces tried to stop it , " aqtash said .
" the forces opened fire at the second vehicle , which was driving behind the first one and did not heed repeated signals by the forces . " more than 3,500 german soldiers are serving in the isaf and are mostly stationed in northern provinces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent . "
serbian , montenegrin , bosnian and croatian intelligence officials had met in belgrade to prepare his capture , dnevni avaz reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic -lrb- left -rrb- and karadzic in 1993 , during the bosnian war the next day , serbia 's top security officials - the director of the national security and intelligence agency , a war crimes prosecutor 's spokesman and the national police chief - denied claims that mladic was located and all but arrested . for mladic , 66 , arrest would mean facing united nations war crimes charges , including genocide , notably for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys at srebrenica in 1995 . the mood of anticipation was fomented by the july arrest of mladic 's political supremo , bosnian serb war-time leader radovan karadzic - seen as a sign of resolve by serbia 's new government to overcome the war crimes issue . but it is unclear whether the arrest of karadzic was the result of a serious operation or a fluke .
he had changed his appearance but lived openly in belgrade as a doctor-healer , wrote books , went to restaurants and took synthesizer classes . military had sheltered mladic mladic , seen by much of the world as a mastermind of serb ethnic cleansing , moved around freely in belgrade after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 . he went underground after milosevic fell in october 2000 , but remained under the military 's wing for at least several more years . in early 2006 , after denying it for more than five years , belgrade admitted that the military " had undeniably on occasion sheltered " mladic until 2002 at " army facilities " and that retired army officers were still assisting him . today it is unclear whether mladic is protected by fierce , heavily armed supporters ready to kill , as some reports claim , whether he is alone , perhaps shepherding sheep , as others say , or if he is living a life as bizarre as that of karadzic . officials ' involvement unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the 1995 massacre in srebrenica before karadzic 's arrest , even serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic apparently was duped . " mladic is in serbia , but karadzic is somewhere in the region , " he said six months before the latter was caught on a public bus in belgrade , the serbian capital . dozens of serb officials , including those who should know all that the secret services know about the war crime fugitive , have made similar statements over the years . so they either did not know or , as the serbian euphemism goes , they " told the untruth . " mladic 's pension still paid mladic is accused of a string of war crimes during his time as serb military commander in the 1992-95 bosnian war , including the sniping and shelling of sarajevo during the 43-month serb siege of the city . but many serbs , particularly those from bosnia , see him as the hero who protected them in the war . what seems clear is that serbia 's army is still paying mladic 's pension into his bank account , although it 's out of reach because the government finally blocked assets of war crime suspects on jan .
1 , 2006 . until then , mladic 's family had been allowed to withdraw a pension .
since then , close to 2 million dinars -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- , or 80 average serbian wages , has accumulated in the general 's account , the press daily reported tuesday . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

brazil went on to win 3-0 in dortmund . hill , whose book on match-fixing will be published in germany on tuesday , said three years of research had shown that a former ghana international had acted as the middleman between ghana 's players and the head of a betting syndicate in bangkok . the german publication said its own research had shown two matches in germany to be suspicious after huge sums were placed on them by a malaysian who has been convicted of attempted match-fixing . bundesliga suspicions according to the report , william bee wah lim placed 2.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- with asian bookmakers on kaiserslautern losing a first-division match at hanover on nov .

30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .

30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .

" i personally consider this problem will only be solved through dialogue and negotiation . " otegi also said that during the process " all basque political prisoners must be freed . " while serving his sentence ortegi reportedly kept a low profile , spending his time learning english and only having rare visits from political figures .
asked what he had planned for the future , he said only , " we 'll see . " he was imprisoned following a failed appeal against charges of glorifying terrorism in a speech praising a member of eta , the basque separatist group .
otegi 's detention in june 2007 came days after eta called off a ceasefire with the spanish government .
he is believed to have been a key figure in the resumption of violent attacks against the spanish state . batsuna has been banned since 2003 for refusing to formally sever links with eta , which has waged a 40-year terror campaign for basque independence in which 823 people have died . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .

" there is an unresolved problem in this country , " otegi told reporters .
" i personally consider this problem will only be solved through dialogue and negotiation . " otegi also said that during the process " all basque political prisoners must be freed . " while serving his sentence ortegi reportedly kept a low profile , spending his time learning english and only having rare visits from political figures .
asked what he had planned for the future , he said only , " we 'll see . " he was imprisoned following a failed appeal against charges of glorifying terrorism in a speech praising a member of eta , the basque separatist group .

1 , edition of der spiegel newsmagazine , the canadian journalist declan hill said his research had shown that an asian syndicate wanted ghana to lose the quarter-final match by at least two goals .
brazil went on to win 3-0 in dortmund . hill , whose book on match-fixing will be published in germany on tuesday , said three years of research had shown that a former ghana international had acted as the middleman between ghana 's players and the head of a betting syndicate in bangkok . the german publication said its own research had shown two matches in germany to be suspicious after huge sums were placed on them by a malaysian who has been convicted of attempted match-fixing . bundesliga suspicions according to the report , william bee wah lim placed 2.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- with asian bookmakers on kaiserslautern losing a first-division match at hanover on nov .

karlsruhe won the game 2-0 . the report said investigations had produced evidence that lim had contacts with players from kaiserslautern , karlsruhe and sportfreunde siegen , although the players have protested . lim was sentenced to a jail term of two years and five months a court in frankfurt in june 2007 after being convicted of attempted fixing of matches in the german regional league -lrb- then third division -rrb- and the austrian first division .

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent . "
serbian , montenegrin , bosnian and croatian intelligence officials had met in belgrade to prepare his capture , dnevni avaz reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic -lrb- left -rrb- and karadzic in 1993 , during the bosnian war the next day , serbia 's top security officials - the director of the national security and intelligence agency , a war crimes prosecutor 's spokesman and the national police chief - denied claims that mladic was located and all but arrested . for mladic , 66 , arrest would mean facing united nations war crimes charges , including genocide , notably for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys at srebrenica in 1995 . the mood of anticipation was fomented by the july arrest of mladic 's political supremo , bosnian serb war-time leader radovan karadzic - seen as a sign of resolve by serbia 's new government to overcome the war crimes issue . but it is unclear whether the arrest of karadzic was the result of a serious operation or a fluke .
he had changed his appearance but lived openly in belgrade as a doctor-healer , wrote books , went to restaurants and took synthesizer classes . military had sheltered mladic mladic , seen by much of the world as a mastermind of serb ethnic cleansing , moved around freely in belgrade after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 . he went underground after milosevic fell in october 2000 , but remained under the military 's wing for at least several more years . in early 2006 , after denying it for more than five years , belgrade admitted that the military " had undeniably on occasion sheltered " mladic until 2002 at " army facilities " and that retired army officers were still assisting him . today it is unclear whether mladic is protected by fierce , heavily armed supporters ready to kill , as some reports claim , whether he is alone , perhaps shepherding sheep , as others say , or if he is living a life as bizarre as that of karadzic . officials ' involvement unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the 1995 massacre in srebrenica before karadzic 's arrest , even serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic apparently was duped . " mladic is in serbia , but karadzic is somewhere in the region , " he said six months before the latter was caught on a public bus in belgrade , the serbian capital . dozens of serb officials , including those who should know all that the secret services know about the war crime fugitive , have made similar statements over the years . so they either did not know or , as the serbian euphemism goes , they " told the untruth . " mladic 's pension still paid mladic is accused of a string of war crimes during his time as serb military commander in the 1992-95 bosnian war , including the sniping and shelling of sarajevo during the 43-month serb siege of the city . but many serbs , particularly those from bosnia , see him as the hero who protected them in the war . what seems clear is that serbia 's army is still paying mladic 's pension into his bank account , although it 's out of reach because the government finally blocked assets of war crime suspects on jan .
1 , 2006 . until then , mladic 's family had been allowed to withdraw a pension .
since then , close to 2 million dinars -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- , or 80 average serbian wages , has accumulated in the general 's account , the press daily reported tuesday . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent . "
serbian , montenegrin , bosnian and croatian intelligence officials had met in belgrade to prepare his capture , dnevni avaz reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic -lrb- left -rrb- and karadzic in 1993 , during the bosnian war the next day , serbia 's top security officials - the director of the national security and intelligence agency , a war crimes prosecutor 's spokesman and the national police chief - denied claims that mladic was located and all but arrested . for mladic , 66 , arrest would mean facing united nations war crimes charges , including genocide , notably for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys at srebrenica in 1995 . the mood of anticipation was fomented by the july arrest of mladic 's political supremo , bosnian serb war-time leader radovan karadzic - seen as a sign of resolve by serbia 's new government to overcome the war crimes issue . but it is unclear whether the arrest of karadzic was the result of a serious operation or a fluke .
he had changed his appearance but lived openly in belgrade as a doctor-healer , wrote books , went to restaurants and took synthesizer classes . military had sheltered mladic mladic , seen by much of the world as a mastermind of serb ethnic cleansing , moved around freely in belgrade after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 . he went underground after milosevic fell in october 2000 , but remained under the military 's wing for at least several more years . in early 2006 , after denying it for more than five years , belgrade admitted that the military " had undeniably on occasion sheltered " mladic until 2002 at " army facilities " and that retired army officers were still assisting him . today it is unclear whether mladic is protected by fierce , heavily armed supporters ready to kill , as some reports claim , whether he is alone , perhaps shepherding sheep , as others say , or if he is living a life as bizarre as that of karadzic . officials ' involvement unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the 1995 massacre in srebrenica before karadzic 's arrest , even serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic apparently was duped . " mladic is in serbia , but karadzic is somewhere in the region , " he said six months before the latter was caught on a public bus in belgrade , the serbian capital . dozens of serb officials , including those who should know all that the secret services know about the war crime fugitive , have made similar statements over the years . so they either did not know or , as the serbian euphemism goes , they " told the untruth . " mladic 's pension still paid mladic is accused of a string of war crimes during his time as serb military commander in the 1992-95 bosnian war , including the sniping and shelling of sarajevo during the 43-month serb siege of the city . but many serbs , particularly those from bosnia , see him as the hero who protected them in the war . what seems clear is that serbia 's army is still paying mladic 's pension into his bank account , although it 's out of reach because the government finally blocked assets of war crime suspects on jan .
1 , 2006 . until then , mladic 's family had been allowed to withdraw a pension .
since then , close to 2 million dinars -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- , or 80 average serbian wages , has accumulated in the general 's account , the press daily reported tuesday . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . this would enable a direct connection to the uzbekistan rail network and to the uzbek city of termez , where the german air force has its main local logistics site for incoming supplies from germany . germany has an agreement with russia permitting it to transport supplies via rail through russia to afghanistan .
the new link would make resupplying germany 's base in mazar-i-sharif , its largest in afghanistan , less of a logistic challenge . the newsmagazine said the military hoped that the german aid ministry and international organizations would contribute to the cost of building the line , since the link would also boost the economy of the region . no costing estimates for the project had been made yet . the idea for the railway route dated back to soviet times , when engineers proposed a 200-kilometer line from hairatan via mazar to pul-i-khumri , but this was never built . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?

30 . this would enable a direct connection to the uzbekistan rail network and to the uzbek city of termez , where the german air force has its main local logistics site for incoming supplies from germany . germany has an agreement with russia permitting it to transport supplies via rail through russia to afghanistan .
the new link would make resupplying germany 's base in mazar-i-sharif , its largest in afghanistan , less of a logistic challenge . the newsmagazine said the military hoped that the german aid ministry and international organizations would contribute to the cost of building the line , since the link would also boost the economy of the region . no costing estimates for the project had been made yet . the idea for the railway route dated back to soviet times , when engineers proposed a 200-kilometer line from hairatan via mazar to pul-i-khumri , but this was never built . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent . "
serbian , montenegrin , bosnian and croatian intelligence officials had met in belgrade to prepare his capture , dnevni avaz reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic -lrb- left -rrb- and karadzic in 1993 , during the bosnian war the next day , serbia 's top security officials - the director of the national security and intelligence agency , a war crimes prosecutor 's spokesman and the national police chief - denied claims that mladic was located and all but arrested . for mladic , 66 , arrest would mean facing united nations war crimes charges , including genocide , notably for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys at srebrenica in 1995 . the mood of anticipation was fomented by the july arrest of mladic 's political supremo , bosnian serb war-time leader radovan karadzic - seen as a sign of resolve by serbia 's new government to overcome the war crimes issue . but it is unclear whether the arrest of karadzic was the result of a serious operation or a fluke .
he had changed his appearance but lived openly in belgrade as a doctor-healer , wrote books , went to restaurants and took synthesizer classes . military had sheltered mladic mladic , seen by much of the world as a mastermind of serb ethnic cleansing , moved around freely in belgrade after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 . he went underground after milosevic fell in october 2000 , but remained under the military 's wing for at least several more years . in early 2006 , after denying it for more than five years , belgrade admitted that the military " had undeniably on occasion sheltered " mladic until 2002 at " army facilities " and that retired army officers were still assisting him . today it is unclear whether mladic is protected by fierce , heavily armed supporters ready to kill , as some reports claim , whether he is alone , perhaps shepherding sheep , as others say , or if he is living a life as bizarre as that of karadzic . officials ' involvement unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the 1995 massacre in srebrenica before karadzic 's arrest , even serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic apparently was duped . " mladic is in serbia , but karadzic is somewhere in the region , " he said six months before the latter was caught on a public bus in belgrade , the serbian capital . dozens of serb officials , including those who should know all that the secret services know about the war crime fugitive , have made similar statements over the years . so they either did not know or , as the serbian euphemism goes , they " told the untruth . " mladic 's pension still paid mladic is accused of a string of war crimes during his time as serb military commander in the 1992-95 bosnian war , including the sniping and shelling of sarajevo during the 43-month serb siege of the city . but many serbs , particularly those from bosnia , see him as the hero who protected them in the war . what seems clear is that serbia 's army is still paying mladic 's pension into his bank account , although it 's out of reach because the government finally blocked assets of war crime suspects on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .
russia claims it is within its rights under a cease-fire agreement to keep peacekeepers in a buffer zone outside the rebel areas .

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .
russia claims it is within its rights under a cease-fire agreement to keep peacekeepers in a buffer zone outside the rebel areas .
as the country which brokered the deal and currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , france disputes that point . georgian reintegration minister temur yakobashvili said he hoped the eu would punish russia with targeted sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will work to ease tensions at monday 's meeting " there is no point in isolating russia , " the minister told the afp news agency .
" but we expect certain sanctions , which wo n't be against the people , but against the political elite . " russia and germany , however , agreed on saturday to seek to calm tensions in europe over the conflict in georgia , the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier " agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia ... to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non-existent threats concerning other post-soviet countries , " the statement said . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry confirmed a telephone call between the two ministers took place but would not comment on the conversation 's details . eu 's punitive options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the sochi olympics become a casualty of the caucasus war ?
eu diplomats also expressed worries that russia might use its control over oil supplies as a political tool , such as in the past when it once cut off the flow of oil to the ukraine in a pricing dispute . punitive measures stopping short of broad sanctions against russian leaders could include travel bans or the freezing of overseas bank accounts . czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he supported calls for stripping moscow of the right to host the 2014 winter olympics in the black sea resort of sochi , in an interview published saturday . " organizing a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea , " schwarzenberg told the austrian die presse newspaper . moscow 's ambassador to the eu vladimir chizhov , however , urged against sanctions friday . " i wo n't bet on it , but , at least , i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia , " chizhov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in brussels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brazil went on to win 3-0 in dortmund . hill , whose book on match-fixing will be published in germany on tuesday , said three years of research had shown that a former ghana international had acted as the middleman between ghana 's players and the head of a betting syndicate in bangkok . the german publication said its own research had shown two matches in germany to be suspicious after huge sums were placed on them by a malaysian who has been convicted of attempted match-fixing . bundesliga suspicions according to the report , william bee wah lim placed 2.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- with asian bookmakers on kaiserslautern losing a first-division match at hanover on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .

academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .

in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .

it is necessary to do everything to stop this escalation , or soon the soon black sea will overflow its shores with foreign warships , " gorbachev was quoted by news agency interfax as saying . " there is no need to simplify the conflict , " gorbachev added .
" it is serious , difficult - but it 's as important as ever to think about how to live in europe , how to build a united europe .

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent .

the new link would make resupplying germany 's base in mazar-i-sharif , its largest in afghanistan , less of a logistic challenge . the newsmagazine said the military hoped that the german aid ministry and international organizations would contribute to the cost of building the line , since the link would also boost the economy of the region . no costing estimates for the project had been made yet . the idea for the railway route dated back to soviet times , when engineers proposed a 200-kilometer line from hairatan via mazar to pul-i-khumri , but this was never built . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .
russia claims it is within its rights under a cease-fire agreement to keep peacekeepers in a buffer zone outside the rebel areas .
as the country which brokered the deal and currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , france disputes that point . georgian reintegration minister temur yakobashvili said he hoped the eu would punish russia with targeted sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will work to ease tensions at monday 's meeting " there is no point in isolating russia , " the minister told the afp news agency .
" but we expect certain sanctions , which wo n't be against the people , but against the political elite . " russia and germany , however , agreed on saturday to seek to calm tensions in europe over the conflict in georgia , the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier " agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia ... to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non-existent threats concerning other post-soviet countries , " the statement said . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry confirmed a telephone call between the two ministers took place but would not comment on the conversation 's details . eu 's punitive options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the sochi olympics become a casualty of the caucasus war ?
eu diplomats also expressed worries that russia might use its control over oil supplies as a political tool , such as in the past when it once cut off the flow of oil to the ukraine in a pricing dispute . punitive measures stopping short of broad sanctions against russian leaders could include travel bans or the freezing of overseas bank accounts . czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he supported calls for stripping moscow of the right to host the 2014 winter olympics in the black sea resort of sochi , in an interview published saturday . " organizing a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea , " schwarzenberg told the austrian die presse newspaper . moscow 's ambassador to the eu vladimir chizhov , however , urged against sanctions friday . " i wo n't bet on it , but , at least , i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia , " chizhov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in brussels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de putin calls on eu to be " reasonable " and avoid sanctions russian prime minister vladimir putin has called for the european union to take a " reasonable attitude " in the caucasus conflict at an eu summit next week and not impose sanctions .

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .
russia claims it is within its rights under a cease-fire agreement to keep peacekeepers in a buffer zone outside the rebel areas .
as the country which brokered the deal and currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , france disputes that point . georgian reintegration minister temur yakobashvili said he hoped the eu would punish russia with targeted sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will work to ease tensions at monday 's meeting " there is no point in isolating russia , " the minister told the afp news agency .
" but we expect certain sanctions , which wo n't be against the people , but against the political elite . " russia and germany , however , agreed on saturday to seek to calm tensions in europe over the conflict in georgia , the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier " agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia ... to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non-existent threats concerning other post-soviet countries , " the statement said . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry confirmed a telephone call between the two ministers took place but would not comment on the conversation 's details . eu 's punitive options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the sochi olympics become a casualty of the caucasus war ?
eu diplomats also expressed worries that russia might use its control over oil supplies as a political tool , such as in the past when it once cut off the flow of oil to the ukraine in a pricing dispute . punitive measures stopping short of broad sanctions against russian leaders could include travel bans or the freezing of overseas bank accounts . czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he supported calls for stripping moscow of the right to host the 2014 winter olympics in the black sea resort of sochi , in an interview published saturday . " organizing a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea , " schwarzenberg told the austrian die presse newspaper . moscow 's ambassador to the eu vladimir chizhov , however , urged against sanctions friday . " i wo n't bet on it , but , at least , i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia , " chizhov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in brussels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .
russia claims it is within its rights under a cease-fire agreement to keep peacekeepers in a buffer zone outside the rebel areas .
as the country which brokered the deal and currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , france disputes that point . georgian reintegration minister temur yakobashvili said he hoped the eu would punish russia with targeted sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will work to ease tensions at monday 's meeting " there is no point in isolating russia , " the minister told the afp news agency .
" but we expect certain sanctions , which wo n't be against the people , but against the political elite . " russia and germany , however , agreed on saturday to seek to calm tensions in europe over the conflict in georgia , the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier " agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia ... to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non-existent threats concerning other post-soviet countries , " the statement said . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry confirmed a telephone call between the two ministers took place but would not comment on the conversation 's details . eu 's punitive options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the sochi olympics become a casualty of the caucasus war ?

30 . this would enable a direct connection to the uzbekistan rail network and to the uzbek city of termez , where the german air force has its main local logistics site for incoming supplies from germany . germany has an agreement with russia permitting it to transport supplies via rail through russia to afghanistan .
the new link would make resupplying germany 's base in mazar-i-sharif , its largest in afghanistan , less of a logistic challenge . the newsmagazine said the military hoped that the german aid ministry and international organizations would contribute to the cost of building the line , since the link would also boost the economy of the region . no costing estimates for the project had been made yet . the idea for the railway route dated back to soviet times , when engineers proposed a 200-kilometer line from hairatan via mazar to pul-i-khumri , but this was never built . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

1 , edition of der spiegel newsmagazine , the canadian journalist declan hill said his research had shown that an asian syndicate wanted ghana to lose the quarter-final match by at least two goals .
brazil went on to win 3-0 in dortmund . hill , whose book on match-fixing will be published in germany on tuesday , said three years of research had shown that a former ghana international had acted as the middleman between ghana 's players and the head of a betting syndicate in bangkok . the german publication said its own research had shown two matches in germany to be suspicious after huge sums were placed on them by a malaysian who has been convicted of attempted match-fixing . bundesliga suspicions according to the report , william bee wah lim placed 2.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- with asian bookmakers on kaiserslautern losing a first-division match at hanover on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .

"
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .

belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?

30 . this would enable a direct connection to the uzbekistan rail network and to the uzbek city of termez , where the german air force has its main local logistics site for incoming supplies from germany . germany has an agreement with russia permitting it to transport supplies via rail through russia to afghanistan .
the new link would make resupplying germany 's base in mazar-i-sharif , its largest in afghanistan , less of a logistic challenge . the newsmagazine said the military hoped that the german aid ministry and international organizations would contribute to the cost of building the line , since the link would also boost the economy of the region . no costing estimates for the project had been made yet . the idea for the railway route dated back to soviet times , when engineers proposed a 200-kilometer line from hairatan via mazar to pul-i-khumri , but this was never built . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is an unresolved problem in this country , " otegi told reporters .
" i personally consider this problem will only be solved through dialogue and negotiation . " otegi also said that during the process " all basque political prisoners must be freed . " while serving his sentence ortegi reportedly kept a low profile , spending his time learning english and only having rare visits from political figures .
asked what he had planned for the future , he said only , " we 'll see . " he was imprisoned following a failed appeal against charges of glorifying terrorism in a speech praising a member of eta , the basque separatist group .
otegi 's detention in june 2007 came days after eta called off a ceasefire with the spanish government .
he is believed to have been a key figure in the resumption of violent attacks against the spanish state . batsuna has been banned since 2003 for refusing to formally sever links with eta , which has waged a 40-year terror campaign for basque independence in which 823 people have died . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of police kept a careful eye on the rally after some demonstrators had threatened to climb the fence and enter the fighter-bomber base . " i never would have thought that germany would again threaten the world by stationing us nuclear weapons here , " said horst-eberhard richter , a member of germany 's pacifist movement . neither german nor us officials have ever confirmed that the sole remaining us nuclear warheads on german soil are maintained at buechel by a us air force team .
experts , however , say that this is plausible since us nuclear-weapon safety inspectors do make calls at the site . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and moscow aim to calm tensions in the caucasus region . medvedev told brown that russia welcomed the deployment of organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in the conflict regions of georgia , interfax news agency reported on saturday , aug .
30 . the russian president also requested the osce send more observers to georgia , according to a statement released by the kremlin . moscow " calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government , " it said . the 56-nation osce decided this month to send up to 100 observers , including up to 15 from germany , to georgia .
at least 10 countries have offered to contribute .
there were eight osce unarmed military observers in georgia before the conflict broke out , serving in a mission set up in 1992 . georgian aggression ? german news weekly der spiegel separately reported that osce observers were blaming georgia for triggering the crisis in a series of unofficial reports to the german government . osce monitors said georgia had made extensive preparations for the offensive in south ossetia in early august .
tbilisi has claimed that they were provoked by the russian side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has said moscow was the aggressor in the caucasus crisis medvedev also renewed russian accusations that the georgian leadership under president mikhail saakashvili was responsible for the southern caucasus conflict . it was " aggression " from tbilisi towards its separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia that had made it impossible for these regions to live in peace within georgia , medvedev said . georgian media reports meanwhile quoted saakashvili as saying tbilisi was to introduce tougher laws to stop georgia being " destabilized " following the recent invasion by russian troops . saakashvili was speaking late friday during a visit to the black sea town of poti where there was still a russian troop presence , the reports said .
saakashvili gave no details of what measures were being introduced , but had stressed that " citizens ' rights " would not be affected . saakashvili again accused russia of having planned to overthrow the tbilisi leadership by force - a claim repeatedly denied by moscow , most recently by russian prime minister vladimir putin on friday . he told german public broadcaster ard television the georgian claim was " an outright lie " and said he believed saakashvili should step down . checkpoints block homebound refugees putin said russia intended to withdraw its soldiers from the buffer zone they had take over in uncontested georgian territory as soon as the crisis de-escalates . but a return to stability was being hindered by russian troops inside georgian territory were stopping thousands of refugees from returning to their homes , a georgian official told reuters news agency on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian checkpoints make it difficult for refugees to return home russian troops were still manning checkpoints in georgia and patrolling a black sea port even after moscow pulled back much of the force it deployed to crush georgia 's attempt to take back two separatist provinces . " the russians have checkpoints and we still can not bring these people back home .
the threat of paramilitary , irregulars , looting and robbing is still very high , " governor lado vardzelashvili said .
" apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases . " the positioning of russian troops inside south ossetia and abkhazia are likely to be on the agenda when european officials meet monday in brussels in an effort to curb escalating tensions in the caucasus region . berlin , moscow to calm situation sanctions are also among measure set to be discussed by eu leaders furious over moscow 's slow withdrawal of troops from georgia .
russia claims it is within its rights under a cease-fire agreement to keep peacekeepers in a buffer zone outside the rebel areas .
as the country which brokered the deal and currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , france disputes that point . georgian reintegration minister temur yakobashvili said he hoped the eu would punish russia with targeted sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will work to ease tensions at monday 's meeting " there is no point in isolating russia , " the minister told the afp news agency .
" but we expect certain sanctions , which wo n't be against the people , but against the political elite . " russia and germany , however , agreed on saturday to seek to calm tensions in europe over the conflict in georgia , the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier " agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia ... to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non-existent threats concerning other post-soviet countries , " the statement said . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry confirmed a telephone call between the two ministers took place but would not comment on the conversation 's details . eu 's punitive options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the sochi olympics become a casualty of the caucasus war ?
eu diplomats also expressed worries that russia might use its control over oil supplies as a political tool , such as in the past when it once cut off the flow of oil to the ukraine in a pricing dispute . punitive measures stopping short of broad sanctions against russian leaders could include travel bans or the freezing of overseas bank accounts . czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he supported calls for stripping moscow of the right to host the 2014 winter olympics in the black sea resort of sochi , in an interview published saturday . " organizing a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea , " schwarzenberg told the austrian die presse newspaper . moscow 's ambassador to the eu vladimir chizhov , however , urged against sanctions friday . " i wo n't bet on it , but , at least , i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia , " chizhov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in brussels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly 13 years after the bosnian war ended , ratko mladic 's run from justice is tarnishing serbia 's image , hindering closer ties with the european union and giving rise to yet another round of speculation . into serbia 's summer doldrums came the news : ratko mladic , bosnian serb genocide suspect and one of the world 's most wanted men , was about to be arrested . then again , he was n't . mladic is in serbia .
mladic is not in serbia .
mladic in russia .
mladic negotiates surrender .
mladic would rather kill himself than surrender . such contradictory headlines have been the norm since the former bosnian serb military chief 's protector , slobodan milosevic , fell as serbia 's ruler in 2000 . another false alarm earlier this week , a bosnian newspaper quoted security sources as saying mladic 's arrest was " imminent . "
serbian , montenegrin , bosnian and croatian intelligence officials had met in belgrade to prepare his capture , dnevni avaz reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic -lrb- left -rrb- and karadzic in 1993 , during the bosnian war the next day , serbia 's top security officials - the director of the national security and intelligence agency , a war crimes prosecutor 's spokesman and the national police chief - denied claims that mladic was located and all but arrested . for mladic , 66 , arrest would mean facing united nations war crimes charges , including genocide , notably for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys at srebrenica in 1995 . the mood of anticipation was fomented by the july arrest of mladic 's political supremo , bosnian serb war-time leader radovan karadzic - seen as a sign of resolve by serbia 's new government to overcome the war crimes issue . but it is unclear whether the arrest of karadzic was the result of a serious operation or a fluke .
he had changed his appearance but lived openly in belgrade as a doctor-healer , wrote books , went to restaurants and took synthesizer classes . military had sheltered mladic mladic , seen by much of the world as a mastermind of serb ethnic cleansing , moved around freely in belgrade after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 . he went underground after milosevic fell in october 2000 , but remained under the military 's wing for at least several more years . in early 2006 , after denying it for more than five years , belgrade admitted that the military " had undeniably on occasion sheltered " mladic until 2002 at " army facilities " and that retired army officers were still assisting him . today it is unclear whether mladic is protected by fierce , heavily armed supporters ready to kill , as some reports claim , whether he is alone , perhaps shepherding sheep , as others say , or if he is living a life as bizarre as that of karadzic . officials ' involvement unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the 1995 massacre in srebrenica before karadzic 's arrest , even serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic apparently was duped . " mladic is in serbia , but karadzic is somewhere in the region , " he said six months before the latter was caught on a public bus in belgrade , the serbian capital . dozens of serb officials , including those who should know all that the secret services know about the war crime fugitive , have made similar statements over the years . so they either did not know or , as the serbian euphemism goes , they " told the untruth . " mladic 's pension still paid mladic is accused of a string of war crimes during his time as serb military commander in the 1992-95 bosnian war , including the sniping and shelling of sarajevo during the 43-month serb siege of the city . but many serbs , particularly those from bosnia , see him as the hero who protected them in the war . what seems clear is that serbia 's army is still paying mladic 's pension into his bank account , although it 's out of reach because the government finally blocked assets of war crime suspects on jan .
1 , 2006 . until then , mladic 's family had been allowed to withdraw a pension .
since then , close to 2 million dinars -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- , or 80 average serbian wages , has accumulated in the general 's account , the press daily reported tuesday . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon european union makes a meal of regional treats will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 30.08.2008 could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you heard the one about the bloc which tried to get 27 nations to work together ? "
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .

30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 30.08.2008 us judge : berlin plane hijack trial had parallels to guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one had ever been prosecuted for escaping ever since the wall went up in 1961 a us judge who presided over the 1978 berlin trial of an east german hijacker told dw-world.de that parallels with the current terror trials at guantanamo can be drawn . on aug .
30 , 1978 hans detlef tiede boarded flight lot 165 in the polish city gdansk and used a toy pistol to divert the east berlin-bound jet to the american sector on the other side of the wall . the passenger plane made a safe landing at the us military air base tempelhof , and nine other east germans aboard took the chance of defecting to allied occupied west berlin , including tiede 's accomplice ingrid ruske and her young daughter . only tiede and ruske could not walk free in berlin 's american zone , since the act of hijacking a civilian airliner violated international conventions long negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact .
for the first and only time , a us court of justice was convened in berlin to prosecute the case .
herbert j. stern , the american judge who tried the case in a makeshift courthouse in the departure lounge of tempelhof airport , is currently a partner at his own law firm in new jersey and author of judgment in berlin . dw-world.de : two east germans want to escape a repressive regime .
they hijack a plane , which lands safely at one airport instead of another in the same city .
no one was killed or injured .
several passengers even walked free and those that remained on lot 165 were a bit inconvenienced .
so what 's the problem here ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stern -lrb- right -rrb- tried the case in berlin 's tempelhof airport herbert stern : all the countries involved - the us , poland , west germany and east germany were signatories to an international convention on air piracy .
this meant that whoever diverted a plane had to be either prosecuted -lrb- at the hijacked destination -rrb- or sent back to be prosecuted .
these accords had been instigated by the us , which was worried about air traffic being diverted to cuba in those days . the problem for the west germans was that they regarded all germans as citizens of the federal republic .
nobody had ever been prosecuted for escaping east germany ever since the wall went up in 1961 , even if they had roughed up or shot a guard . the west germans had never ever sent anyone back .
it would have also been politically suicidal for them to prosecute the case -lrb- against their own people -rrb- , so how do they get out of the mess ? well , berlin was occupied territory .
the west berliners were sovereign in the sense that they had a mayor , city government , parliament , judges and all that , but the allied occupation never ended -lrb- until unification -rrb- , because the west german government did n't want it to end .
if the allies had pulled out , it would have been the end of freedom for the 2 million people living in the western sector . the west germans were obliged by this air piracy agreement to prosecute the case , but could n't prosecute fellow germans from the east , so they were happy to let the americans take over . they insisted that the us take over , but there were no us courts in berlin .
the west germans begged the us to convene a tribunal for the first time and agreed to pay all courtroom expenses - the prosecutors , defense attorneys , the judge . the us state department was keen on prosecuting the case ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international conventions make air piracy a criminal act they were absolutely committed to prosecute , make no mistake about it .
the state department appointed me as us judge for berlin .
even the west german government wanted tiede and ruske convicted and so did the poles , because at that time it was viewed as an important case in protecting all civil aviation against air piracy .
so while it was possible to be sympathetic to the individual defendants , the integrity of air travel and air safety became foremost in the minds of the west . in east germany , they only wanted these defectors to be punished . you were at loggerheads with the us state department prosecutors , who got more than they bargained for when they appointed you as judge ... state took the position that they had the right to define what rights the defendants had , because tiede and ruske were neither us citizens nor on us territory , but stood before an occupational court , a conquerer 's court so to speak , the kind of court they have now instituted at guantanamo , where the same issues -lrb- concerning defendants ' rights -rrb- have percolated up . the state department took the position that i was not an independent judge as i would have been in the us .
i was their employee and i had to follow their instructions .
they were willing to grant some constitutional rights to the defendants , but not all , and they would pick which ones . so the us prosecutors did n't want to grant the east german defendants the constitutional right to a jury trial ... they did n't want that , since they thought a jury comprised of west berliners meant sure acquittal and would be a sham proceeding that would make the poles , the soviets and the east germans very unhappy . what they said was that the defendants had no rights at all except what the state department was willing to give them , and that is not a right . i told them that nobody in an american court , no matter where it sits , comes before a court with no rights ... that is just absurd .
i told them if they did n't bring in a jury and give these defendants their rights that i would throw the whole case out and turn them free .
that 's why we had a good old fashioned jury trial in the us sector of berlin . you seem very sympathetic to the defendants here , do n't you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trials of guantanamo inmates have begun i tell you , once i ruled that the american prosecutors had to bring german jurors into the room as the us constitution requires , they tried to force the defendants to plead guilty .
the case against the woman , ruske , was later dismissed by the prosecutors for lack of evidence .
then i found out in tiede 's case they said : " if you plead guilty , we will guarantee you a certain sentence , " but he refused the deal , so we had a jury trial . in which the jury found tiede innocent on all counts except one - guilty of taking a hostage , so you sentenced him to nine months , which wound up being the time he had already served in detention . i 'll tell you why i handed down that sentence .
when the jury convicted this fellow -lrb- on that one count -rrb- , it became clear to me i was dealing with a situation in which the occupying power simply thought they had the right to do anything to anybody , so i was n't going to deliver the defendant to their hands . to answer your earlier question ... of course i felt sympathetic to the situation of defectors from east berlin .
but at the end of day , it 's not for me to decide questions of guilt or innocence .
that 's why i brought in a community of west berliners to make those decisions . i was n't in that courtroom doing the pitching or batting , but i certainly was going to call a ball a strike .
i just did my job -lrb- as defender of the us constitution -rrb- , that 's all . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the eu is not the first thing to come to mind when you think of something hilarious - unless ridiculous policy decisions make you giggle .
but as europeans , laughing at fellow members could suggest a real togetherness . a french mountaineer who met a group of belgian climbers in the pyrenees recently chose an unusual way of getting them to smile for a team photo .
" what do belgians write at the bottom of their swimming pools ?
' no smoking ' , " he quipped , and clicked the shutter as they laughed .
whatever european union supporters may say about the way the bloc has created a zone of peace and harmony across the continent , its citizens still like nothing better than making jokes about each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians laugh at their european neighbors thus belgians form the butt of a huge stock of jokes both in france and in the netherlands , where they are seen , according to need , as stupid , naive or obsessed with food and drink .
belgians , in return , tell jokes about tight-fisted dutch and arrogant french and germans .
" what 's the difference between god and a frenchman ?
god does n't think he 's french , " a typical joke runs .
a similar lack of neighborly affection also pervades the baltic states , where latvians and lithuanians portray estonians as slow .
" what is the definition of a waltz ?
it 's estonian hip hop , " a lithuanian joke says .
in england , famously , the irish are the target .
the butt of the joke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish actually had the last laugh " an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman are put in front of a firing squad .
the englishman shouts ' earthquake ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion , " one typical joke begins .
" the scotsman shouts ' flood ! ' , and jumps over the wall in the confusion .
the irishman shouts ' fire ! ' , " it concludes .
academics say that such jokes usually only target nations with which the teller is familiar .
many are relatively innocuous , such as the estonian joke about the neighboring finns : " two finns buy a bottle of vodka .
one says ' cheers ! '
the other looks at him and says , ' did you come here to talk or to drink ? " '
but other jokes have more of an edge to them .
in latvia , for example , where relations between the latvian majority and the large russian minority can be openly hostile , jokes can be cruel .
" an american , a russian and a latvian are sitting in a train .
the american takes one puff on a cigarette , throws it out of the window and boasts , ' where i come from , we 've got so many of those we can just chuck them away . '
the russian takes one swig from a vodka bottle , throws it out of the window and says the same thing .
" the latvian thinks for a minute , then throws the russian out of the window , " the joke ends .
love thy neighbor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " is it too late to say we were austria fans ? "
and in austria , despite its cultural and economic closeness to germany , the jokes about germans can be anything but affectionate .
" a german boy goes to vienna for euro 2008 with his family and decides he wants to support austria .
when he says so , his sister slaps him , his mother spanks him and his father punches him .
" ' now , have you learned your lesson ? ' the father asks .
" ' yes , dad .
i 've only been an austria fan for an hour and already i hate the germans , ' the boy replies . "
but if such jokes make uneasy reading for eu leaders , there is still hope .
after all , if humor is based on insulting people who are familiar with each other , what could be a better sign of european integration than this jest , which has its equivalents in many eu languages ?
" in heaven , they have french cooks , english policemen , german mechanics , italian lovers and swiss bankers .

the results come from astronomical observations of a titanic collision between two clusters of galaxies 5.7 billion light-years away .
astronomers detected the dark matter because it separated from the normal matter during the cosmic smash-up .
the research team are to publish their findings in the astrophysical journal .
they used the hubble and chandra space telescopes to study the object macsj0025.4-1222 - formed after an incredibly energetic collision between two large galaxy clusters .
each of these large clusters contains about a quadrillion times the mass of our sun .
it puts to rest all the worries that the bullet cluster was an anomalous case .
we have gone out and found another one richard massey , royal observatory edinburgh a technique known as gravitational lensing was used to map the dark matter with hubble .
if an observer looks at a distant galaxy and some dark matter lies in between , the light from that galaxy gets distorted .
it looks as if it is being seen through lots of little lenses .
and each of these lenses represents a piece of dark matter .
astronomers used the chandra x-ray telescope to map ordinary matter in the merging clusters , mostly in the form of hot gas , which glows brightly in x-rays .
as the two clusters that formed macsj0025 merged at speeds of millions of kilometres per hour , hot gas in the two clusters collided and slowed down .
however , the dark matter kept on going , passing right through the smash-up .
speeding bullet this phenomenon has been seen before , in a structure called the bullet cluster - which also formed after the collision of two large galaxy clusters .
the bullet cluster lies closer to earth , at a distance of 3.4 billion light-years .
" it puts to rest all the worries that the bullet cluster was an anomalous case .
we have gone out and found another one , " co-author richard massey , from the royal observatory edinburgh , told bbc news .
the study sheds light on the properties of dark matter .
the fact that dark matter does not slow down in the collision supports a view that dark matter particles interact with each other only very weakly or not at all -lrb- when one excludes their gravitational interaction -rrb- .
" dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter , " said co-author marusa bradac , from the university of california at santa barbara -lrb- ucsb -rrb- .
" this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter , unlike the matter that we are made of .
and we 're able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies . "
larger sample the latest astronomical observations suggest that dark matter makes up some 23 % of the universe .
ordinary matter - such as the galaxies , gas , stars and planets - makes up just 4 % .
the remaining 73 % is made up of another mysterious quantity ; dark energy , which is responsible for speeding up the expansion of the cosmos .
the large hadron collider may shed further light on dark matter according to one model , dark matter may be comprised of exotic sub-atomic " stuff " known as weakly interacting massive particles -lrb- wimps -rrb- .
others hold that the dark substance consists of everyday matter , rather than some elusive sub-atomic particle .
however , this ordinary matter , referred to as massive astrophysical compact halo objects -lrb- machos -rrb- , happens to radiate little or no light .
a powerful physics experiment , the large hadron collider , situated on the french-swiss border , could shed further light on this question after it begins operating later this year .
dr massey said his team had found other candidates for colliding clusters .
" ideally , we do n't want just one or two , we want lots of these things to really study them statistically , " he explained .
" then we either use the whole lot , or pick out one ' golden bullet ' which will provide the best constraints on what dark matter is . "
the hubble space telescope failed just after the team had taken their image of macsj0025 , so they have not yet been able to study these other candidates .
dr massey said the astronomers hope to do this after the next hubble servicing mission with the space shuttle , which is due to launch in october 2008 .

the results come from astronomical observations of a titanic collision between two clusters of galaxies 5.7 billion light-years away .
astronomers detected the dark matter because it separated from the normal matter during the cosmic smash-up .
the research team are to publish their findings in the astrophysical journal .
they used the hubble and chandra space telescopes to study the object macsj0025.4-1222 - formed after an incredibly energetic collision between two large galaxy clusters .
each of these large clusters contains about a quadrillion times the mass of our sun .
it puts to rest all the worries that the bullet cluster was an anomalous case .
we have gone out and found another one richard massey , royal observatory edinburgh a technique known as gravitational lensing was used to map the dark matter with hubble .
if an observer looks at a distant galaxy and some dark matter lies in between , the light from that galaxy gets distorted .
it looks as if it is being seen through lots of little lenses .
and each of these lenses represents a piece of dark matter .
astronomers used the chandra x-ray telescope to map ordinary matter in the merging clusters , mostly in the form of hot gas , which glows brightly in x-rays .
as the two clusters that formed macsj0025 merged at speeds of millions of kilometres per hour , hot gas in the two clusters collided and slowed down .
however , the dark matter kept on going , passing right through the smash-up .
speeding bullet this phenomenon has been seen before , in a structure called the bullet cluster - which also formed after the collision of two large galaxy clusters .
the bullet cluster lies closer to earth , at a distance of 3.4 billion light-years .
" it puts to rest all the worries that the bullet cluster was an anomalous case .
we have gone out and found another one , " co-author richard massey , from the royal observatory edinburgh , told bbc news .
the study sheds light on the properties of dark matter .
the fact that dark matter does not slow down in the collision supports a view that dark matter particles interact with each other only very weakly or not at all -lrb- when one excludes their gravitational interaction -rrb- .
" dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter , " said co-author marusa bradac , from the university of california at santa barbara -lrb- ucsb -rrb- .
" this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter , unlike the matter that we are made of .
and we 're able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies . "
larger sample the latest astronomical observations suggest that dark matter makes up some 23 % of the universe .
ordinary matter - such as the galaxies , gas , stars and planets - makes up just 4 % .
the remaining 73 % is made up of another mysterious quantity ; dark energy , which is responsible for speeding up the expansion of the cosmos .
the large hadron collider may shed further light on dark matter according to one model , dark matter may be comprised of exotic sub-atomic " stuff " known as weakly interacting massive particles -lrb- wimps -rrb- .
others hold that the dark substance consists of everyday matter , rather than some elusive sub-atomic particle .
however , this ordinary matter , referred to as massive astrophysical compact halo objects -lrb- machos -rrb- , happens to radiate little or no light .
a powerful physics experiment , the large hadron collider , situated on the french-swiss border , could shed further light on this question after it begins operating later this year .
dr massey said his team had found other candidates for colliding clusters .
" ideally , we do n't want just one or two , we want lots of these things to really study them statistically , " he explained .
" then we either use the whole lot , or pick out one ' golden bullet ' which will provide the best constraints on what dark matter is . "
the hubble space telescope failed just after the team had taken their image of macsj0025 , so they have not yet been able to study these other candidates .
dr massey said the astronomers hope to do this after the next hubble servicing mission with the space shuttle , which is due to launch in october 2008 .

while an average welsh august has about 106mm of rain , figures show that up to 26 august there had been almost 180mm .
wales has been wetter than both england and scotland , and outstripped by only northern ireland , which has had over double its average rainfall .
the blame is partly put on the jet stream bringing weather systems across the atlantic being further south .
the unseasonal weather affected major events such as the national eisteddfod in cardiff on some days .

an annual harness racing festival in ceredigion was cancelled because of bad weather for the first time .
one of the world 's most eminent climatologists , sir john houghton , has said people must get used to intense rain and floods as global warming tightens its grip .
but not all of wales has been a washout in august with some areas , particularly parts of north-east wales , seeing close to average rainfall .
while august has been mostly grim , may was warmer and drier than normal and june was actually sunnier than average .
july , however , was much wetter than average , although levels of sunshine were only slightly below normal .

" the jet stream steers weather systems across the atlantic and normally it would go up between iceland and scotland bringing low pressure in that area , " he said .
" we would normally get high pressure from the azores but that has not really happened this year .
" this year the jet stream has been further south bringing low pressure and rain to wales . "
the wettest august on record was in 1917 , when 274.3mm of rain fell .
england has been drier than wales in august with 101.6mm , while scotland has seen 152.5mm.
ground conditions only northern ireland has had a wetter august with 195.1mm , which is more than double what it would usually expect for the whole month .
it has been a difficult month for businesses which depend on good weather .
clive bailey , of bailey balloons which operates hot air balloon flights , has seen a huge number of flights cancelled this month .
" we 've had to cancel flights because of ground conditions , " he said " we use llanarth village hall -lsb- in monmouthshire -rsb- , there 's a football pitch there we use as a launch site but the ground is too soft for land rovers .
" there 's also the continual poor weather .
" we would have done 30 or 40 flights in august usually and we 've done four , it 's been that bad . "
but some parts of wales have fared better than others , with flintshire seeing average rainfall for august .
higher areas have tended to get a lot of rain , such as parts of gwynedd and the south-east wales valleys , and parts of pembrokeshire and carmarthenshire have also had a soaking .
mr brockway pointed out , however , that august is usually the wettest summer month in wales anyway .

but not all of wales has been a washout in august with some areas , particularly parts of north-east wales , seeing close to average rainfall .
while august has been mostly grim , may was warmer and drier than normal and june was actually sunnier than average .
july , however , was much wetter than average , although levels of sunshine were only slightly below normal .
august rainfall wales : 179.6mm england : 101.6mm scotland : 152.5mm northern ireland : 195.1mm up to 26 aug -lrb- source : met office -rrb- bbc wales weather forecaster derek brockway said the reasons for the poor summer were complicated but the jet stream , strong air currents in the atmosphere , had probably played a big part .
" the jet stream steers weather systems across the atlantic and normally it would go up between iceland and scotland bringing low pressure in that area , " he said .
" we would normally get high pressure from the azores but that has not really happened this year .
" this year the jet stream has been further south bringing low pressure and rain to wales . "
the wettest august on record was in 1917 , when 274.3mm of rain fell .
england has been drier than wales in august with 101.6mm , while scotland has seen 152.5mm.
ground conditions only northern ireland has had a wetter august with 195.1mm , which is more than double what it would usually expect for the whole month .
it has been a difficult month for businesses which depend on good weather .
clive bailey , of bailey balloons which operates hot air balloon flights , has seen a huge number of flights cancelled this month .
" we 've had to cancel flights because of ground conditions , " he said " we use llanarth village hall -lsb- in monmouthshire -rsb- , there 's a football pitch there we use as a launch site but the ground is too soft for land rovers .
" there 's also the continual poor weather .
" we would have done 30 or 40 flights in august usually and we 've done four , it 's been that bad . "
but some parts of wales have fared better than others , with flintshire seeing average rainfall for august .
higher areas have tended to get a lot of rain , such as parts of gwynedd and the south-east wales valleys , and parts of pembrokeshire and carmarthenshire have also had a soaking .
mr brockway pointed out , however , that august is usually the wettest summer month in wales anyway .

more than 70 people have now died in the floods and hundreds of thousands are stranded without food or water .
indian soldiers are using boats and helicopters to reach several hundred remote villages .
the flooding occurred as water flowing from nepal caused the kosi river to breach its banks and change course .
the bbc 's sanjoy majumder in bihar says more rain is expected in the next two days so authorities are moving as swiftly as they can to evacuate villages before the waters rise again .
the continuing bad weather is hampering efforts to get aid to about 2.5 million people who have been displaced .
' national calamity ' our correspondent says many of those stranded in remote villages are sitting on the roofs of their submerged homes .
how we rescued survivors see how the river changed course there is an acute shortage of food and some people are eating uncooked rice and drinking stagnant water to stay alive .
tens of thousands of people have crowded into temporary relief camps .
the boat incident took place on friday in the worst-affected district , madhepura , 150km -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- north-east of bihar 's capital , patna .
police said 40 people were saved .
on bhaskar , superintendent of police , told the associated press news agency : " the boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board . "
angry villagers in madhepura said they had no idea where to take shelter and complained they had received no food or aid .
" we have lost everything , " said bimlesh yadav , escaping with his family to a nearby town .
" all our belongings have been submerged in the floodwaters .
we are leaving to save our children . "
mohanlal sharma of the bbc 's hindi service in madhepura said the road between madhepura and purnea districts was under 10 feet of water .
" along the route , i saw thousands of villagers running towards the town .
some were on foot , some on their bicycles .
some were taking their cattle .
villagers have loaded their entire life 's acquisitions on ox-carts and are trying to escape the waters . "
indian pm manmohan singh , who visited the affected areas in bihar on thursday , said the flooding was a " national calamity " .
he has announced an aid package worth $ 230m -lrb- £ 115m -rrb- .
but aid agencies say many of the victims are being moved to temporary shelters which lack basic amenities .
a report released by unicef says there are fears of infectious diseases at the camps .
army and air force helicopters are continuing to provide aid to the flood-ravaged parts and 600 boats are helping with the relief and rescue work .
but the floods have washed away roads and railway tracks , and water and electricity supplies have been affected in many areas .
" this situation is beyond comprehension , " bihar resident , arshad khaqani , told the bbc news website .
nepal 's damage the kosi river flows from nepal where it is called the saptakoshi river .
on 18 august a dam on the saptakoshi burst , triggering the subsequent flooding in bihar .
officials in nepal say hundreds of people there have been hit by illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia and an estimated 50,000 are homeless .
they say nearly 1,000 houses have been completely destroyed .
