that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .
the opening came under police guard sunday afternoon in potsdam near berlin . german muslims , while unhappy with the production , have largely ignored it .
there have been suggestions that " insulting islam " was a gimmick to attract audiences . although there were no threats of violence , police guarded the event as a precaution .
no one protested sunday . while they see the production as a provocation , muslims are not reacting violently , said nurhan soykan , a spokeswoman for the central council of muslims in germany . " our appeals to stay calm have made an impact within the muslim community , " soykan said .
" so we are happy that these provocateurs do not get more attention than they deserve . " art or provocation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish cartoons provoked violent protests around the muslim world director uwe laufenberg said " the satanic verses " production is not meant to be an attack against islam or an attempt to cause controversy , but rather a chance to celebrate an important an literary work . " i hope that it is also a chance to look at what the novel really is about , " laufenberg said . the characters in the production include a prophet named mahound , a thinly disguised reference to mohammed .
after its publication in 1988 , author rushdie was heavily criticized by muslim leaders for insulting islam .
he had to hide for nearly a decade because iran 's spiritual leader , ayatollah khomeini , had ordered all muslims to kill him . laufenberg said rushdie 's novel is one of unity and not " against someone . " the controversial premiere came just days after the release of " fitna , " a 16-minute internet movie by right-wing dutch politician geert wilders , which caused outrage , but not violence among muslims round the world . there were fears that both " the satanic verses " and " fitna " would cause violent reactions similar to those which spread after a series of cartoons making fun of the prophet mohammed first published in danish newspapers . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

bundeswehr training for one such mission is currently underway . even as germany begins training soldiers to be part of a quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- in northern afghanistan , the united states is calling on its allies to be prepared to send more troops . us president george bush and us general dan mcneill weighed in on the issue over the weekend .
mcneill said that while there would be no pressure on germany to take part in fighting in the volatile southern part of the country , he hoped germany would be willing to send more soldiers to the north . it would be " extremely helpful " if the german government could find a few more soldiers to send to the north , said mcneill , head of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . while the north has relatively few violent islamists , there is " a lot of criminality that often comes with drug trafficking , " mcneill told the german der tagesspiegel newspaper in its monday , march 31 edition . hopeful for greater involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has opposed sending troops to southern afghanistan in a change of tone from recent months , the us seemed to signal that it would stop pressuring germany to take part in fighting the taliban in the south . us president george w. bush said he will not use an upcoming nato summit in bucharest summit to press german chancellor angela merkel on the issue . bush made the comments in an interview with german daily die welt , also published on monday . readying for deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in training at bergen barracks have to put their fears aside this summer , germany will send 200 soldiers as part of a quick reaction force to replace a norwegian contingent .
the soldiers will be based in the north , but with the potential to operate in all parts of the country . the training for that mission has already begun .
there 's an almost tangible air of efficiency and high expectations at the bergen barracks in northern germany as men and women recently braced for another day of intense military training and exercises .
dressed in camouflage gear , the troops are focused on making the most out of the time that remains before they 're flown to northern afghanistan . thomas , one of the soldiers in training , said he and his team are doing whatever they can to prepare for their future deployment . " basically , the only thing we ca n't really simulate here are the extreme temperatures , " he said .
" but as far as peculiarities of terrain are concerned , the sand and dust here in the camp is pretty much the same . " he said that the conditions at the training camp outside hannover are not identical to those in afghanistan , but he 's confident the months of training have made him and his fellow soldiers well prepared for the situation on the ground . thomas , like the other young men and two women at bergen make up germany 's qrf , the strategic reserve of nato 's regional command north .
the troops are responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and provide security .
in conflict situations , the qrf is prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary . preparing for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qrf troops are equipped with the modern weaponry , like this machine gun with night vision .
although the german troops hope they will not be forced into a combat situation , they are prepared for the worst .
the bergen training camp has a number of shooting ranges and the qrf troops practice here on a daily basis .
everyone hopes their shooting skills will not be put to a test in afghanistan , but there 's no guarantee . juergen weigt , who will soon head nato 's regional command north , said that the bundeswehr has already lost 26 soldiers in afghanistan . " this proves that the mission in northern afghanistan can not be described as free of risks and danger as some observers and even nato allies tend to do at times , " he said . that 's why the team is taking every precaution while still in germany .
the 200 soldiers are put through a daily barrage of drills , designed to prepare them for different scenarios ranging from armed attacks by extremists to suicide bombings and hostage situations .

qrf team member sabine said she hopes her unit will make a name for itself in a peaceful manner .
she believes that the basic knowledge the team has acquired about afghanistan will come in handy . " we had several lessons about the history and geography of afghanistan , " she said .
" we dealt with the various religious denominations .
and we familiarized ourselves with some of the country 's centuries-old traditions and customs . " sabine said she 's realistic about the dangers she may face while in afghanistan , but she tries not to lose any sleepless nights over it . " if i were to constantly think about the risks involved , i 'd end up a nervous wreck , " she said .

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.03.2008 german minimum wage push gets moderate response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forestry was one of the few sectors that sought a minimum wage a poorer-than-expected response to a german plan to set minimum wage deals in some sectors has led to yet more political debate on the topic . only seven business sectors had applied for a minimum wage by the end of the day monday , march 31 .
that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .
the opening came under police guard sunday afternoon in potsdam near berlin . german muslims , while unhappy with the production , have largely ignored it .
there have been suggestions that " insulting islam " was a gimmick to attract audiences . although there were no threats of violence , police guarded the event as a precaution .
no one protested sunday . while they see the production as a provocation , muslims are not reacting violently , said nurhan soykan , a spokeswoman for the central council of muslims in germany . " our appeals to stay calm have made an impact within the muslim community , " soykan said .
" so we are happy that these provocateurs do not get more attention than they deserve . " art or provocation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish cartoons provoked violent protests around the muslim world director uwe laufenberg said " the satanic verses " production is not meant to be an attack against islam or an attempt to cause controversy , but rather a chance to celebrate an important an literary work . " i hope that it is also a chance to look at what the novel really is about , " laufenberg said . the characters in the production include a prophet named mahound , a thinly disguised reference to mohammed .
after its publication in 1988 , author rushdie was heavily criticized by muslim leaders for insulting islam .
he had to hide for nearly a decade because iran 's spiritual leader , ayatollah khomeini , had ordered all muslims to kill him . laufenberg said rushdie 's novel is one of unity and not " against someone . " the controversial premiere came just days after the release of " fitna , " a 16-minute internet movie by right-wing dutch politician geert wilders , which caused outrage , but not violence among muslims round the world . there were fears that both " the satanic verses " and " fitna " would cause violent reactions similar to those which spread after a series of cartoons making fun of the prophet mohammed first published in danish newspapers . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.03.2008 german minimum wage push gets moderate response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forestry was one of the few sectors that sought a minimum wage a poorer-than-expected response to a german plan to set minimum wage deals in some sectors has led to yet more political debate on the topic . only seven business sectors had applied for a minimum wage by the end of the day monday , march 31 .
that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .
the opening came under police guard sunday afternoon in potsdam near berlin . german muslims , while unhappy with the production , have largely ignored it .
there have been suggestions that " insulting islam " was a gimmick to attract audiences . although there were no threats of violence , police guarded the event as a precaution .
no one protested sunday . while they see the production as a provocation , muslims are not reacting violently , said nurhan soykan , a spokeswoman for the central council of muslims in germany . " our appeals to stay calm have made an impact within the muslim community , " soykan said .
" so we are happy that these provocateurs do not get more attention than they deserve . " art or provocation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish cartoons provoked violent protests around the muslim world director uwe laufenberg said " the satanic verses " production is not meant to be an attack against islam or an attempt to cause controversy , but rather a chance to celebrate an important an literary work . " i hope that it is also a chance to look at what the novel really is about , " laufenberg said . the characters in the production include a prophet named mahound , a thinly disguised reference to mohammed .
after its publication in 1988 , author rushdie was heavily criticized by muslim leaders for insulting islam .
he had to hide for nearly a decade because iran 's spiritual leader , ayatollah khomeini , had ordered all muslims to kill him . laufenberg said rushdie 's novel is one of unity and not " against someone . " the controversial premiere came just days after the release of " fitna , " a 16-minute internet movie by right-wing dutch politician geert wilders , which caused outrage , but not violence among muslims round the world . there were fears that both " the satanic verses " and " fitna " would cause violent reactions similar to those which spread after a series of cartoons making fun of the prophet mohammed first published in danish newspapers . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .
once ukraine is offered a map , opposition will die down , he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .
once ukraine is offered a map , opposition will die down , he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .

while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .

on flights and boat travel between 24 european states , memberse of schengen-zone countries will no longer be asked to show their passports at control stops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-boarding security checks will continue passport controls at airports between the 15 old schengen-accord countries and the nine , recently added schengen countries of estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and malta , were dropped on sunday night , march 30 .
travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .

the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.03.2008 german minimum wage push gets moderate response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forestry was one of the few sectors that sought a minimum wage a poorer-than-expected response to a german plan to set minimum wage deals in some sectors has led to yet more political debate on the topic . only seven business sectors had applied for a minimum wage by the end of the day monday , march 31 .
that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on flights and boat travel between 24 european states , memberse of schengen-zone countries will no longer be asked to show their passports at control stops .

travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
this means travelers still need to have their passports or other official forms of identification with them . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said that the conditions at the training camp outside hannover are not identical to those in afghanistan , but he 's confident the months of training have made him and his fellow soldiers well prepared for the situation on the ground . thomas , like the other young men and two women at bergen make up germany 's qrf , the strategic reserve of nato 's regional command north .
the troops are responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and provide security .
in conflict situations , the qrf is prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary . preparing for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qrf troops are equipped with the modern weaponry , like this machine gun with night vision .
although the german troops hope they will not be forced into a combat situation , they are prepared for the worst .
the bergen training camp has a number of shooting ranges and the qrf troops practice here on a daily basis .
everyone hopes their shooting skills will not be put to a test in afghanistan , but there 's no guarantee . juergen weigt , who will soon head nato 's regional command north , said that the bundeswehr has already lost 26 soldiers in afghanistan . " this proves that the mission in northern afghanistan can not be described as free of risks and danger as some observers and even nato allies tend to do at times , " he said . that 's why the team is taking every precaution while still in germany .
the 200 soldiers are put through a daily barrage of drills , designed to prepare them for different scenarios ranging from armed attacks by extremists to suicide bombings and hostage situations .
qrf has to be ready to step into action at a moment 's notice and secure the upper hand . avoiding sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern germany might not be afghanistan , but soldiers are training as if it were while the risks are very much on the minds of the troops and combat readiness is top on the list of training objectives , the months at bergen barracks have also attuned the soldiers to their role as a de-escalation force in times of conflict .
qrf team member sabine said she hopes her unit will make a name for itself in a peaceful manner .
she believes that the basic knowledge the team has acquired about afghanistan will come in handy . " we had several lessons about the history and geography of afghanistan , " she said .
" we dealt with the various religious denominations .
and we familiarized ourselves with some of the country 's centuries-old traditions and customs . " sabine said she 's realistic about the dangers she may face while in afghanistan , but she tries not to lose any sleepless nights over it . " if i were to constantly think about the risks involved , i 'd end up a nervous wreck , " she said .
" i 've decided for myself that it 's better not to think about it at all .
i can only hope that we 'll be able to return from the mission in one piece . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success .

it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.03.2008 german minimum wage push gets moderate response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forestry was one of the few sectors that sought a minimum wage a poorer-than-expected response to a german plan to set minimum wage deals in some sectors has led to yet more political debate on the topic . only seven business sectors had applied for a minimum wage by the end of the day monday , march 31 .
that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .

the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .

the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity .

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu , germany lead calls for zimbabwe to reveal election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main opposition mdc party claims the results , when released , will give them victory the european union and germany pushed for a swift resolution to the state of limbo surrounding zimbabwe 's presidential elections .
no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 31.03.2008 german finance minister tries makeover with new rap persona großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck : put your hands in the air ... and wave them like you just do n't care in an attempt to sex-up the finance ministry and show the human face behind the numbers and stuffy suits , germany 's top accountant is " getting down with his homies . " when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .
for a short time , rove once again walked in the glow of public adoration . if it worked for karl rove ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl rove : yo !
while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .
a no-nonsense kinda guy who has been advocating tougher security measures ever since he took the job , schaeuble could do with his edges being smoothed out a bit at the best of times . stay tuned for super-soul schaeuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's fingerprint does n't look that special but if ever he was looking for a distraction , now would be the right time to branch out .
after hammering home the message that fingerprinting is the way towards a safer and more secure future , the interior minister might consider releasing a single in the next few days to cover up the fact that hackers have somehow managed to get past all his security policies to steal records of his own dabs . while his fingerprints are loose in the world , schaeuble would be wise to look into a musical tactic to eclipse the irony of the whole affair .
maybe a soulful cover of " your secret 's safe with me " by robert cray or a rockin ' rendition of anthrax 's " i am the law . " it would probably be a good idea , though , to stay clear of barbra streisand 's " what kind of fool " … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness .

in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements .

no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on flights and boat travel between 24 european states , memberse of schengen-zone countries will no longer be asked to show their passports at control stops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-boarding security checks will continue passport controls at airports between the 15 old schengen-accord countries and the nine , recently added schengen countries of estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and malta , were dropped on sunday night , march 30 .
travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
this means travelers still need to have their passports or other official forms of identification with them . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.03.2008 german minimum wage push gets moderate response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forestry was one of the few sectors that sought a minimum wage a poorer-than-expected response to a german plan to set minimum wage deals in some sectors has led to yet more political debate on the topic . only seven business sectors had applied for a minimum wage by the end of the day monday , march 31 .
that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .

on flights and boat travel between 24 european states , memberse of schengen-zone countries will no longer be asked to show their passports at control stops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-boarding security checks will continue passport controls at airports between the 15 old schengen-accord countries and the nine , recently added schengen countries of estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and malta , were dropped on sunday night , march 30 .
travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
this means travelers still need to have their passports or other official forms of identification with them . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

" this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu , germany lead calls for zimbabwe to reveal election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main opposition mdc party claims the results , when released , will give them victory the european union and germany pushed for a swift resolution to the state of limbo surrounding zimbabwe 's presidential elections .
no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers .

" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on flights and boat travel between 24 european states , memberse of schengen-zone countries will no longer be asked to show their passports at control stops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-boarding security checks will continue passport controls at airports between the 15 old schengen-accord countries and the nine , recently added schengen countries of estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and malta , were dropped on sunday night , march 30 .
travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 31.03.2008 german finance minister tries makeover with new rap persona großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck : put your hands in the air ... and wave them like you just do n't care in an attempt to sex-up the finance ministry and show the human face behind the numbers and stuffy suits , germany 's top accountant is " getting down with his homies . " when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .
for a short time , rove once again walked in the glow of public adoration . if it worked for karl rove ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl rove : yo !
while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .
a no-nonsense kinda guy who has been advocating tougher security measures ever since he took the job , schaeuble could do with his edges being smoothed out a bit at the best of times . stay tuned for super-soul schaeuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's fingerprint does n't look that special but if ever he was looking for a distraction , now would be the right time to branch out .
after hammering home the message that fingerprinting is the way towards a safer and more secure future , the interior minister might consider releasing a single in the next few days to cover up the fact that hackers have somehow managed to get past all his security policies to steal records of his own dabs . while his fingerprints are loose in the world , schaeuble would be wise to look into a musical tactic to eclipse the irony of the whole affair .
maybe a soulful cover of " your secret 's safe with me " by robert cray or a rockin ' rendition of anthrax 's " i am the law . " it would probably be a good idea , though , to stay clear of barbra streisand 's " what kind of fool " … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements .

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu calls case against turkish ruling party unjustified großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters , not courts , should determine a country 's political landscape , the eu said a case to close down turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- on suspicion of anti-secular activities is to go ahead after the country 's constitutional court decided in favor of hearing the case . in a short statement made to reporters on monday , march 31 , a constitutional court spokesman said the court had voted to hear the case , including a prosecutor 's move to have prime minister redep tayyip erdogan and dozens of his party colleagues banned from politics for five years . the spokesman said the court will not make any moves to have president abdullah gul banned from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said monday it would hear the case - a verdict is not expected for months the akp now has one month to present its preliminary defense to the court , which has banned more than 20 parties since the 1960s .
the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu calls case against turkish ruling party unjustified großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters , not courts , should determine a country 's political landscape , the eu said a case to close down turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- on suspicion of anti-secular activities is to go ahead after the country 's constitutional court decided in favor of hearing the case . in a short statement made to reporters on monday , march 31 , a constitutional court spokesman said the court had voted to hear the case , including a prosecutor 's move to have prime minister redep tayyip erdogan and dozens of his party colleagues banned from politics for five years . the spokesman said the court will not make any moves to have president abdullah gul banned from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said monday it would hear the case - a verdict is not expected for months the akp now has one month to present its preliminary defense to the court , which has banned more than 20 parties since the 1960s .
the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on flights and boat travel between 24 european states , memberse of schengen-zone countries will no longer be asked to show their passports at control stops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-boarding security checks will continue passport controls at airports between the 15 old schengen-accord countries and the nine , recently added schengen countries of estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and malta , were dropped on sunday night , march 30 .
travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
this means travelers still need to have their passports or other official forms of identification with them . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 31.03.2008 german finance minister tries makeover with new rap persona großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck : put your hands in the air ... and wave them like you just do n't care in an attempt to sex-up the finance ministry and show the human face behind the numbers and stuffy suits , germany 's top accountant is " getting down with his homies . " when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .
for a short time , rove once again walked in the glow of public adoration . if it worked for karl rove ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl rove : yo !
while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .
a no-nonsense kinda guy who has been advocating tougher security measures ever since he took the job , schaeuble could do with his edges being smoothed out a bit at the best of times . stay tuned for super-soul schaeuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's fingerprint does n't look that special but if ever he was looking for a distraction , now would be the right time to branch out .
after hammering home the message that fingerprinting is the way towards a safer and more secure future , the interior minister might consider releasing a single in the next few days to cover up the fact that hackers have somehow managed to get past all his security policies to steal records of his own dabs . while his fingerprints are loose in the world , schaeuble would be wise to look into a musical tactic to eclipse the irony of the whole affair .
maybe a soulful cover of " your secret 's safe with me " by robert cray or a rockin ' rendition of anthrax 's " i am the law . " it would probably be a good idea , though , to stay clear of barbra streisand 's " what kind of fool " … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu , germany lead calls for zimbabwe to reveal election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main opposition mdc party claims the results , when released , will give them victory the european union and germany pushed for a swift resolution to the state of limbo surrounding zimbabwe 's presidential elections .
no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner .

no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu calls case against turkish ruling party unjustified großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters , not courts , should determine a country 's political landscape , the eu said a case to close down turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- on suspicion of anti-secular activities is to go ahead after the country 's constitutional court decided in favor of hearing the case . in a short statement made to reporters on monday , march 31 , a constitutional court spokesman said the court had voted to hear the case , including a prosecutor 's move to have prime minister redep tayyip erdogan and dozens of his party colleagues banned from politics for five years . the spokesman said the court will not make any moves to have president abdullah gul banned from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said monday it would hear the case - a verdict is not expected for months the akp now has one month to present its preliminary defense to the court , which has banned more than 20 parties since the 1960s .
the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .

experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies .

the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc .

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .

most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements .

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

travel by land and sea between those countries has been passport-free since dec .
20 , 2007 .
now , european passport controllers will only check the documents of those who are entering or departing from countries outside the schengen zone .
the wider schengen area includes all 27 eu countries except great britain , ireland , bulgaria , romania and cyprus .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are also members .
security checks still in place the new regulations mean air passengers must be strictly divided according to destination , which requires using different air terminals .
therefore , the end of controls is concurrent with new flight plans being put into effect in europe .
however , pre-boarding security checks will continue , the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
this means travelers still need to have their passports or other official forms of identification with them . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu , germany lead calls for zimbabwe to reveal election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main opposition mdc party claims the results , when released , will give them victory the european union and germany pushed for a swift resolution to the state of limbo surrounding zimbabwe 's presidential elections .
no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bundeswehr training for one such mission is currently underway . even as germany begins training soldiers to be part of a quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- in northern afghanistan , the united states is calling on its allies to be prepared to send more troops . us president george bush and us general dan mcneill weighed in on the issue over the weekend .
mcneill said that while there would be no pressure on germany to take part in fighting in the volatile southern part of the country , he hoped germany would be willing to send more soldiers to the north . it would be " extremely helpful " if the german government could find a few more soldiers to send to the north , said mcneill , head of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . while the north has relatively few violent islamists , there is " a lot of criminality that often comes with drug trafficking , " mcneill told the german der tagesspiegel newspaper in its monday , march 31 edition . hopeful for greater involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has opposed sending troops to southern afghanistan in a change of tone from recent months , the us seemed to signal that it would stop pressuring germany to take part in fighting the taliban in the south . us president george w. bush said he will not use an upcoming nato summit in bucharest summit to press german chancellor angela merkel on the issue . bush made the comments in an interview with german daily die welt , also published on monday . readying for deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in training at bergen barracks have to put their fears aside this summer , germany will send 200 soldiers as part of a quick reaction force to replace a norwegian contingent .
the soldiers will be based in the north , but with the potential to operate in all parts of the country . the training for that mission has already begun .
there 's an almost tangible air of efficiency and high expectations at the bergen barracks in northern germany as men and women recently braced for another day of intense military training and exercises .
dressed in camouflage gear , the troops are focused on making the most out of the time that remains before they 're flown to northern afghanistan . thomas , one of the soldiers in training , said he and his team are doing whatever they can to prepare for their future deployment . " basically , the only thing we ca n't really simulate here are the extreme temperatures , " he said .
" but as far as peculiarities of terrain are concerned , the sand and dust here in the camp is pretty much the same . " he said that the conditions at the training camp outside hannover are not identical to those in afghanistan , but he 's confident the months of training have made him and his fellow soldiers well prepared for the situation on the ground . thomas , like the other young men and two women at bergen make up germany 's qrf , the strategic reserve of nato 's regional command north .
the troops are responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and provide security .
in conflict situations , the qrf is prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary . preparing for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qrf troops are equipped with the modern weaponry , like this machine gun with night vision .
although the german troops hope they will not be forced into a combat situation , they are prepared for the worst .
the bergen training camp has a number of shooting ranges and the qrf troops practice here on a daily basis .
everyone hopes their shooting skills will not be put to a test in afghanistan , but there 's no guarantee . juergen weigt , who will soon head nato 's regional command north , said that the bundeswehr has already lost 26 soldiers in afghanistan . " this proves that the mission in northern afghanistan can not be described as free of risks and danger as some observers and even nato allies tend to do at times , " he said . that 's why the team is taking every precaution while still in germany .
the 200 soldiers are put through a daily barrage of drills , designed to prepare them for different scenarios ranging from armed attacks by extremists to suicide bombings and hostage situations .
qrf has to be ready to step into action at a moment 's notice and secure the upper hand . avoiding sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern germany might not be afghanistan , but soldiers are training as if it were while the risks are very much on the minds of the troops and combat readiness is top on the list of training objectives , the months at bergen barracks have also attuned the soldiers to their role as a de-escalation force in times of conflict .
qrf team member sabine said she hopes her unit will make a name for itself in a peaceful manner .
she believes that the basic knowledge the team has acquired about afghanistan will come in handy . " we had several lessons about the history and geography of afghanistan , " she said .
" we dealt with the various religious denominations .
and we familiarized ourselves with some of the country 's centuries-old traditions and customs . " sabine said she 's realistic about the dangers she may face while in afghanistan , but she tries not to lose any sleepless nights over it . " if i were to constantly think about the risks involved , i 'd end up a nervous wreck , " she said .
" i 've decided for myself that it 's better not to think about it at all .

" we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu calls case against turkish ruling party unjustified großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters , not courts , should determine a country 's political landscape , the eu said a case to close down turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- on suspicion of anti-secular activities is to go ahead after the country 's constitutional court decided in favor of hearing the case . in a short statement made to reporters on monday , march 31 , a constitutional court spokesman said the court had voted to hear the case , including a prosecutor 's move to have prime minister redep tayyip erdogan and dozens of his party colleagues banned from politics for five years . the spokesman said the court will not make any moves to have president abdullah gul banned from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said monday it would hear the case - a verdict is not expected for months the akp now has one month to present its preliminary defense to the court , which has banned more than 20 parties since the 1960s .
the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .
once ukraine is offered a map , opposition will die down , he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .
the opening came under police guard sunday afternoon in potsdam near berlin . german muslims , while unhappy with the production , have largely ignored it .
there have been suggestions that " insulting islam " was a gimmick to attract audiences . although there were no threats of violence , police guarded the event as a precaution .
no one protested sunday . while they see the production as a provocation , muslims are not reacting violently , said nurhan soykan , a spokeswoman for the central council of muslims in germany . " our appeals to stay calm have made an impact within the muslim community , " soykan said .
" so we are happy that these provocateurs do not get more attention than they deserve . " art or provocation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish cartoons provoked violent protests around the muslim world director uwe laufenberg said " the satanic verses " production is not meant to be an attack against islam or an attempt to cause controversy , but rather a chance to celebrate an important an literary work . " i hope that it is also a chance to look at what the novel really is about , " laufenberg said . the characters in the production include a prophet named mahound , a thinly disguised reference to mohammed .
after its publication in 1988 , author rushdie was heavily criticized by muslim leaders for insulting islam .
he had to hide for nearly a decade because iran 's spiritual leader , ayatollah khomeini , had ordered all muslims to kill him . laufenberg said rushdie 's novel is one of unity and not " against someone . " the controversial premiere came just days after the release of " fitna , " a 16-minute internet movie by right-wing dutch politician geert wilders , which caused outrage , but not violence among muslims round the world . there were fears that both " the satanic verses " and " fitna " would cause violent reactions similar to those which spread after a series of cartoons making fun of the prophet mohammed first published in danish newspapers . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .
for a short time , rove once again walked in the glow of public adoration . if it worked for karl rove ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl rove : yo !
while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .
a no-nonsense kinda guy who has been advocating tougher security measures ever since he took the job , schaeuble could do with his edges being smoothed out a bit at the best of times . stay tuned for super-soul schaeuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's fingerprint does n't look that special but if ever he was looking for a distraction , now would be the right time to branch out .
after hammering home the message that fingerprinting is the way towards a safer and more secure future , the interior minister might consider releasing a single in the next few days to cover up the fact that hackers have somehow managed to get past all his security policies to steal records of his own dabs . while his fingerprints are loose in the world , schaeuble would be wise to look into a musical tactic to eclipse the irony of the whole affair .
maybe a soulful cover of " your secret 's safe with me " by robert cray or a rockin ' rendition of anthrax 's " i am the law . " it would probably be a good idea , though , to stay clear of barbra streisand 's " what kind of fool " … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.03.2008 german minimum wage push gets moderate response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forestry was one of the few sectors that sought a minimum wage a poorer-than-expected response to a german plan to set minimum wage deals in some sectors has led to yet more political debate on the topic . only seven business sectors had applied for a minimum wage by the end of the day monday , march 31 .
that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements . " the executive director of the the left party , dietmar bartsch , reiterated his wish that the state should simply create a broad-based minimum hourly wage of 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 31.03.2008 ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine might not be on fast track to join nato even as europe signals mixed support for ukraine 's entry into nato , us president george w. bush will travel to kyiv to show his support for the current government .
but that might not be enough , experts say . the ukrainian government hopes that bush 's visit monday , march 31 , will signal an impending nato membership offer .
but experts believe that bush will more likely try to soften the disappointment over nato 's reluctance to expand its military alliance to include ukraine . some nato members , and germany in particular , oppose offering ukraine and georgia the coveted membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at the upcoming nato summit in bucharest .
the plan is one of the last steps before full membership in the trans-atlantic alliance , which still requires a vote by existing members .
membership for ukraine and georgia , as well as nato troops in afghanistan , is expected to get top billing at the summit , which starts wednesday . ukraine 's pro-western government headed by president viktor yushchenko badly wants into the nato club . but the country 's chances of being offered a map when the summit starts are about 50-50 , according to experts . bush unlikely to champion cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has been supportive of ukraine in the past bush , who recently met with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , is a vocal supporter of nato membership for both countries .
he plans to visit the ukrainian capital kyiv on monday and tuesday on his way to bucharest . bush 's national security advisor , stephen hadley , said bush will not force the expansion issue and would continue to pursue " quiet consultations " with nato members . bush is already locked in a testy back-and-forth with russia over us missile defense .
experts say he 's unlikely to push nato expansion .
the bush visit can more be seen as a sign of moral support , said vadim karasev , head of the ukrainian institute for global strategies . " this is a very symbolic visit from a psychological and political view , " karasev said . because of the decision 's important political ramifications , ukraine 's leadership would be naive to count on bush 's unequivocal support , karasev said . not all ukrainians love nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown skepticism over ukraine 's nato bid it 's not only current nato members who are divided on ukraine . the country 's government is split between the ruling coalition , which supports nato , and the opposition , which wants nothing to do with it . when ukraine 's government sent a letter to nato in january declaring itself ready to begin with its map in april , the opposition reacted strongly .
the pro-russian party of regions together with the communists stalled parliamentary business for more than a month by insisting that any nato membership be agreed to by a national referendum . some opposition members are planning protests during bush 's visit .
party of regions leader viktor yanukovych has been championing a possible friendship and cooperation agreement with russia as an alternative to nato membership . russia 's influence continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all ukrainians want to be part of nato there 's a sense among party of regions members that ukraine 's future does not lie with the west . vadim kolesnichenko , a parliamentarian for the party , said that people need to understand the negative consequences joining nato would have on the country 's prosperity . " the us is far away , but russia is very close , " kolesnichenko said . this week 's summit will be a chance to talk about the nato action plan and also the position of russia to the question , said parliamentarian serhii shevchuk of the pro-western yulia tymoshenko bloc . " each time that nato was enlarged , starting with the countries in central and eastern europe , russia was outraged and fought to stop it , " shevchuk said .
" this was especially the case when the baltic countries joined nato .
and it 's occurring for the third time . " russia 's unhappiness is to be expected , but wo n't last , shevchuk said .

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .
the opening came under police guard sunday afternoon in potsdam near berlin . german muslims , while unhappy with the production , have largely ignored it .
there have been suggestions that " insulting islam " was a gimmick to attract audiences . although there were no threats of violence , police guarded the event as a precaution .
no one protested sunday . while they see the production as a provocation , muslims are not reacting violently , said nurhan soykan , a spokeswoman for the central council of muslims in germany . " our appeals to stay calm have made an impact within the muslim community , " soykan said .
" so we are happy that these provocateurs do not get more attention than they deserve . " art or provocation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish cartoons provoked violent protests around the muslim world director uwe laufenberg said " the satanic verses " production is not meant to be an attack against islam or an attempt to cause controversy , but rather a chance to celebrate an important an literary work . " i hope that it is also a chance to look at what the novel really is about , " laufenberg said . the characters in the production include a prophet named mahound , a thinly disguised reference to mohammed .
after its publication in 1988 , author rushdie was heavily criticized by muslim leaders for insulting islam .
he had to hide for nearly a decade because iran 's spiritual leader , ayatollah khomeini , had ordered all muslims to kill him . laufenberg said rushdie 's novel is one of unity and not " against someone . " the controversial premiere came just days after the release of " fitna , " a 16-minute internet movie by right-wing dutch politician geert wilders , which caused outrage , but not violence among muslims round the world . there were fears that both " the satanic verses " and " fitna " would cause violent reactions similar to those which spread after a series of cartoons making fun of the prophet mohammed first published in danish newspapers . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was the deadline set by politicians for business sectors under a deal put forth by germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and workers ' unions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : röttgen says minimum wage will bring joblessness the number is fewer than the 10 to 12 hoped for by the spd , and also included smaller industries , representing just 1.43 million workers .
these include specialized mining workers , with just 2,500 employees , and other industries such as temp workers , security guards , industrial laundries , forestry workers , nurses ' aides , and career trainers . german labor minister olaf scholz , of the spd , said he was happy with the results , and called them a " gigantic political success . "
it would double the number of workers who are currently protected from wage-dumping competition under the entsendegesetz , a german law enacted to protect construction workers from cheap labor . even after the deadline passes , scholz said , other branches are allowed to enter the protection of the law . however , the spd had originally predicted it would garner more important sectors representing 4.4 million workers . response surprises spd christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as german business leaders have said the lack of interest is an expression of support for their anti-minimum-wage position . in contrast , the spd continues to demand a minimum wage .
and the green party and the left party are seeking a unified minimum wage for all business sectors . last year , the cdu and spd , which make up germany 's grand coalition government , had struck a deal , saying employers and unions could apply for a minimum wage in their sector .
the application deadline was march 31 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit : government should step in where industry fails the weak turnout came as a surprise to the spd leaders , who had previously demanded a unified , cross-sector minimum wage .
most cdu politicians had opposed the plan , and thus the compromise of a branch-by-branch application process was reached . germany 's economy minister michael glos , of the cdu 's sister party csu , told the bild newspaper that the low response shows business branches themselves " knew best what was good for them , and minimum wage is n't part of it . " cdu parliamentarian norbert röttgen told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily that " the overwhelming majority " of workers opposed a minimum wage " because they know it brings joblessness . " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla told the german weekly paper welt am sonntag that the spd had made an " error in calculations " in making the minimum wage a major point in state election campaigns . left vows to continue the fight but while right-leaning parties are claiming the topic is now dead as a campaign issue , others are sticking to their guns on the issue . the spd will continue to fight for a general minimum wage , berlin mayor klaus wowereit told reporters on monday , adding that the topic is anything but off the table in terms of election politics . the fact that few sectors applied for the wage only reflects the lack of power that stands behind the unions , he said .
in that case , " the state needs to take an active role , " wowereit said . green party economics expert brigitte pothmer also noted that the weak response to the legislation was simply more proof than ever that " we need binding minimum wages in branches that have poor tariff agreements .

" when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .
for a short time , rove once again walked in the glow of public adoration . if it worked for karl rove ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl rove : yo !
while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .
a no-nonsense kinda guy who has been advocating tougher security measures ever since he took the job , schaeuble could do with his edges being smoothed out a bit at the best of times . stay tuned for super-soul schaeuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's fingerprint does n't look that special but if ever he was looking for a distraction , now would be the right time to branch out .
after hammering home the message that fingerprinting is the way towards a safer and more secure future , the interior minister might consider releasing a single in the next few days to cover up the fact that hackers have somehow managed to get past all his security policies to steal records of his own dabs . while his fingerprints are loose in the world , schaeuble would be wise to look into a musical tactic to eclipse the irony of the whole affair .
maybe a soulful cover of " your secret 's safe with me " by robert cray or a rockin ' rendition of anthrax 's " i am the law . " it would probably be a good idea , though , to stay clear of barbra streisand 's " what kind of fool " … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a no-nonsense kinda guy who has been advocating tougher security measures ever since he took the job , schaeuble could do with his edges being smoothed out a bit at the best of times . stay tuned for super-soul schaeuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's fingerprint does n't look that special but if ever he was looking for a distraction , now would be the right time to branch out .
after hammering home the message that fingerprinting is the way towards a safer and more secure future , the interior minister might consider releasing a single in the next few days to cover up the fact that hackers have somehow managed to get past all his security policies to steal records of his own dabs . while his fingerprints are loose in the world , schaeuble would be wise to look into a musical tactic to eclipse the irony of the whole affair .
maybe a soulful cover of " your secret 's safe with me " by robert cray or a rockin ' rendition of anthrax 's " i am the law . " it would probably be a good idea , though , to stay clear of barbra streisand 's " what kind of fool " … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .
this includes the freedom to pray , including muslim prayer . educators chastise senator zoellner 's hands-off attitude was strongly attacked by some german educators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , berlin began offering buddhism lessons in school " i will not allow prayer in school , despite everything , " gerhard raehme , the principal of the carl-von-ossietzky upper school in berlin told the tagesspiegel newspaper . zoellner 's decision not to contest the court ruling was a wrong one , raehme added .
he warned that the case could set off a series of copycat cases leading muslim youths around the country to seek the right to pray in school . " after the easter break we might see a strong increase in demand for such prayer rooms in schools " rose-marie seggelke told tagesspiegel .
" it could become problematic if rival school groups abuse the topic . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc .

" eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .

" when it comes to professions in drastic need of an image makeover , politicians must be quite high on the list .
their public personas range from stuffy and boring civil servants to lying cheats and messianic warmongers . putting a likeable human face to the job is often one of the hardest tasks a politician will come up against . of all the jobs in politics , few suffer as badly as the finance minister .
often described as the country 's top accountant - a kiss of death if ever there was one - finance ministers lack the globe-trotting , war-zone-visiting sexiness of the foreign ministry portfolio or the mad-eyed thirst for power and control that defense and interior ministers tend to acquire .
if the generic title of politician is inherently boring , then minister of finance equates to " dull as dishwater . " what is a poor primo number-cruncher to do ?
taking a leaf from his dashing and surprisingly adept colleague frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck has decided to try and revamp his image by embracing music . and while foreign minister steinmeier played safe with a middle-of-the-road rock song for his much publicized duet with his french counterpart , bernard koucher , steinbrueck has really taken the plunge into uncharted waters by attempting that most difficult and potentially cringe-worthy genre known to doughy white males - rap . peer goes off the deep end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peerizzle steinbrizzle bigs up the bundestag much like watching your dad trying to dance to nirvana at a wedding reception , a balding middle-aged politician attempting to " get hip " with his hugo boss suit trousers at half-mast and an ill-advised baseball cap on at a jaunty angle is akin to being flayed alive . however , steinbrueck - or " rappeer der nation " as he is excruciatingly called in his online video performance - seems to have taken heart from the kudos afforded former george w. bush aide karl rove after his own painful attempt at urban cool . despite rove 's eventual and spectacular fall from grace soon after his rapping performance at last year 's white house correspondents association dinner , the show he put on distracted the public from his use of the political black arts and his manipulation and exploitation of innocents .
for a short time , rove once again walked in the glow of public adoration . if it worked for karl rove ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl rove : yo !
while steinbrueck has nothing so shocking to distract his public from , he does seem to be hoping to get more than a few " shout-outs " of his own for his performance of " i love cash " and the fact that his ministry is forecasting no ill effects from the recent global financial crisis on the german economy . depending on how rappeer 's parallel career in the music industry goes , other german politicians may look to join the craze in an attempt to bury a few of their own bodies . take interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for instance .

he 'll be able to pray on school grounds but not during class time . in response to a recent court decision that said a berlin high school must provide a muslim student with a prayer room , a debate has flared up that pits religious freedom against a german law to keep public institutions religion-neutral . berlin senator for education juergen zoellner defended his decision not to contest the court 's decision .
the state expects the " place of education , the school , to act neutrally , " zoellner told rbb inforadio . he was afraid any action could be perceived as " trying to influence the content " of the legal case , which is still awaiting a second phase . law vs. neutrality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers have lost fights to wear headscarves in the classroom on march 10 , 2008 , in expedited proceedings , a berlin administrative court said the diesterweg upper school must provide a 14-year-old muslim student with a space to perform his daily prayers .
the prayers were to take place outside of class time , but still on school grounds . the ruling from the expedited proceedings is a stopgap decision , until the full court hearing takes place .
a date for full proceedings has not yet been set . according to the court , the muslim student sought the ruling because his religion requires him to pray five times a day at specific times .
yet the school had not allowed him to pray , citing its constitutional neutrality law , which stops the state from identifying with any given religion in a public institution . the judge , however , cited german basic law , which allows for freedom of religion .
this basic right does n't only apply to internal freedom , but to external freedom , the justice decided .

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .

many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german inflation hit 3.2 percent in november last year which was its highest rate since 1994 . the statistics office data , based on six key german states , showed that food costs climbed 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis , while non-alcoholic drinks gained 9.6 percent .
some fuels rose by as much as 44.3 percent .
the federal statistics office is scheduled to present a comprehensive report on april 16 . germans could expect still higher prices down the line , with several providers of electricity planning a new hike in prices in april . the pick-up in consumer prices in europe 's biggest economy raises the prospects of inflation in the 15-member euro zone again overshooting the european central bank 's 2 percent annual inflation target . inflation expected to stay high during 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices in germany rose by over 7 percent last week , analysts forecasted euro zone inflation would remain at about 3.0 percent for much of 2008 and only begin to ease off in the second half of the year .
many agreed that the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the european central bank in the next few months was decreasing in light of growing price pressures . according to experts , the increase in march was due partly to a renewed increase in core prices , a worrying sign that inflation could be deeper rooted than in recent months . the record inflation came as confidence in the euro-zone economy fell more than expected in march , hitting the lowest level in nearly two and a half years , according to a survey from the european commission . its economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone fell to 99.6 points in march from 100.2 in february , hitting the lowest level since november 2005 and falling short of economists ' forecasts for 99.9 points . the european union 's executive arm blamed the bleaker outlook on weaker confidence in the services and construction sector while consumer confidence held steady . " this heightens concern about the strength of euro-zone domestic demand going forward , while exports are coming under increasing pressure from a deteriorating global economic environment and a record high euro , " economist howard archer at consultants global insight said in an interview with afp . despite the weakness in the euro zone 's outlook , confidence in the economy of 27-nation european union rose to 102.0 points from 100.3 , boosted by an improvement in british services sector , the commission said . germany records slight upturn in confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's wavering economic confidence is slightly up at the national level , european powerhouse germany saw a slight improvement in overall economic confidence while the french outlook remained largely stable . however , the netherlands , spain and italy all saw sharp deteriorations in the outlook for their economies while britain enjoyed surging confidence in the face of major financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions . despite the darker euro zone outlook , the commission said that its separate business climate indicator for the bloc improved in march , rising to 0.80 points in march from 0.71 in february and halting a three-month decline . " the relatively high level of the indicator points to sustained industrial production growth in the first quarter of this year , " the commission said . rising food and energy costs resulted in consumer prices in germany edging up to 3.1 percent in march , data released friday showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu , germany lead calls for zimbabwe to reveal election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main opposition mdc party claims the results , when released , will give them victory the european union and germany pushed for a swift resolution to the state of limbo surrounding zimbabwe 's presidential elections .
no official results have been released almost two days after polling booths closed . zimbabwe 's opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , which has claimed victory in the elections on saturday , march 29 , expressed alarm at the slow pace of counting monday as results trickling in showing president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the mdc neck and neck . the european union , germany and britain echoed calls for the government to issue the results without delay while new zealand 's prime minister helen clark called the long wait " a worry . " a speedy announcement was necessary " to demonstrate the zimbabwe election commission 's independence and to avoid unnecessary speculation , " a spokesman for the eu 's development and humanitarian aid commission said .
british foreign secretary david miliband reminded mugabe " the international community is watching events closely . " germany voiced satisfaction at the peaceful course of the zimbabwe elections - the country held combined presidential , parliamentary and local elections at the weekend - but expressed concern at the slow pace of vote counting .
the delays could raise questions about manipulation , a foreign ministry spokesman said . germany monitors elections " with great concern " berlin appealed to those responsible in zimbabwe to ensure the vote counting is concluded speedily , transparently and in a proper manner . " the federal government is monitoring the situation with great concern , " the spokesman added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans voted on saturday and still have no results arnold vaatz , the vice chairman of the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- faction in the german parliament , expressed his party 's concern , saying , " more than 30 hours after the voting booths were closed , the national electoral committee in zimbabwe still can not reveal to the world even partial results . " the european union is quietly fearful that any indication or suspicion of a tampered election could lead to the kind of violence witnessed earlier this year in kenya being repeated on the streets of harare and beyond . with 66 of 210 assembly seats counted , both the mdc , led by morgan tsvangirai and zanu-pf had taken 35 seats each , the zimbabwe election commission announced in harare .
no results have been announced in the presidential vote , in which mugabe is battling to secure another five years in power . the close race suggested by the official results contrasted with the mdc 's own unofficial vote count , which it said showed the party taking 96 out of 128 constituencies from which it had results . opposition suspects election rigging by mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of fixing the vote to retain power the discrepancy , the snail 's pace at which the results were being issued and the neat 50-50 split in each batch of votes released have fuelled suspicions in mdc ranks of attempts to " cook " the result in 84-year-old mugabe 's favor . mdc secretary general tendai biti told a press conference in harare that he would not be surprised if vote rigging was still taking place . " we 're standing by for street action , " said eddie cross , an mp for the mdc who retained his seat in bulawayo . the pace of the count , which zec has put down to logistical issues and a need to " verify " the votes , has also caused consternation among local and international observers . " it 's too slow , " noel kututwa of the zimbabwe election support network -lrb- zesn -rrb- election watchdog told the dpa news agency .
" we 're very concerned with the speed . " reports of irregularities , intimidation leak out on sunday , the 14-nation southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- gave the elections a qualified thumbs-up , describing them as " peaceful " and " credible " before the count was over and despite the objections of two south african observers . the observers did , however , express concern over a number of irregularities , including the presence of police in polling stations during voting . on monday , three members of the youth league of south africa 's ruling african national congress returned home early complaining of harassment by the feared cio or secret service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mdc leader tsvangirai wants to avoid a repeat of 2002 fearing a repeat of the 2002 presidential elections , in which mugabe defeated tsvangirai by 400,000 votes after large-scale voter intimidation and some evidence of rigging , the mdc rushed to unilaterally claim victory sunday . " we have won this election , " biti declared , hours after the close of polls .
tsvangirai , 56 , has not been seen in public since the polls . in remarks carried in the state-controlled sunday mail , government spokesman george charamba warned the mdc 's unilateral victory claim was tantamount to a coup d 'etat .
" and we all know how coups are handled , " he added . mdc claims harare success provisional results posted on polling station doors had shown the mdc and tsvangirai sweeping harare and showing strongly in some rural areas that were once ruling party strongholds .
the party also topped the poll in the second-largest city bulawayo . the mdc said monday it had taken photos of the results as proof . ex-finance minister simba makoni , 58 , who was ejected from zanu-pf for standing against mugabe , appeared to be running a distant third . the streets of harare were gripped by an uneasy calm monday as riot police patrolled the streets and residents remained mostly in their neighborhoods . saturday 's largely peaceful elections were seen mainly as a vote on the economic chaos wrought by mugabe 's populist policies , which have resulted in six-figure inflation and widespread food , fuel and drug shortages . among the early casualties in zanu-pf was justice minister patrick chinamasa , who was defeated in his rural eastern constituency . mugabe , who declared himself confident to add another five years to his 28 years in power , has vowed to respect the wishes of zimbabweans but also said recently the mdc would " never " govern . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 31.03.2008 eu calls case against turkish ruling party unjustified großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters , not courts , should determine a country 's political landscape , the eu said a case to close down turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- on suspicion of anti-secular activities is to go ahead after the country 's constitutional court decided in favor of hearing the case . in a short statement made to reporters on monday , march 31 , a constitutional court spokesman said the court had voted to hear the case , including a prosecutor 's move to have prime minister redep tayyip erdogan and dozens of his party colleagues banned from politics for five years . the spokesman said the court will not make any moves to have president abdullah gul banned from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said monday it would hear the case - a verdict is not expected for months the akp now has one month to present its preliminary defense to the court , which has banned more than 20 parties since the 1960s .
the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court is expected to issue a final verdict in six months . threat to secular state ? turkey 's chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya earlier this month lodged an indictment against the akp seeking to have the party banned on the basis that it was a focal point for anti-secular activities . yalcinkaya listed a range of activities in his indictment arguing they were proof that the akp sought to undermine the secular state . they included moves to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of applicants . government has other priorities erdogan 's akp has fought a number of battles with hard-line secularists who fear that moderate islamist moves by the party will ultimately lead to turkey becoming an islamic state with shariah law . the government worked to move the focus away from the court ruling , emphasizing that it had other priorities . " we are more concerned with issues like reforms , economic development and the process of eu accession , " deputy prime minister cemil cicek said after a cabinet meeting . eu : no justification for case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling could affect turkey 's accession talks with the eu the european union , which opposed the court ruling on a party ban , has urged the constitutional court to take turkey 's interests into consideration when making its decision , warning that the case could hit ankara 's drive to join the bloc . " i do not see any such justification for this case , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said monday . he added that " the kind of political issues referred to in this case are debated in the parliament and decided through the ballot box , not in courtrooms . " eu sources told reuters news agency that talk of suspension was premature since the court had not yet heard what was likely to be a lengthy case and the outcome was uncertain .
constitutional reforms might also change the picture . turkey began entry negotiations in 2005 but has made only slow progress , partly because of the unresolved cyprus dispute but also because of slow progress in eu-mandated reforms and reluctance in some eu countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bundeswehr training for one such mission is currently underway . even as germany begins training soldiers to be part of a quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- in northern afghanistan , the united states is calling on its allies to be prepared to send more troops . us president george bush and us general dan mcneill weighed in on the issue over the weekend .
mcneill said that while there would be no pressure on germany to take part in fighting in the volatile southern part of the country , he hoped germany would be willing to send more soldiers to the north . it would be " extremely helpful " if the german government could find a few more soldiers to send to the north , said mcneill , head of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . while the north has relatively few violent islamists , there is " a lot of criminality that often comes with drug trafficking , " mcneill told the german der tagesspiegel newspaper in its monday , march 31 edition . hopeful for greater involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has opposed sending troops to southern afghanistan in a change of tone from recent months , the us seemed to signal that it would stop pressuring germany to take part in fighting the taliban in the south . us president george w. bush said he will not use an upcoming nato summit in bucharest summit to press german chancellor angela merkel on the issue . bush made the comments in an interview with german daily die welt , also published on monday . readying for deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in training at bergen barracks have to put their fears aside this summer , germany will send 200 soldiers as part of a quick reaction force to replace a norwegian contingent .
the soldiers will be based in the north , but with the potential to operate in all parts of the country . the training for that mission has already begun .
there 's an almost tangible air of efficiency and high expectations at the bergen barracks in northern germany as men and women recently braced for another day of intense military training and exercises .
dressed in camouflage gear , the troops are focused on making the most out of the time that remains before they 're flown to northern afghanistan . thomas , one of the soldiers in training , said he and his team are doing whatever they can to prepare for their future deployment . " basically , the only thing we ca n't really simulate here are the extreme temperatures , " he said .
" but as far as peculiarities of terrain are concerned , the sand and dust here in the camp is pretty much the same . " he said that the conditions at the training camp outside hannover are not identical to those in afghanistan , but he 's confident the months of training have made him and his fellow soldiers well prepared for the situation on the ground . thomas , like the other young men and two women at bergen make up germany 's qrf , the strategic reserve of nato 's regional command north .
the troops are responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and provide security .
in conflict situations , the qrf is prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary . preparing for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qrf troops are equipped with the modern weaponry , like this machine gun with night vision .
although the german troops hope they will not be forced into a combat situation , they are prepared for the worst .
the bergen training camp has a number of shooting ranges and the qrf troops practice here on a daily basis .
everyone hopes their shooting skills will not be put to a test in afghanistan , but there 's no guarantee . juergen weigt , who will soon head nato 's regional command north , said that the bundeswehr has already lost 26 soldiers in afghanistan . " this proves that the mission in northern afghanistan can not be described as free of risks and danger as some observers and even nato allies tend to do at times , " he said . that 's why the team is taking every precaution while still in germany .
the 200 soldiers are put through a daily barrage of drills , designed to prepare them for different scenarios ranging from armed attacks by extremists to suicide bombings and hostage situations .
qrf has to be ready to step into action at a moment 's notice and secure the upper hand . avoiding sleepless nights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern germany might not be afghanistan , but soldiers are training as if it were while the risks are very much on the minds of the troops and combat readiness is top on the list of training objectives , the months at bergen barracks have also attuned the soldiers to their role as a de-escalation force in times of conflict .
qrf team member sabine said she hopes her unit will make a name for itself in a peaceful manner .
she believes that the basic knowledge the team has acquired about afghanistan will come in handy . " we had several lessons about the history and geography of afghanistan , " she said .
" we dealt with the various religious denominations .
and we familiarized ourselves with some of the country 's centuries-old traditions and customs . " sabine said she 's realistic about the dangers she may face while in afghanistan , but she tries not to lose any sleepless nights over it . " if i were to constantly think about the risks involved , i 'd end up a nervous wreck , " she said .
" i 've decided for myself that it 's better not to think about it at all .
i can only hope that we 'll be able to return from the mission in one piece . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said both productions would only serve islamist radicalism . " i can assure you that the fundamentalists are extremely gratified by it , " he told deutschlandradio kultur , a national public radio channel .
" they can use it to boost their position . " both the play and the movie were like a game of tennis , nirumand said , where one player takes advantage of the other 's bad hits .
he called on western intellectuals to stop the provocation and take a more nuanced view of islam . " these allegedly artistic productions simply equate all islam with violence , " he said . public violence did n't occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nirumand called the play a " pure provocation " police had feared violent protests at the world theater premier of " the satanic verses , " a controversial novel by indian-born author salman rushdie .
the opening came under police guard sunday afternoon in potsdam near berlin . german muslims , while unhappy with the production , have largely ignored it .
there have been suggestions that " insulting islam " was a gimmick to attract audiences . although there were no threats of violence , police guarded the event as a precaution .
no one protested sunday . while they see the production as a provocation , muslims are not reacting violently , said nurhan soykan , a spokeswoman for the central council of muslims in germany . " our appeals to stay calm have made an impact within the muslim community , " soykan said .
" so we are happy that these provocateurs do not get more attention than they deserve . " art or provocation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish cartoons provoked violent protests around the muslim world director uwe laufenberg said " the satanic verses " production is not meant to be an attack against islam or an attempt to cause controversy , but rather a chance to celebrate an important an literary work . " i hope that it is also a chance to look at what the novel really is about , " laufenberg said . the characters in the production include a prophet named mahound , a thinly disguised reference to mohammed .
after its publication in 1988 , author rushdie was heavily criticized by muslim leaders for insulting islam .
he had to hide for nearly a decade because iran 's spiritual leader , ayatollah khomeini , had ordered all muslims to kill him . laufenberg said rushdie 's novel is one of unity and not " against someone . " the controversial premiere came just days after the release of " fitna , " a 16-minute internet movie by right-wing dutch politician geert wilders , which caused outrage , but not violence among muslims round the world . there were fears that both " the satanic verses " and " fitna " would cause violent reactions similar to those which spread after a series of cartoons making fun of the prophet mohammed first published in danish newspapers . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an experiment revealed that the rooks would team up so they could reach a tray of food that was inaccessible to lone birds .
the researchers from the university of cambridge were surprised to find that the birds performed as well as chimpanzees at the test .
the research is published in the journal proceedings of the royal society b. the researchers presented pairs of captive birds with a tray topped with tasty morsels of egg yolk and mealworm - however , it was placed just out of reach , outside of the birds ' cage .
a single piece of string was threaded through two hooks on the tray , with each end left dangling 60cm -lrb- 24in -rrb- apart , just inside the rooks ' enclosure .
psychologist amanda seed , the lead author of the paper , who is now based at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in germany , said : " if just one bird pulled on one end of the string , it would slip out from the loops .
" the question was would they work out , without any training , that they needed one bird to pull on one end of the string and another to pull on the other , simultaneously , to get to the food ? "
the team , including nicola clayton and nathan emery , discovered that the eight pairs were happy to cooperate , with some pairs solving the task straight away , others taking a day or two to work out that team-work was the key to getting their nibbles .
dr seed told the bbc news website : " they performed remarkably well - as well as chimps when they were presented with the same test . "
the team then gave the rooks another trial .
this time a single rook was presented with the same tray-string set-up , while its pair waited in a neighbouring cage linked by a one-way flap .
the idea was to see whether the rook would wait for the other rook to enter the enclosure so they could once again work together to reach the food .
dr seed said : " we found the birds just did n't wait . "
the researchers believe that while rooks had the ability to cooperate , they may have failed to understand the importance and value of the act .
dr seed said : " the results suggest the rooks were n't using information about the efficacy of the partner : the need for the partner to solve that task . "
however , chimps , when presented with the same scenario were happy to wait and team-up .
dr seed explained : " in terms of the cognitive mechanisms underpinning co-operation , there may be a difference between rooks and chimps .
" this could be because social groups of rooks and chimpanzees are structured differently .
" chimpanzee society is a dynamic mix of cooperative and competitive relationships , whilst rook groups seem to be more stable . "
rooks -lrb- corvus frugilegus -rrb- are members of the crow family .
they live in colonies and form monogamous relationships for life .
the researchers are now keen to find out if other species of birds perform his kind of co-operative behaviour .

advertisement rooks team up to pull a food-laden tray into their enclosure pairs of rooks can co-operate to solve problems , scientists report .
an experiment revealed that the rooks would team up so they could reach a tray of food that was inaccessible to lone birds .
the researchers from the university of cambridge were surprised to find that the birds performed as well as chimpanzees at the test .
the research is published in the journal proceedings of the royal society b. the researchers presented pairs of captive birds with a tray topped with tasty morsels of egg yolk and mealworm - however , it was placed just out of reach , outside of the birds ' cage .
a single piece of string was threaded through two hooks on the tray , with each end left dangling 60cm -lrb- 24in -rrb- apart , just inside the rooks ' enclosure .
psychologist amanda seed , the lead author of the paper , who is now based at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in germany , said : " if just one bird pulled on one end of the string , it would slip out from the loops .
rooks form monogamous relationships for life and live in colonies " the question was would they work out , without any training , that they needed one bird to pull on one end of the string and another to pull on the other , simultaneously , to get to the food ? "
the team , including nicola clayton and nathan emery , discovered that the eight pairs were happy to cooperate , with some pairs solving the task straight away , others taking a day or two to work out that team-work was the key to getting their nibbles .
dr seed told the bbc news website : " they performed remarkably well - as well as chimps when they were presented with the same test . "
the team then gave the rooks another trial .
this time a single rook was presented with the same tray-string set-up , while its pair waited in a neighbouring cage linked by a one-way flap .
the idea was to see whether the rook would wait for the other rook to enter the enclosure so they could once again work together to reach the food .
dr seed said : " we found the birds just did n't wait . "
the researchers believe that while rooks had the ability to cooperate , they may have failed to understand the importance and value of the act .
dr seed said : " the results suggest the rooks were n't using information about the efficacy of the partner : the need for the partner to solve that task . "
however , chimps , when presented with the same scenario were happy to wait and team-up .
dr seed explained : " in terms of the cognitive mechanisms underpinning co-operation , there may be a difference between rooks and chimps .
" this could be because social groups of rooks and chimpanzees are structured differently .
" chimpanzee society is a dynamic mix of cooperative and competitive relationships , whilst rook groups seem to be more stable . "
rooks -lrb- corvus frugilegus -rrb- are members of the crow family .
they live in colonies and form monogamous relationships for life .
the researchers are now keen to find out if other species of birds perform his kind of co-operative behaviour .

panorama has uncovered a number of alleged abuse cases at another home on the island and tracked down one of the abusers - believed by the police to be dead - but in reality very much alive and living in france .
when haute de la garenne was closed in 1986 the children were transferred to smaller units - one such unit was blanche pierre run by jane and alan maguire , who for ten years opened their doors to troubled , lonely or vulnerable children .
brutal regime panorama has spoken to seven former residents of the home who all recall abuse .
all tell similar stories of being trapped in a brutal regime of physical and mental torture .
they put dettol in my mouth and swilled it round and it went down my throat and it burnt my throat darren former resident jean michel recalled : " me and my sister would always argue over petty little things you know , end up in little squabbles from it , therefore you just sort of had a little sharp tongue , we 'd have soap rammed down our throat for it ... "
" it would be grated all along the back of your teeth and his nails would be all against the top of the roof of your mouth . "
severe pain another former resident of blanche pierre , darren said : " they put dettol in my mouth and swilled it round and it went down my throat and it burnt my throat .
darren says he had dettol poured into his mouth " i could hardly breathe , i was in severe pain , i was screaming because my throat swelled up , i could not breathe and i was burning because it 's undiluted dettol in my mouth and my throat .
" -lrb- they -rrb- did n't even take me to the doctors or anything .
i could n't breathe properly , i could n't eat properly , i could n't talk properly and it hurt . "
a neighbour of the maguire 's recalled some of the treatment given out to the children .
joyce symons said : " darren an older child was put in the corner of the playroom and he was left there to stand sometimes all day in the corner and i would be by my kitchen and the window , my kitchen window looks into the playroom and he 'd be stood there crying , a beautiful looking child and it used to make me cry and he used to be hit by what i thought was a stick . "
she said : " alan maguire was the one who inflicted the punishment and jane maguire would just sit by and let it happen . "
new job in 1990 , two staff complained about the maguires ' behaviour to the authorities who took action after a fashion .
the couple were allowed to ' retire ' from blanche pierre and even sent a letter from the education committee thanking them for their " 110 % commitment and hard work , the proof of which will live on in the children for whom you have shown much love and care " .
panorama tracked alan maguire down to a village in france remarkably , jane maguire was then allowed to take up a new job with the local authority which meant she continued to work with children and disadvantaged adults .
years after the first complaints about the maguires , the police were finally called .
former residents , neighbours and staff gave statements and the case even got as far as a magistrates court .
alan maguire was said to have been suffering from liver cancer , and the case was eventually abandoned due to " insufficient evidence " .
finally after a further year , a confidential report , by the health and social services department , catalogued the extent of the abuse .
it found jane maguire guilty of gross misconduct and recommended her dismissal .
nine years after the first complaints she finally left social services .
the police have long believed that alan maguire died of a terminal illness .
however panorama tracked both he and his wife down to a small village in the south of france .

sceptics argue that it is not a practical way to try to deal with the stresses of modern life .
but the long years when adherents were unable to point to hard science to support their belief in the technique may finally be coming to an end .
when carol cattley 's husband died it triggered a relapse of the depression which had not plagued her since she was a teenager .
" i instantly felt as if i wanted to die , " she said .
" i could n't think of what else to do . "
carol sought medical help and managed to control her depression with a combination of medication and a psychological treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy .
however , she believes that a new , increasingly popular course called mindfulness based cognitive therapy -lrb- mbct -rrb- - which primarily consists of meditation - brought about her full recovery .
it is currently available in every county across the uk , and can be prescribed on the nhs .
one of the pioneers of mbct is professor mark williams , from the department of psychiatry at the university of oxford .
he helps to lead group courses which take place over a period of eight weeks .
he describes the approach as 80 % meditation , 20 % cognitive therapy .
new perspective he said : " it teaches a way of looking at problems , observing them clearly but not necessarily trying to fix them or solve them .
" it suggests to people that they begin to see all their thoughts as just thoughts , whether they are positive , negative or neutral . "
mbct is recommended for people who are not currently depressed , but who have had three or more bouts of depression in their lives .
trials suggest that the course reduces the likelihood of another attack of depression by over 50 % .
professor williams believes that more research is still needed .
he said : " it is becoming enormously popular quite quickly and in many ways we now need to collect the evidence to check that it really is being effective . "
however , in the meantime , meditation is being taken seriously as a means of tackling difficult and very modern challenges .
scientists are beginning to investigate how else meditation could be used , particularly for those at risk of suicide and people struggling with the effects of substance abuse .
what is meditation ?
meditation is difficult to define because it has so many different forms .
by meditating , you can become happier , you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that dr richard davidson broadly , it can be described as a mental practice in which you focus your attention on a particular subject or object .
it has historically been associated with religion , but it can also be secular , and exactly what you focus your attention on is largely a matter of personal choice .
it may be a mantra -lrb- repeated word or phrase -rrb- , breathing patterns , or simply an awareness of being alive .
some of the more common forms of meditative practices include buddhist meditation , mindfulness meditation , transcendental meditation , and zen meditation .
the claims made for meditation range from increasing immunity , improving asthma and increasing fertility through to reducing the effects of aging .
limited research research into the health claims made for meditation has limitations and few conclusions can be reached , partly because meditation is rarely isolated - it is often practised alongside other lifestyle changes such as diet , or exercise , or as part of group therapy .
so should we dismiss it as quackery ?
studies from the field of neuroscience suggest not .
it is a new area of research , but indications are intriguing and suggest that meditation may have a measurable impact on the brain .
in boston , massachusetts , dr sara lazar has used a technique called mri scanning to analyse the brains of people who have been meditating for several years .
she compared the brains of these experienced practitioners with people who had never meditated and found that there were differences in the thickness of certain areas of the brain 's cortex , including areas involved in the processing of emotion .
she is continuing research , but she believes that meditation had caused the brain to change physical shape .
buddhist monks in madison , wisconsin , dr richard davidson has been carrying out studies on buddhist monks for several years .
his personal belief is that " by meditating , you can become happier , you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that . "
in one study he observed the brains of a group of office workers before and after they undertook a course of meditation combined with stress reduction techniques .
at the end of the course the participants ' brains seemed to have altered in the way they functioned .
they showed greater activity in the left-hand side - a characteristic which davidson has previously linked to happiness and enthusiasm .
this idea that meditation could improve the wellbeing of everyone , even those not struggling with mental illness , is something that is exciting researchers .
professor williams believes it has huge potential .
" it involves dealing with expectations , with constantly judging ourselves - feeling we 're not good enough , " he said .
" and , that is something which is so widespread in our communities .
" all of these things are just thoughts .
and , they will come up in meditation and learning to recognize what they are as thoughts , and let them go , can be enormously empowering for anybody . "
there is , of course , a distinct possibility that this research will come to nothing and that interest in meditation will turn out to be a passing fad , but for now this ancient discipline is being taken seriously by scientists as a tool with potential to make each one of us happier and more content .
alternative therapies : meditation will be broadcast on monday 31 march 2008 at 2100 gmt on bbc two .

when carol cattley 's husband died it triggered a relapse of the depression which had not plagued her since she was a teenager .

" i could n't think of what else to do . "
carol sought medical help and managed to control her depression with a combination of medication and a psychological treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy .

he describes the approach as 80 % meditation , 20 % cognitive therapy .

" it suggests to people that they begin to see all their thoughts as just thoughts , whether they are positive , negative or neutral . "
mbct is recommended for people who are not currently depressed , but who have had three or more bouts of depression in their lives .

he said : " it is becoming enormously popular quite quickly and in many ways we now need to collect the evidence to check that it really is being effective . "

what is meditation ?
meditation is difficult to define because it has so many different forms .
by meditating , you can become happier , you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that dr richard davidson broadly , it can be described as a mental practice in which you focus your attention on a particular subject or object .
it has historically been associated with religion , but it can also be secular , and exactly what you focus your attention on is largely a matter of personal choice .
it may be a mantra -lrb- repeated word or phrase -rrb- , breathing patterns , or simply an awareness of being alive .
some of the more common forms of meditative practices include buddhist meditation , mindfulness meditation , transcendental meditation , and zen meditation .
the claims made for meditation range from increasing immunity , improving asthma and increasing fertility through to reducing the effects of aging .
limited research research into the health claims made for meditation has limitations and few conclusions can be reached , partly because meditation is rarely isolated - it is often practised alongside other lifestyle changes such as diet , or exercise , or as part of group therapy .
so should we dismiss it as quackery ?
studies from the field of neuroscience suggest not .
it is a new area of research , but indications are intriguing and suggest that meditation may have a measurable impact on the brain .
in boston , massachusetts , dr sara lazar has used a technique called mri scanning to analyse the brains of people who have been meditating for several years .
she compared the brains of these experienced practitioners with people who had never meditated and found that there were differences in the thickness of certain areas of the brain 's cortex , including areas involved in the processing of emotion .
she is continuing research , but she believes that meditation had caused the brain to change physical shape .
buddhist monks in madison , wisconsin , dr richard davidson has been carrying out studies on buddhist monks for several years .
his personal belief is that " by meditating , you can become happier , you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that . "
in one study he observed the brains of a group of office workers before and after they undertook a course of meditation combined with stress reduction techniques .
at the end of the course the participants ' brains seemed to have altered in the way they functioned .
they showed greater activity in the left-hand side - a characteristic which davidson has previously linked to happiness and enthusiasm .
this idea that meditation could improve the wellbeing of everyone , even those not struggling with mental illness , is something that is exciting researchers .
professor williams believes it has huge potential .
" it involves dealing with expectations , with constantly judging ourselves - feeling we 're not good enough , " he said .
" and , that is something which is so widespread in our communities .
" all of these things are just thoughts .
and , they will come up in meditation and learning to recognize what they are as thoughts , and let them go , can be enormously empowering for anybody . "
there is , of course , a distinct possibility that this research will come to nothing and that interest in meditation will turn out to be a passing fad , but for now this ancient discipline is being taken seriously by scientists as a tool with potential to make each one of us happier and more content .

sceptics argue that it is not a practical way to try to deal with the stresses of modern life .
but the long years when adherents were unable to point to hard science to support their belief in the technique may finally be coming to an end .
when carol cattley 's husband died it triggered a relapse of the depression which had not plagued her since she was a teenager .
" i instantly felt as if i wanted to die , " she said .
" i could n't think of what else to do . "
carol sought medical help and managed to control her depression with a combination of medication and a psychological treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy .
however , she believes that a new , increasingly popular course called mindfulness based cognitive therapy -lrb- mbct -rrb- - which primarily consists of meditation - brought about her full recovery .
it is currently available in every county across the uk , and can be prescribed on the nhs .
one of the pioneers of mbct is professor mark williams , from the department of psychiatry at the university of oxford .
he helps to lead group courses which take place over a period of eight weeks .
he describes the approach as 80 % meditation , 20 % cognitive therapy .
new perspective he said : " it teaches a way of looking at problems , observing them clearly but not necessarily trying to fix them or solve them .
" it suggests to people that they begin to see all their thoughts as just thoughts , whether they are positive , negative or neutral . "
mbct is recommended for people who are not currently depressed , but who have had three or more bouts of depression in their lives .
trials suggest that the course reduces the likelihood of another attack of depression by over 50 % .
professor williams believes that more research is still needed .
he said : " it is becoming enormously popular quite quickly and in many ways we now need to collect the evidence to check that it really is being effective . "
however , in the meantime , meditation is being taken seriously as a means of tackling difficult and very modern challenges .
scientists are beginning to investigate how else meditation could be used , particularly for those at risk of suicide and people struggling with the effects of substance abuse .
what is meditation ?
meditation is difficult to define because it has so many different forms .
by meditating , you can become happier , you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that dr richard davidson broadly , it can be described as a mental practice in which you focus your attention on a particular subject or object .
it has historically been associated with religion , but it can also be secular , and exactly what you focus your attention on is largely a matter of personal choice .
it may be a mantra -lrb- repeated word or phrase -rrb- , breathing patterns , or simply an awareness of being alive .
some of the more common forms of meditative practices include buddhist meditation , mindfulness meditation , transcendental meditation , and zen meditation .
the claims made for meditation range from increasing immunity , improving asthma and increasing fertility through to reducing the effects of aging .
limited research research into the health claims made for meditation has limitations and few conclusions can be reached , partly because meditation is rarely isolated - it is often practised alongside other lifestyle changes such as diet , or exercise , or as part of group therapy .
so should we dismiss it as quackery ?
studies from the field of neuroscience suggest not .
it is a new area of research , but indications are intriguing and suggest that meditation may have a measurable impact on the brain .
in boston , massachusetts , dr sara lazar has used a technique called mri scanning to analyse the brains of people who have been meditating for several years .
she compared the brains of these experienced practitioners with people who had never meditated and found that there were differences in the thickness of certain areas of the brain 's cortex , including areas involved in the processing of emotion .
she is continuing research , but she believes that meditation had caused the brain to change physical shape .
buddhist monks in madison , wisconsin , dr richard davidson has been carrying out studies on buddhist monks for several years .
his personal belief is that " by meditating , you can become happier , you can concentrate more effectively and you can change your brain in ways that support that . "
in one study he observed the brains of a group of office workers before and after they undertook a course of meditation combined with stress reduction techniques .
at the end of the course the participants ' brains seemed to have altered in the way they functioned .
they showed greater activity in the left-hand side - a characteristic which davidson has previously linked to happiness and enthusiasm .
this idea that meditation could improve the wellbeing of everyone , even those not struggling with mental illness , is something that is exciting researchers .
professor williams believes it has huge potential .
" it involves dealing with expectations , with constantly judging ourselves - feeling we 're not good enough , " he said .
" and , that is something which is so widespread in our communities .
" all of these things are just thoughts .
and , they will come up in meditation and learning to recognize what they are as thoughts , and let them go , can be enormously empowering for anybody . "
there is , of course , a distinct possibility that this research will come to nothing and that interest in meditation will turn out to be a passing fad , but for now this ancient discipline is being taken seriously by scientists as a tool with potential to make each one of us happier and more content .
