the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.01.2008 strained trade relations between africa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and africa 's trade negotiations are currently on ice the eu wants to forge a series of new trade agreements with africa .
but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.01.2008 strained trade relations between africa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and africa 's trade negotiations are currently on ice the eu wants to forge a series of new trade agreements with africa .
but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .
when merkel 's party called on struck to apologize , he angrily replied : " they can get lost .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .

i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .

working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .

" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.01.2008 speculation grows over blair 's ambitions for eu president role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has his hands full as middle east envoy but does he have an eye on the eu presidency ?
even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .
when merkel 's party called on struck to apologize , he angrily replied : " they can get lost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.01.2008 strained trade relations between africa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and africa 's trade negotiations are currently on ice the eu wants to forge a series of new trade agreements with africa .
but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.01.2008 eu poised to announce controversial climate package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to see more wind , wave and solar power generation the european commission will unveil a controversial climate package this month which will set greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy targets for the coming years . the german press agency dpa is reporting that the latest draft text states that member states will be asked to cut the eu 's overall greenhouse gas emissions by " at least 20 per cent " compared to 1990 levels by 2020 .
environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .
addressing the rights of minorities or the right for people to demonstrate , or questioning the disappearance of journalists or unsolved murders must also remain on the agenda and be discussed . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .

europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .

working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.01.2008 speculation grows over blair 's ambitions for eu president role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has his hands full as middle east envoy but does he have an eye on the eu presidency ?
even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 12.01.2008 youth crime proposals backfiring for merkel 's conservatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted that the gap between the cdu and spd coalition partners has widened controversial plans announced by germany 's conservatives to crack down on youth crime are beginning to have a detrimental effect on chancellor angela merkel 's party , according to opinion polls and merkel herself . two surveys showed that support for the conservatives had dipped , just two weeks before elections take place in the states of hessen and lower saxony , widely regarded as tests of merkel 's popularity before a federal election in 2009 .
the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .
when merkel 's party called on struck to apologize , he angrily replied : " they can get lost .

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.01.2008 strained trade relations between africa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and africa 's trade negotiations are currently on ice the eu wants to forge a series of new trade agreements with africa .
but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .

it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.01.2008 strained trade relations between africa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and africa 's trade negotiations are currently on ice the eu wants to forge a series of new trade agreements with africa .
but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.01.2008 eu poised to announce controversial climate package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to see more wind , wave and solar power generation the european commission will unveil a controversial climate package this month which will set greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy targets for the coming years . the german press agency dpa is reporting that the latest draft text states that member states will be asked to cut the eu 's overall greenhouse gas emissions by " at least 20 per cent " compared to 1990 levels by 2020 .
environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .

but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : kosovo in pursuit of indepedence major eu powers , us recognize kosovo independence kosovo independence : what can the world expect ? us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action serbia , russia move to annul kosovo independence international relations -pipe- 12.01.2008 merkel advisor speaks on german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany held the eu presidency last year dw-tv spoke with christoph heusgen , german chancellor angela merkel 's advisor for foreign policy and security about kosovo , russia and iran . dw-tv : you once said that europe should be a major player in global politics .
that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.01.2008 speculation grows over blair 's ambitions for eu president role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has his hands full as middle east envoy but does he have an eye on the eu presidency ?
even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .

but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .

merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .

the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .
addressing the rights of minorities or the right for people to demonstrate , or questioning the disappearance of journalists or unsolved murders must also remain on the agenda and be discussed . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .

blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .
addressing the rights of minorities or the right for people to demonstrate , or questioning the disappearance of journalists or unsolved murders must also remain on the agenda and be discussed . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.01.2008 speculation grows over blair 's ambitions for eu president role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has his hands full as middle east envoy but does he have an eye on the eu presidency ?
even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .
addressing the rights of minorities or the right for people to demonstrate , or questioning the disappearance of journalists or unsolved murders must also remain on the agenda and be discussed . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.01.2008 speculation grows over blair 's ambitions for eu president role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has his hands full as middle east envoy but does he have an eye on the eu presidency ?
even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .

more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists have already attacked targets of this magnitude , which were agreed by eu leaders meeting last march , as being too lenient .
member states ' individual target levels are still under discussion .
but richer countries will be asked to contribute more than poorer countries , according to the draft text .
" member state reduction efforts should be based on the principle of solidarity between member states and the need for sustainable economic growth across the community , taking into account the relative per capita gdp of member states , " it states .
targets modified according to income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading will be allowed under the draft scheme countries with a relatively low per capita gross domestic product and whose economies are expected to grow would actually be permitted to increase their greenhouse emissions compared to 2005 .
this is the last year for which the latest available verified emission data is available .
more prosperous eu countries would , however , be forced to cut their emissions .
to ensure fairness , the text further states that " no country should be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels . "
but equally the package states that , " no country should be allowed to increase its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to more than 25 per cent above 2005 levels . "
however , an explanatory memorandum to the text puts this figure at 20 per cent instead .
under the plans , countries would be allowed to allowed to buy emission credits from abroad to help meet their targets , or sell their unused quotas .
the package , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states , also stipulates that renewable energy sources must make up a 20-per-cent share of energy consumption and that biofuels should account for at least 10-per-cent of transport fuel by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .

on monday , jan .

this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .

the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .

up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .

the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .

african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .
" the eu is hiding behind the world trade organization 's ruling , " he said .
" in fact , the europeans are trying to assert their own interests . "
he said european companies were waiting in the wings ready at any moment to move into the liberalized african markets .
but most of the states are not prepared for this .
on the other hand , african products are also facing barriers that are not dealt with under the epas .
" cotton products from west africa are competing in the eu with products from southern europe - where the eu is subsidizing the sector 's development , " kohnert said .
and the eu 's chocolate purity regulations is an obstacle to african cocoa producers who would like to switch from exporting cocoa beans to producing chocolate .
another problem of the epa , according to barry , is the loss of important customs income , which could endanger the budgets of african states .
" it is also threatening jobs and the growth of domestic industry , " she said .
african states keeping their options open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's expanding economy is hungry for raw materials but the african states are not going quietly .
many have not signed the epas and others , such as kenya and a number of its neighbors in east africa which have said yes to the eu , are not bound by those agreements , according to oxform .
up to now , the states ' negotiators have only signed the pacts and not their heads of state .
" this means they could pull out at any time , " barry said .
peter mandelson 's opposite number in the african union , trade commissioner elisabeth tankeu , has announced this week that the trade ministers from across the continent are planning to meet before the end of february to decide on a common position vis-a-vis the eu .
transitional arrangements mean that not much has changed for african states since the end of the eu 's preferential trade tariffs .
but it is not clear how long this situation can last .
time is on the africa 's side .
the eu is now facing a number of powerful competitors in the african market , such as china , india and brazil .
these transitional economies see the continent as a useful source of raw materials and have been investing in local industry .
china 's foreign minister yang jiechi has been striking these kind of trade deals on his four-day trip to africa this week .
according to official chinese statistics , trade between china and africa grew more than 30 percent to 50 billion euros in last year alone .
this pressure is having an effect , according to kohnert .
" the eu has decided to put back by one year the deadline for the conclusion of the epa agreements with the africans - this is an option that the europeans firmly ruled out at the outset , " he said .
he believes that the chinese competition in africa could mean that the eu will be forced to negotiate with their african partners on a truly equal footing . ranty islam -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.01.2008 strained trade relations between africa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and africa 's trade negotiations are currently on ice the eu wants to forge a series of new trade agreements with africa .
but the deals foundered at a summit last month .
with anti-pact protests in africa and increasing chinese investment , europe might have to think again . when the senegalese unions ordered people to take to the streets in protest against food and energy prices this week , the target of their ire was , at first glance , their own government alone .
but the unions and the government have a common enemy .
on monday , jan .
7 , members of the government marched alongside the unions to express their opposition to signing an economic partnership agreement -lrb- epa -rrb- with the european union .
this , experts believe , could make the economic situation in the country even more precarious .
that 's set to give eu trade and industry commissioner peter mandelson a considerable headache .
he clearly regards the epas as the best way of placing trade relations with africa on a new footing .
in december , the favorable trade arrangements that the eu had with african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries - most of them former european colonies - ran out .
the world trade organization found that the trade preferences broke world trade rules and ordered the eu to extend them to all poorer countries or roll them back altogether .
eu splitting african states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the senegalese government is opposed to the eu 's trade terms the eu decided to plump for the latter option .
the bloc wants to forge epas with individual african regions .
under the proposals , eu import barriers upon african goods would be lifted .
but in return , african states would be expected to open their markets to eu countries .
this free trade agreement means that the african states would lose the relative advantage that they have enjoyed up to now in european markets .
it 's hardly surprising that the eu-african summit on this topic ended without agreement .
the representatives of most african countries refused to put their signature to the epa deals - first and foremost senegal 's president abdoulaye wade , who categorically rejected them .
the eu has had to face more criticism since then .
after failing to pull off their grand plan , the europeans are now concentrating on trying to sign pacts with individual states which do signal willingness .
the international aid organization oxfam has accused the bloc of exploiting its stronger position to coerce states into agreeing .
worse still , the eu is - the organization says - playing off african states against one another .
what will happen , for example , to the customs union between south africa , an epa opponent , and neighboring botswana , which has signed up ?
" this is ironic given that the eu efforts were supposed to promote the regional integration of african economies , " said oxfam spokeswoman amy barry .
african markets are " not yet ready " for this step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-africa summit in lisbon left many questions unresolved dirk kohnert from the giga institute for african studies in hamburg said the african 's worries are justified .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .
addressing the rights of minorities or the right for people to demonstrate , or questioning the disappearance of journalists or unsolved murders must also remain on the agenda and be discussed . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 12.01.2008 youth crime proposals backfiring for merkel 's conservatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted that the gap between the cdu and spd coalition partners has widened controversial plans announced by germany 's conservatives to crack down on youth crime are beginning to have a detrimental effect on chancellor angela merkel 's party , according to opinion polls and merkel herself . two surveys showed that support for the conservatives had dipped , just two weeks before elections take place in the states of hessen and lower saxony , widely regarded as tests of merkel 's popularity before a federal election in 2009 .
the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .
youth crime plan leads to xenophobia accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's anti-crime drive is taking flak from many sides koch 's proposals to sharpen his law-and-order image ahead of the state poll have angered immigrant groups who accuse him of populism and xenophobia , and politicians from the opposition who claim he is attempting to profit from incidents in which teenage children of immigrants had attacked older germans on public transport .
merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .
" i think roland koch was pleased when this terrible incident took place in munich , " said peter struck , the leader of the spd in parliament .
when merkel 's party called on struck to apologize , he angrily replied : " they can get lost .

even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates . the role , outlined in the treaty signed by the 27 member states at the end of last year , will replace the current system whereby each country assumes the rotating presidency for six months .
the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .

the job , a two-and-a-half-year term , will be up for grabs in 2009 if the bloc 's 27 member states can keep to their timetable and individually ratify the treaty over the next year .
it now appears that former british prime minister tony blair has taken an early lead in the speculative stakes after he jetted into paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy at a meeting of the right-wing union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party in paris on saturday .
while the meeting has no official connection to the blair rumors , some officials are in no doubt what the real reason is for blair 's visit to france .
" i can see something going on with the ump and a french president not averse to tactical maneuvers , and that is to prepare tony blair 's candidature for the european union presidency , " jean-marc ayrault , president of the socialist group in the french parliament said this week .
sarkozy champions blair as eu president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has a lot of respect for what blair achieved in britain sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for blair and was the first and most vocal advocate of his potential presidency .
" he is a very remarkable man .
he is the most european of britons ... it would be intelligent to think of him , " sarkozy said last year .
the french president is not alone in thinking blair would be a good candidate .
" he 's definitely a very dynamic man , with a certain charisma and energy .
he 's not a bad leader at all , he has achieved a lot during his -lrb- britain 's eu -rrb- presidency in 2005 with the agreement on the eu budget until 2013 .
i have nothing against him , " said one eu commissioner .
blair 's supporters also trumpet his close ties with the united states , which could help improve transatlantic relations , and his high international profile .
the former premier certainly has the credentials to tackle what will be a very demanding role .
the eu president 's post , which will be renewable once for any incumbent , is aimed at providing a personal face for the sometimes faceless european institutions .
one of blair 's strongest skills is his public persona and his ability to work with diplomats of all levels and nations .
the european president would also have to be a strong character to help define the job from that of the eu " high representative " for foreign affairs , a post also introduced in the treaty , and the european commission president 's role .
blair has never had a problem with showing those around him who 's boss , with maybe the exception of the president of the united states .
opponents with long memories however , while he has many supporters , he has an equal amount of detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is accused of turning his back on the eu at times " britain 's exclusion of the common currency is a considerable blockage for him , " andrew duff , british liberal mep and specialist on institutional questions , told afp .
" i suspect blair is excluded from the list , it is n't a realistic option .
it would be a mistake to pick an ex-pm of a large member state because the balance of power between big and small member states is a sensitive question . "
blair has shown himself to be an advocate for the primacy of nation states which may fly in the face of the european idea of federalism , a standpoint supported by another front-runner luxembourg premier 's jean-claude juncker .
for others , britain 's " semi-detached " attitude to europe could also count against blair .
as well as not adopting the euro , britain has remained outside europe 's border-free schengen zone and it secured key policy opt-outs in the same treaty that creates the president 's position .
transatlantic relationship urks some jilted europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair was criticized in the eu for his choice of partner blair 's close relationship with the united states , which his supporters say would be advantageous in the european president 's post , is also held up by those against him as a reason why he would not be the ideal candidate .
blair looked across the atlantic instead of the english channel when iraq slipped towards war and many on the continent have not forgotten on which post blair nailed his colors .
while speculation grows , the man himself is said to be concentrating fully on his current job as the international community 's middle east envoy without a thought for the position of european president .
anyone who has followed blair 's career will find that very difficult to believe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the infratest-dimap and forsa surveys both showed merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , dropping single points .
infratest stated that the conservatives were down one point at 39 percent while backing for their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- rivals was up two points at 30 percent .
forsa also showed a one point decrease in popularity , putting the conservatives on a standing of 37 percent compared to a one-point gain for the spd , whose support had been dwindling for months .
some observers claimed that the dip was an initial reaction to the plans put forward by hessen premier roland koch and that it was unlikely to have a long-term effect of the campaigns of koch and fellow cdu incumbent christian wulff in lower saxony .
others said that the surveys signalled a potential defeat in each state election for the conservatives .
merkel admits coalition is badly split meanwhile chancellor merkel admitted in an interview with the die welt newspaper published on saturday that germany 's ruling coalition was split over proposals by her party to crack down on juvenile offenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young offenders face more jail time under the new plans " the issue has caused a massive clash between the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union and the social democrats , " merkel said , adding that while parties believed there was a need to get tough with young criminals , the cdu wanted new legal tools to do so in contrast to the spd which believed existing laws were sufficient .
" the cdu believes that apart from consistently implementing the existing measures , we also need tougher laws on some points .
the spd says ' no ' , this is not necessary , " she said .
merkel has backed the plans by koch , which include boot camps and short periods of detention for young offenders , faster deportation procedures for foreign perpetrators and harder sentences for young criminals .
" i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lrb- short periods in detention -rrb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " she said .

merkel , who has in recent months tried to steer her party to the political centre , has rejected the accusations as " absurd " .
in the die welt interview , she stood firm on the need to take youth offenders in hand .
" we must look at the needs of society as a whole and can not allow a minority of german or foreign youths to infringe on our freedom - the freedom to go to the theatre or cinema or to visit friends after nightfall . "
the row took a nasty turn on friday when the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , peter struck , attacked koch .

that could very likely happen soon with regard to kosovo .
when will kosovo be recognized ? christoph heusgen : the european union has long been a player in global politics , particularly in the balkans , during the crisis in 1999 , when europe despaired over kosovo and failed in its role - and has remained active since then .
we have the eu to thank for the stability we see there compared to the situation in the 1990s .
slovenia is now an eu-member ; croatia is presently in membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph heusgen is one of merkel 's closest advisors we have also been able to forge closer relations between the other balkan states and the european union .
europe is like a rock that provides stability for the balkans .
and kosovo is now the last problem remaining of the former yugoslavia which we must solve .
i 'm sure that we can resolve the question of kosovo 's status in the coming weeks and months . that means that you do not anticipate a speedy recognition of kosovo as an independent state ? we must first wait and see how the government emerges in kosovo , how further negotiations that are necessary will develop , and most importantly , we in the eu must make sure that we take the amicable approach in the kosovo question that we have taken in all the other issues concerning the balkans so far .
that is also chancellor merkel 's aim . nonetheless , it seems that the recognition of kosovo as an independent state is meanwhile inevitable , even necessary .
do you anticipate unrest in the province when kosovars declare independence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 compared to the 1990s , we have , i believe , been able to achieve that the debates on the issue - which are ongoing - occur with peaceful means .
even last year , when discussions revolved around bosnia and herzegovina , they were addressed on a political level , and not one based on violence .
we were able to achieve that and i am confident that we will be able to maintain such an approach when it comes to resolving the issue of kosovo 's status . turning to other issues , why is chancellor merkel so interested in iran and so clear about her policy of wanting sanctions against the country if it refuses to give up its nuclear program ? human rights are a central issue concerning iran , but there is another important reason for chancellor merkel 's concern about the country : iran , or rather president mahmoud ahmadinejad , has questioned the existence of israel like no other politician since world war ii .
it is abundantly clear that german politicians will do everything in their power to prevent any of ahmadinejad 's plans regarding israel from becoming reality .
i think it is incredibly important that we are absolutely clear when dealing with iran , and that we clearly state what we think of the iranian president 's comments about israel , and that we thwart any attempts by iran to obtain nuclear weapons . the european union 's biggest , most important neighbor is surely russia .
elections will be held there in march .
there will be a new president , but he will most likely continue on with the same policies of the current president .
in strategic terms , just how important is collaborating with russia ? working together with russia is very important , and will remain so , regardless of whether putin maintains a central role as prime minister , or whether medvedev is president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas pipeline that is part of the german-russian achimgaz joint venture it is key that germany has good relations with russia ; it is also important for the european union .
let me give you two or three examples as to why : if we want to achieve peace in the middle east - which has also been an area where chancellor has been very active - we can only do that with russia .
working with iran , or rather , maintaining a joint position toward iran and its nuclear program - that is also only possible with russia .
russia is on the united nations security council and we must and we do make efforts with russia to come to joint positions , which are then approved by the security council .
also , it is essential to cooperate with russia because of many other difficult international issues which remain unresolved .
in addition , as you well know , we are dependent on russian gas and crude oil for our energy supply .
so , it is in our own interests to keep and expand good relations with russia , which does not mean that one refrains from posing critical questions or avoids problematic issues .
addressing the rights of minorities or the right for people to demonstrate , or questioning the disappearance of journalists or unsolved murders must also remain on the agenda and be discussed . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of baptisms of children aged between one and 13 has risen by almost a quarter since 1958 , according to the pastoral research centre trust .
the researchers say " lapsed " catholics are behind the rise in late baptisms .
the study also suggests 64 % of babies aged under one were baptised in 2005 , compared to 85 % in 1958 .
the trust 's tony spencer said that a lapse in religious discipline meant some parents were having their children baptised between the ages of two and three after realising it would help them gain a place at an oversubscribed catholic school .
' good thing ' " it is a great compliment from the community at large to the quality of the catholic school system , " mr spencer said .
the trust added that the falling infant mortality rate has also meant parents are less concerned about having their children baptised .
oona stannard , director of the catholic education service for england and wales , said it was reassuring that people sought baptism for their children , regardless of age .
" that the child is brought into the church and the family 's bond with the church strengthened can only but be a good thing , irrespective of whether the child does eventually have the benefit of attending a catholic school , " she said .
a spokeswoman for the department for children , schools and families said : " as ed balls made clear only this week , it is for local communities to determine the types of schools that they want .
" all schools are bound by our new admissions code which stipulates fair admissions policy for all schools .
schools are under a legal duty to promote community cohesion , understanding and tolerance . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i would love to send my daughter and son to a catholic secondary school in burgess hill , which is performing well in league tables and is an excellent school .
however i am probably not going to be able to do this as , although my children and myself and my husband are all baptised , we are church of england , and we regularly attend the local village church which we all love .
i am in a dilemma in that if i put her name down as first choice for this school , i will probably be discriminated against as we are not catholic and she will not be offered a place - however my friend who is catholic will get her daughter in , as i believe this school will only take catholics first and it is well oversubscribed .
carolyn james , west sussex while only being involved in the school system as a grandparent i must stress that it takes much more than being baptised to get into a catholic school -lrb- especially a secondary school -rrb- the parents have to be able to demonstrate that they are practising catholics and involved with their local church community .
i have one grandson at secondary school and two more due to start next september and , despite the parents having always being heavily involved with their local churches , there is no guarantee that either of them will get a place .
also , i must say that the parish priests are fully aware of the parents who suddenly become very active in their parishes when school application forms are due ! !
val neary , purley , uk it is true that parents who do not attend church for years try and get their children baptised to gain entry to catholic schools often claiming the child has expressed a wish / interest in the faith when they are ten .
as a priest i will not baptise and child over 7 unless they are attending mass regularly and a first holy communion programme which runs for 6 months .

the number of baptisms of children aged between one and 13 has risen by almost a quarter since 1958 , according to the pastoral research centre trust .

the study also suggests 64 % of babies aged under one were baptised in 2005 , compared to 85 % in 1958 .

' good thing ' " it is a great compliment from the community at large to the quality of the catholic school system , " mr spencer said .

" that the child is brought into the church and the family 's bond with the church strengthened can only but be a good thing , irrespective of whether the child does eventually have the benefit of attending a catholic school , " she said .

the number of baptisms of children aged between one and 13 has risen by almost a quarter since 1958 , according to the pastoral research centre trust .
the researchers say " lapsed " catholics are behind the rise in late baptisms .
the study also suggests 64 % of babies aged under one were baptised in 2005 , compared to 85 % in 1958 .
the trust 's tony spencer said that a lapse in religious discipline meant some parents were having their children baptised between the ages of two and three after realising it would help them gain a place at an oversubscribed catholic school .
' good thing ' " it is a great compliment from the community at large to the quality of the catholic school system , " mr spencer said .
the trust added that the falling infant mortality rate has also meant parents are less concerned about having their children baptised .
oona stannard , director of the catholic education service for england and wales , said it was reassuring that people sought baptism for their children , regardless of age .
" that the child is brought into the church and the family 's bond with the church strengthened can only but be a good thing , irrespective of whether the child does eventually have the benefit of attending a catholic school , " she said .
a spokeswoman for the department for children , schools and families said : " as ed balls made clear only this week , it is for local communities to determine the types of schools that they want .
" all schools are bound by our new admissions code which stipulates fair admissions policy for all schools .
schools are under a legal duty to promote community cohesion , understanding and tolerance . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i would love to send my daughter and son to a catholic secondary school in burgess hill , which is performing well in league tables and is an excellent school .
however i am probably not going to be able to do this as , although my children and myself and my husband are all baptised , we are church of england , and we regularly attend the local village church which we all love .
i am in a dilemma in that if i put her name down as first choice for this school , i will probably be discriminated against as we are not catholic and she will not be offered a place - however my friend who is catholic will get her daughter in , as i believe this school will only take catholics first and it is well oversubscribed .
carolyn james , west sussex while only being involved in the school system as a grandparent i must stress that it takes much more than being baptised to get into a catholic school -lrb- especially a secondary school -rrb- the parents have to be able to demonstrate that they are practising catholics and involved with their local church community .
i have one grandson at secondary school and two more due to start next september and , despite the parents having always being heavily involved with their local churches , there is no guarantee that either of them will get a place .
also , i must say that the parish priests are fully aware of the parents who suddenly become very active in their parishes when school application forms are due ! !
val neary , purley , uk it is true that parents who do not attend church for years try and get their children baptised to gain entry to catholic schools often claiming the child has expressed a wish / interest in the faith when they are ten .
as a priest i will not baptise and child over 7 unless they are attending mass regularly and a first holy communion programme which runs for 6 months .
this seems to separate those who are genuine and those only looking for access to the schools .
catholic parishes pay a great deal into central funds to maintain these schools and it is not right that those who attend mass every week should be expected to subsidise those families who do nothing for the life of the church .
it is unfortunate that baptism is now the only criteria used in determining the faith qualification for school admission .
it means that those who support the life of the church both with their personal commitment as well as financially get no preference over someone who has been baptised 11 years ago and not been inside a church since .
keith miles , gloucester my sister -lrb- atheist - ex-protestant -rrb- and her husband -lrb- atheist - ex muslim -rrb- got my nephew baptised so he could go to the local c of e primary school .
it worked !
it has nothing to do with a bond between church and family .
it 's all about making sure your kids do n't go to the underachieving ghetto school next door .
roger , london every non-religious person , myself included , is affected by religious schools , because they are forced to pay for them through the tax system even though they are actively discriminated against in terms of entry .
one only has to look at the admissions policy for religious schools and they make clear that religious people get priority and the non-religious are only welcome if they are prepared to tolerate the ethos of discrimination ..
keith charters , glasgow , scotland i am a catholic high school chaplain .
a primary reason for this change is simply that the church makes clear that the unbaptised child is not destined for hell , unlike popular belief in past times .
as a result , baptisms often happen at a more relaxed pace nowadays , when a child is a year old or more .
also , the church is beginning to serve its young people far better , so some youngsters now are making the decision to be baptised themselves .
as for baptism just for the sake of going to a catholic school , it 's just not that simple .
the code of cannon law states that , for a child to be baptised , " there must be a founded hope that the infant will be brought up in the catholic religion " .
this usually means that at least one parent must be at least basically practising the catholic faith , and priests are required to prepare parents and child appropriately .
it is this careful attitude to life and faith that is at the heart of the success of catholic schools .
to say later baptisms have increased just because people want to get their child into school is not correct , and is at least a vast over-simplification .
simon bg , wakefield it is a national disgrace that in the twenty-first century access to state education can be determined by the professed religious beliefs of a child 's parents .
moreover , ample evidence exists -lrb- ask ofsted -rrb- to support the allegation that parents baptize their children for no other reason than to gain admission to a church supported school because they perform better academically , and that this stems from simple selection - not god .

the study also suggests 64 % of babies aged under one were baptised in 2005 , compared to 85 % in 1958 .

the number of baptisms of children aged between one and 13 has risen by almost a quarter since 1958 , according to the pastoral research centre trust .
the researchers say " lapsed " catholics are behind the rise in late baptisms .
the study also suggests 64 % of babies aged under one were baptised in 2005 , compared to 85 % in 1958 .
the trust 's tony spencer said that a lapse in religious discipline meant some parents were having their children baptised between the ages of two and three after realising it would help them gain a place at an oversubscribed catholic school .
' good thing ' " it is a great compliment from the community at large to the quality of the catholic school system , " mr spencer said .
the trust added that the falling infant mortality rate has also meant parents are less concerned about having their children baptised .
oona stannard , director of the catholic education service for england and wales , said it was reassuring that people sought baptism for their children , regardless of age .
" that the child is brought into the church and the family 's bond with the church strengthened can only but be a good thing , irrespective of whether the child does eventually have the benefit of attending a catholic school , " she said .
a spokeswoman for the department for children , schools and families said : " as ed balls made clear only this week , it is for local communities to determine the types of schools that they want .
" all schools are bound by our new admissions code which stipulates fair admissions policy for all schools .
schools are under a legal duty to promote community cohesion , understanding and tolerance . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i would love to send my daughter and son to a catholic secondary school in burgess hill , which is performing well in league tables and is an excellent school .
however i am probably not going to be able to do this as , although my children and myself and my husband are all baptised , we are church of england , and we regularly attend the local village church which we all love .
i am in a dilemma in that if i put her name down as first choice for this school , i will probably be discriminated against as we are not catholic and she will not be offered a place - however my friend who is catholic will get her daughter in , as i believe this school will only take catholics first and it is well oversubscribed .
carolyn james , west sussex while only being involved in the school system as a grandparent i must stress that it takes much more than being baptised to get into a catholic school -lrb- especially a secondary school -rrb- the parents have to be able to demonstrate that they are practising catholics and involved with their local church community .
i have one grandson at secondary school and two more due to start next september and , despite the parents having always being heavily involved with their local churches , there is no guarantee that either of them will get a place .
also , i must say that the parish priests are fully aware of the parents who suddenly become very active in their parishes when school application forms are due ! !
val neary , purley , uk it is true that parents who do not attend church for years try and get their children baptised to gain entry to catholic schools often claiming the child has expressed a wish / interest in the faith when they are ten .
as a priest i will not baptise and child over 7 unless they are attending mass regularly and a first holy communion programme which runs for 6 months .
this seems to separate those who are genuine and those only looking for access to the schools .
catholic parishes pay a great deal into central funds to maintain these schools and it is not right that those who attend mass every week should be expected to subsidise those families who do nothing for the life of the church .
it is unfortunate that baptism is now the only criteria used in determining the faith qualification for school admission .
it means that those who support the life of the church both with their personal commitment as well as financially get no preference over someone who has been baptised 11 years ago and not been inside a church since .
keith miles , gloucester my sister -lrb- atheist - ex-protestant -rrb- and her husband -lrb- atheist - ex muslim -rrb- got my nephew baptised so he could go to the local c of e primary school .
it worked !

it 's all about making sure your kids do n't go to the underachieving ghetto school next door .
roger , london every non-religious person , myself included , is affected by religious schools , because they are forced to pay for them through the tax system even though they are actively discriminated against in terms of entry .
one only has to look at the admissions policy for religious schools and they make clear that religious people get priority and the non-religious are only welcome if they are prepared to tolerate the ethos of discrimination ..
keith charters , glasgow , scotland i am a catholic high school chaplain .
a primary reason for this change is simply that the church makes clear that the unbaptised child is not destined for hell , unlike popular belief in past times .
as a result , baptisms often happen at a more relaxed pace nowadays , when a child is a year old or more .
also , the church is beginning to serve its young people far better , so some youngsters now are making the decision to be baptised themselves .
as for baptism just for the sake of going to a catholic school , it 's just not that simple .
the code of cannon law states that , for a child to be baptised , " there must be a founded hope that the infant will be brought up in the catholic religion " .
this usually means that at least one parent must be at least basically practising the catholic faith , and priests are required to prepare parents and child appropriately .
it is this careful attitude to life and faith that is at the heart of the success of catholic schools .
to say later baptisms have increased just because people want to get their child into school is not correct , and is at least a vast over-simplification .
simon bg , wakefield it is a national disgrace that in the twenty-first century access to state education can be determined by the professed religious beliefs of a child 's parents .

nicola clapton , hackney , london rather than being " . . . a great compliment from the community at large to the quality of the catholic school system , " as mr spencer says , i think it is rather a damning indictment of the state school system .

the survey for the ministry of justice -lrb- moj -rrb- , which dates from 2004 but has only just been published , says 57 % believe the law is being exploited .
the poll of 2,000 people featured in a report which found there was widespread support for a law on human rights .
the moj said ministers had been working to improve understanding of the act .
a spokesman said : " the overwhelming conclusion shows 84 % of the general public agree it is important to have a law which deals with human rights in britain .
" since this research was undertaken , the government has undertaken a campaign to promote better understanding of the act and to ensure that public authorities are more aware of their duties to the public under the act . "
the government commissioned the human rights insight project in 2004 , but the moj has only now released the findings .
lawyers and celebrities the 1998 act , which came fully into force in 2000 , includes the right to life , the right to privacy and family life and the right to freedom of religion .
it incorporates articles two to 12 and article 14 of the european convention on human rights into british law .
the study , released now without publicity , suggests that british people feel values of respect , dignity , equality and fairness are very important .
but a majority said the act was being misapplied , particularly by certain groups , including refugees , lawyers and celebrities .
overall , 40 % of those questioned said the law created more problems than it solved .
the report recommends that government develop a " communications strategy " to try to win the public over .
but the document states that the research was commissioned to " stimulate discussion " and does not represent government policy .
it called for more work to correct public misunderstandings about the hra .

shopkeepers in llanberis at the foot of snowdon , say tourists only see the larger edge-of-village attractions because of a lack of proper road signs .
every year thousands of people visit the area to climb snowdon .
gwynedd council said it was trying to improve the " look " of llanberis village and new signs were being erected .
deryl jones , from the snowdon honey farm and winery , said redirecting visitors would help the situation .
" when i researched the market in 2003 , before opening my shop , wales tourist board figures suggested around 350,000 people went up snowdon every year , but by my reckoning only around 35,000 of those came into the village centre , " he said .
" what i 'd like to see is a new car park on the edge of the lake and then a route which would take visitors through the village centre on their way to the mountain . "
dylan jones who runs crib goch crafts said : " i spoke to people who had been coming to the area for six years and never realised there were shops here until they asked someone for the nearest chemist . "
jean roberts , 64 , and eirlys lee , 70 , both from llanberis said there had been a decline in the number of shops in the village over the years .
" the bypass was built around 20-years-ago , which really affected trade , " said mrs roberts .
" i lived away for around 50 years and was really surprised by the change when i came back here six years ago , " said mrs lee .
linzi payge from northampton said she was a frequent visitor to the area . "
it 's a nice little village but they could list what is available on the signs " koreen perkins , resident " i love llanberis but it 's not selling itself well , " she said .
" we came here at christmas expecting it to be quaint , but there were no lights or anything .
" you walk along the high street and it looks as if everyone is asleep , with shops closed .
" it could be so much more vibrant , " she added .
a spokesman for gwynedd county council said llanberis was recognised as a key location in the area .
work had also been done to improve the " look " of the village with new street signs " drawing attention to local attractions , " he said .
