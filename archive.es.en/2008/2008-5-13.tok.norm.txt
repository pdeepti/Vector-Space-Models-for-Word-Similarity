currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the thw , germany 's volunteer disaster relief agency , voiced confidence the team would be allowed in by the burmese military government , saying the authorities were " evidently opening the borders . "
a 12-person ready-reaction team , a transport specialist and a german diplomat were on a regular flight to rangoon via bangkok , and the water-treatment machinery was waiting on the ground in the frankfurt area to leave by air on tuesday evening for asia .
the team , expected to arrive in rangoon late tuesday , has been assigned to pick six sites for mobile plants which would begin to arrive by air cargo on wednesday .
four of the plants can turn out 6,000 liters of drinkable water per hour .
the thw is funded by the german interior ministry and specializes in bringing food , water and infrastructure to disaster zones . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .

its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany could help russia to modernize once the country had become economically stabile , he said in a speech on tuesday , may 13 , in yekaterinburg in the ural mountains . russia remains an " indispensable partner , also in shaping the political world of tomorrow , " steinmeier said , referring to comments newly elected president dmitry medvedev has made regarding the need for reforms to improve the rule of law , modernizing state bureaucracy and freedoms for civil society and entrepreneurs . he said that russia and the eu needed each other when it came to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection .
quick deal steinmeier also pressed for speedy negotiations on a new eu partnership treaty with russia , since the final barriers to internal bloc agreement had been overcome .
he said the path had been cleared for the new pact , which was meant to cover trade and political partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- meets with his russian counterpart tuesday " i hope it will not only be a new , modern treaty between russia and the eu but that it will , above all , be negotiated within a clear timeframe , so that it can become the basis of our common policy , " he said . lithuania said sunday it was abandoning its objection to the pact between the european union and russia .
but the eu newcomer and former soviet republic said its approval was contingent on russia resuming oil deliveries as well as solutions to the frozen conflicts in moldova and georgia . the previous 10-year pact between the eu and russia expired last year .
rare upfrontness germany 's top diplomat was unusually upfront about democracy in russia and called on the kremlin to provide reliable conditions for investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev -lrb- r . -rrb- got putin 's job last week " the modernization of russia can only succeed if domestic and foreign capital face a reliable legal framework , " he said , adding that positive economic development required trust , reliable processes and an independent judiciary . " these are all issues we are already working on with a view on russia 's future -lsb- world trade organization -rsb- membership , " he said . steinmeier , who is also deputy chancellor , is scheduled to hold talks with his russian counterpart , sergey lavrov , later tuesday .
he is the first western minister to visit russia since medvedev was inaugurated last week .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany could help russia to modernize once the country had become economically stabile , he said in a speech on tuesday , may 13 , in yekaterinburg in the ural mountains . russia remains an " indispensable partner , also in shaping the political world of tomorrow , " steinmeier said , referring to comments newly elected president dmitry medvedev has made regarding the need for reforms to improve the rule of law , modernizing state bureaucracy and freedoms for civil society and entrepreneurs . he said that russia and the eu needed each other when it came to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda .

if tadic manages to woo socialist leader ivica dacic to his side , the moderate bloc , which won almost 39 percent of the vote , would be able to form a fraught majority . socialists are kingmaker but if milosevic 's successors side with the hard-line radical party , serbia 's nationalists will have 127 seats in the 250-seat parliament - just enough to govern . the radical party led by tomislav nikolic , came second in sunday 's elections with 29.2 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's radical party leader tomislav nikolic , will also be wooing the socialists so far , dacic has not committed the socialists to either side , saying only that the party could work with any partner interested in " territorial integrity and social justice . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda .

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " the future path of the country is now largely in the hands of the socialist party , which was founded and once led by former dictator slobodan milosevic .
the socialists secured 20 seats in the election .
if tadic manages to woo socialist leader ivica dacic to his side , the moderate bloc , which won almost 39 percent of the vote , would be able to form a fraught majority . socialists are kingmaker but if milosevic 's successors side with the hard-line radical party , serbia 's nationalists will have 127 seats in the 250-seat parliament - just enough to govern . the radical party led by tomislav nikolic , came second in sunday 's elections with 29.2 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's radical party leader tomislav nikolic , will also be wooing the socialists so far , dacic has not committed the socialists to either side , saying only that the party could work with any partner interested in " territorial integrity and social justice . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . " the european union would give such a government all its support .

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany could help russia to modernize once the country had become economically stabile , he said in a speech on tuesday , may 13 , in yekaterinburg in the ural mountains . russia remains an " indispensable partner , also in shaping the political world of tomorrow , " steinmeier said , referring to comments newly elected president dmitry medvedev has made regarding the need for reforms to improve the rule of law , modernizing state bureaucracy and freedoms for civil society and entrepreneurs . he said that russia and the eu needed each other when it came to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection .
quick deal steinmeier also pressed for speedy negotiations on a new eu partnership treaty with russia , since the final barriers to internal bloc agreement had been overcome .
he said the path had been cleared for the new pact , which was meant to cover trade and political partnership .

but the eu newcomer and former soviet republic said its approval was contingent on russia resuming oil deliveries as well as solutions to the frozen conflicts in moldova and georgia . the previous 10-year pact between the eu and russia expired last year .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany could help russia to modernize once the country had become economically stabile , he said in a speech on tuesday , may 13 , in yekaterinburg in the ural mountains . russia remains an " indispensable partner , also in shaping the political world of tomorrow , " steinmeier said , referring to comments newly elected president dmitry medvedev has made regarding the need for reforms to improve the rule of law , modernizing state bureaucracy and freedoms for civil society and entrepreneurs . he said that russia and the eu needed each other when it came to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection .
quick deal steinmeier also pressed for speedy negotiations on a new eu partnership treaty with russia , since the final barriers to internal bloc agreement had been overcome .
he said the path had been cleared for the new pact , which was meant to cover trade and political partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- meets with his russian counterpart tuesday " i hope it will not only be a new , modern treaty between russia and the eu but that it will , above all , be negotiated within a clear timeframe , so that it can become the basis of our common policy , " he said . lithuania said sunday it was abandoning its objection to the pact between the european union and russia .
but the eu newcomer and former soviet republic said its approval was contingent on russia resuming oil deliveries as well as solutions to the frozen conflicts in moldova and georgia . the previous 10-year pact between the eu and russia expired last year .
rare upfrontness germany 's top diplomat was unusually upfront about democracy in russia and called on the kremlin to provide reliable conditions for investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev -lrb- r . -rrb- got putin 's job last week " the modernization of russia can only succeed if domestic and foreign capital face a reliable legal framework , " he said , adding that positive economic development required trust , reliable processes and an independent judiciary . " these are all issues we are already working on with a view on russia 's future -lsb- world trade organization -rsb- membership , " he said . steinmeier , who is also deputy chancellor , is scheduled to hold talks with his russian counterpart , sergey lavrov , later tuesday .
he is the first western minister to visit russia since medvedev was inaugurated last week .

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " the future path of the country is now largely in the hands of the socialist party , which was founded and once led by former dictator slobodan milosevic .
the socialists secured 20 seats in the election .
if tadic manages to woo socialist leader ivica dacic to his side , the moderate bloc , which won almost 39 percent of the vote , would be able to form a fraught majority . socialists are kingmaker but if milosevic 's successors side with the hard-line radical party , serbia 's nationalists will have 127 seats in the 250-seat parliament - just enough to govern . the radical party led by tomislav nikolic , came second in sunday 's elections with 29.2 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's radical party leader tomislav nikolic , will also be wooing the socialists so far , dacic has not committed the socialists to either side , saying only that the party could work with any partner interested in " territorial integrity and social justice . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement .

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " the future path of the country is now largely in the hands of the socialist party , which was founded and once led by former dictator slobodan milosevic .
the socialists secured 20 seats in the election .
if tadic manages to woo socialist leader ivica dacic to his side , the moderate bloc , which won almost 39 percent of the vote , would be able to form a fraught majority . socialists are kingmaker but if milosevic 's successors side with the hard-line radical party , serbia 's nationalists will have 127 seats in the 250-seat parliament - just enough to govern . the radical party led by tomislav nikolic , came second in sunday 's elections with 29.2 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's radical party leader tomislav nikolic , will also be wooing the socialists so far , dacic has not committed the socialists to either side , saying only that the party could work with any partner interested in " territorial integrity and social justice . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

institutional investors were offered options tuesday on government-owned shares in deutsche telekom , the telecommunications giant which remains one-third controlled by the german federal government . investors pitching in for a 3.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- credit to federal bank kfw would gain the choice of repayment in money or in about 5 percent of telekom 's overall stock in 2013 . telekom , formerly a government departure , began its privatization 12 years ago , briefly ballooned in value during the late 1990s technology boom and then fell back .
its shares have been flat since . tuesday 's announcement by kfw of a convertible-bond issue sent the stock 1.5 percent lower to 11.76 euros as existing owners worried about a glut of the stock .
currently kfw and the federal government own 32 percent of the multinational company . the move appeared aimed to reassuring markets that berlin wants to privatize all of telekom when the price is right . a kfw spokesman said the bank did not anticipate any long-term negative effect on the share price . convertible bonds do not always lead to a transfer of shares . in 2003 , kfw issued 5.0 billion euros in bonds and is expected to repay this august in cash , since the 6.5 per cent of telekom stock offered as collateral is likely to be worth far less than the conversion price of 17.526 euros per share . this week 's bonds are not available to private or us investors , but will be tradable as securities after the issue . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " the future path of the country is now largely in the hands of the socialist party , which was founded and once led by former dictator slobodan milosevic .
the socialists secured 20 seats in the election .
if tadic manages to woo socialist leader ivica dacic to his side , the moderate bloc , which won almost 39 percent of the vote , would be able to form a fraught majority . socialists are kingmaker but if milosevic 's successors side with the hard-line radical party , serbia 's nationalists will have 127 seats in the 250-seat parliament - just enough to govern . the radical party led by tomislav nikolic , came second in sunday 's elections with 29.2 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's radical party leader tomislav nikolic , will also be wooing the socialists so far , dacic has not committed the socialists to either side , saying only that the party could work with any partner interested in " territorial integrity and social justice . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement .

" as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement .

" unofficial and informal mutterings " were more " an element of the negotiations than a serious standpoint , " tusk was quoted by the polish press agency as saying in warsaw .
washington was pushing for an end to the political negotiations by mid-july , gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday .
warsaw should send a signal before the summer holidays that the missile-defence shield would be set up in poland , the newspaper report said , citing sources close to the negotiations .
if poland was n't prepared to host the missiles , the united states would have to find another location for them , the report said .
the polish standpoint remained unchanged , tusk said ahead of a trip to latin america .
" if conditions arise that correspond to the needs of the polish army , then there will also be a missile shield , " tusk said .
currently the us proposals were under the threshold that poland would consider satisfactory , tusk said .
four groups of polish and us officials were convened one week ago to look into matters such as the equipment needs of the polish army .
at the beginning of the year , the us congress approved $ 27 million -lrb- 17.5 million euros -rrb- for poland , and us president george w bush recently announced a further $ 20 million .
the us would like to station 10 anti-ballistic missiles in poland and set up a radar station in the czech republic to prevent attacks from what washington calls " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
warsaw has made its cooperation in the project contingent on military assistance from the us , primarily in the modernization of its air defences .
poland estimates that it needs some $ 20 million to upgrade its military equipment . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the outcome of the talks remains uncertain . while the parliamentary elections on the weekend gave a big boost to the pro-european parties led by tadic , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . that would be a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing the election on sunday , may 11 , and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " the future path of the country is now largely in the hands of the socialist party , which was founded and once led by former dictator slobodan milosevic .
the socialists secured 20 seats in the election .
if tadic manages to woo socialist leader ivica dacic to his side , the moderate bloc , which won almost 39 percent of the vote , would be able to form a fraught majority . socialists are kingmaker but if milosevic 's successors side with the hard-line radical party , serbia 's nationalists will have 127 seats in the 250-seat parliament - just enough to govern . the radical party led by tomislav nikolic , came second in sunday 's elections with 29.2 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's radical party leader tomislav nikolic , will also be wooing the socialists so far , dacic has not committed the socialists to either side , saying only that the party could work with any partner interested in " territorial integrity and social justice . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high . for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 -lrb- 323 euros -rrb- a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest at western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . long , uncertain summer ahead already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , told german news agency dpa .
" we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority . " under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . the eu was quick to hail the moderates ' victory on sunday , but as the main players now scramble to form a coalition , it is sounding a more cautious note . " i hope that a new government can be formed rapidly , which would be strongly committed to reforms and to meeting the necessary conditions for further progress towards europe , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . " the european union would give such a government all its support .

the researchers found that peer pressure also had an impact on youngsters ' healthy eating .
they say the findings highlight the need for schools to put policies in place to back up healthy eating .
but the national association of head teachers -lrb- naht -rrb- said they do not back schemes imposing solutions on pupils .
in a year-long study , researchers from the cardiff institute of society , health and ethics looked at the snacking habits of nine to 11 year-olds at 43 primary schools in deprived areas of south wales and south west england .
limited impact twenty three schools were asked to start fruit tuck shops selling a variety of fruit at a fixed price and not to sell sweets and crisps .
all the schools continued with their existing policies on bringing food into school .
over the year-long study which was funded by the food standards agency , the tuck shops sold about 70,000 pieces of fruit - or 0.06 pieces of fruit per student per day .
at the end of the year the children were surveyed on how much fruit and other snacks they had eaten the day before .
they were also asked how much fruit they and their friends regularly ate at school .
the research found that fruit tuck shops alone had a limited impact on how much fruit children ate at school .
however , they had a much greater impact on schools which also had a " no food " or " fruit only policy " .
children who attended fruit tuck shops where fruit was the only food allowed in school ate 0.37 more portions of fruit per day than those at schools without a fruit tuck shop .
pupils at schools which banned all types of food ate 0.14 more portions of fruit per day , the research found .
where there were no restrictions on food being brought into school , fruit consumption was lower than at other schools , even if the school had a fruit tuck shop .
professor laurence moore , from the cardiff institute , said : " our results suggest that children are more willing to use fruit tuck shops and eat fruit as a snack at school if they and their friends are not allow to take in unhealthy snacks .
" this highlights the importance of friends ' behaviour and of peer modelling , and of the need for schools to put policies in place to back up health interventions . "
but chris howard , vice president of the naht , said while some of its members do have policies in place banning unhealthy snacks , the union did not support " solutions that impose solutions on children . "
dr howard said : " it 's up to our members to decide for themselves .
" certainly some members in schools with older pupils find that if children ca n't get what they want to eat inside school , they go down the road and get it .
" there 's a real problem there . "

the researchers found that peer pressure also had an impact on youngsters ' healthy eating .
they say the findings highlight the need for schools to put policies in place to back up healthy eating .
but the national association of head teachers -lrb- naht -rrb- said they do not back schemes imposing solutions on pupils .
in a year-long study , researchers from the cardiff institute of society , health and ethics looked at the snacking habits of nine to 11 year-olds at 43 primary schools in deprived areas of south wales and south west england .
limited impact twenty three schools were asked to start fruit tuck shops selling a variety of fruit at a fixed price and not to sell sweets and crisps .
all the schools continued with their existing policies on bringing food into school .
over the year-long study which was funded by the food standards agency , the tuck shops sold about 70,000 pieces of fruit - or 0.06 pieces of fruit per student per day .
at the end of the year the children were surveyed on how much fruit and other snacks they had eaten the day before .
they were also asked how much fruit they and their friends regularly ate at school .
the research found that fruit tuck shops alone had a limited impact on how much fruit children ate at school .
fruit tuck shops had a greater impact if unhealthy food was banned however , they had a much greater impact on schools which also had a " no food " or " fruit only policy " .
children who attended fruit tuck shops where fruit was the only food allowed in school ate 0.37 more portions of fruit per day than those at schools without a fruit tuck shop .
pupils at schools which banned all types of food ate 0.14 more portions of fruit per day , the research found .
where there were no restrictions on food being brought into school , fruit consumption was lower than at other schools , even if the school had a fruit tuck shop .
professor laurence moore , from the cardiff institute , said : " our results suggest that children are more willing to use fruit tuck shops and eat fruit as a snack at school if they and their friends are not allow to take in unhealthy snacks .
" this highlights the importance of friends ' behaviour and of peer modelling , and of the need for schools to put policies in place to back up health interventions . "
but chris howard , vice president of the naht , said while some of its members do have policies in place banning unhealthy snacks , the union did not support " solutions that impose solutions on children . "

around 470 people in wales are waiting for an organ transplant now and 780,000 people are on the organ donor register .
but leaders of the campaign say they want this new scheme to " get wales talking " about organ donation .
robert edwards , aged 13 is backing the scheme after being on the waiting list for a transplant for two years .
the boy , from dinas pows in the vale of glamorgan , was told he needed a kidney transplant two years ago after a viral infection caused damage to his kidneys as a three-year-old .
he has been receiving dialysis for 10 hours a day for two years .
meanwhile , roy thomas , executive chairman of kidney foundation wales , is to launch donate wales - tell a loved one , outside cardiff city hall on tuesday .

as a new organ donor sign-up drive is been launched would-be donors are urged ' tell a loved one ' .
balloons will be released at the launch representing 150 people in wales who have died since 2003 waiting for a donor , and another 471 who are still waiting .
mr thomas said : " if we are to bridge the gap between the number of people waiting for organs and the number of organs available , we need to start talking to our loved ones about our wished to become organ donors when we die and make sure we all join the organ donor register . "
in march , the assembly government announced a public consultation into possible changes to the way organs are donated and whether a system of presumed consent for donation should be introduced .
charities taking part in the campaign include kidney wales foundation , the british heart foundation , british liver trust , diabetes uk cymru and rnib cymru .
allison john -lrb- l -rrb- says she would have died without a transplant with a shortage of donors , campaigners say many people in need of transplants face the reality of having years to wait and may even die while on the waiting list .
during the last five years more than 750 lives have been transformed by a transplant , but more than 150 people - one every fortnight - have died before a donor could be found .
this latest campaign , which will run until september , is aimed at getting people to talk about what they want to happen to their organs when they die .
it also wants to tackle some of the misconceptions surrounding organ donation , such as there being no age limit to register or restrictions because of sexuality .
kidney wales foundation ambassador , allison john , who has undergone several life saving transplants , including her liver when just 17 , said : " i would have been dead 13 years ago if it was n't for those generous people who gave me the organs .
" it 's given me the freedom to be able to go to university , to travel the world , to live a normal life really . "
health minister edwina hart said : " discussing what happens to us and our organs after we die are thing most people do n't really want to think about but it is important for people to discuss the possibility with family members . "
the initiative is backed by a number of celebrities including colin jackson , james hook , connie fisher , ruth madoc , radio 1 's aled jones , iolo williams and stuart cable who will feature in a multi-media advertising campaigning over the summer .

around 470 people in wales are waiting for an organ transplant now and 780,000 people are on the organ donor register .
but leaders of the campaign say they want this new scheme to " get wales talking " about organ donation .
robert edwards , aged 13 is backing the scheme after being on the waiting list for a transplant for two years .
the boy , from dinas pows in the vale of glamorgan , was told he needed a kidney transplant two years ago after a viral infection caused damage to his kidneys as a three-year-old .
he has been receiving dialysis for 10 hours a day for two years .
meanwhile , roy thomas , executive chairman of kidney foundation wales , is to launch donate wales - tell a loved one , outside cardiff city hall on tuesday .

as a new organ donor sign-up drive is been launched would-be donors are urged ' tell a loved one ' .
balloons will be released at the launch representing 150 people in wales who have died since 2003 waiting for a donor , and another 471 who are still waiting .
mr thomas said : " if we are to bridge the gap between the number of people waiting for organs and the number of organs available , we need to start talking to our loved ones about our wished to become organ donors when we die and make sure we all join the organ donor register . "
in march , the assembly government announced a public consultation into possible changes to the way organs are donated and whether a system of presumed consent for donation should be introduced .
charities taking part in the campaign include kidney wales foundation , the british heart foundation , british liver trust , diabetes uk cymru and rnib cymru .
allison john -lrb- l -rrb- says she would have died without a transplant with a shortage of donors , campaigners say many people in need of transplants face the reality of having years to wait and may even die while on the waiting list .
during the last five years more than 750 lives have been transformed by a transplant , but more than 150 people - one every fortnight - have died before a donor could be found .
this latest campaign , which will run until september , is aimed at getting people to talk about what they want to happen to their organs when they die .
it also wants to tackle some of the misconceptions surrounding organ donation , such as there being no age limit to register or restrictions because of sexuality .

the children 's commissioner has called for an urgent improvement in sexual health services for young people .
patricia lewsley said sexual health clinics were often difficult to access for children in rural areas .
the commissioner said those living in fermanagh , for instance , would have to travel more then 60 miles to their nearest clinic and that most clinics only open during school or college hours .
" surveys have shown that as many a quarter of young people have had their first sexual experience before they are 16 , " she said .

mrs lewsley added that while the number of under-17s having babies fell last year to 142 , it was still too high .
the department of health said it would publish a strategy on sexual health promotion shortly .

there were 896 transactions between january and march compared to 2,120 over the same period a year ago .
the university of ulster quarterly house price index report said some of the 120 estate agents surveyed reported no sales at all .
however , the average price of £ 230,908 is still 7.5 % higher than a year ago .
but they still fell by 4.6 % in the first three months , which according to the report , demonstrated the continuing correction in the housing market .
the number of sales was the lowest since the survey began in 1984 .
the report 's authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and mrs louise brown insisted , however , price levels had not collapsed .
but they warned : " however , the short term quarter figures suggest a weak market during the first three months of 2008 which , if it continues into the second and third quarters of the year , may well see annual rates of change move into negative figures . "
according to the university 's research , price falls largely applied to properties worth less than £ 250,000 .
higher priced properties fared better and appeared to be less exposed to the current market downturn .
the economist alan bridle , head of research at bank of ireland which produced the survey in partnership with the university , said the local housing market was " technically in recession " for the first time since the early 1990s .
" as an observation we may have something of a stalemate , with vendors looking to sell at 2007 prices and potential buyers deferring purchase in anticipation of lower prices and easier access to credit later in 2008 or 2009 , " he said .
" it is not certain how this will play out over the coming quarters but the risks to prices remain on the downside . "
the housing executive 's head of research , joe frey , said although the fall in house prices at the lower end of the market would be welcomed by first-time buyers , it did not necessarily mean homes are becoming more affordable .
some banks and building societies were taking a much more risk-averse approach to lending .
" it is important therefore not to take our eye off the ball , in terms of putting the policies and practices in place which will facilitate the delivery of affordable homes in the longer term , " he said .
belfast 's average price was £ 254,011 - 22.4 % higher than a year previously but on a quarterly basis the average price for all property types fell , with the exception of detached houses .
south belfast is still the city 's highest priced region .
north down - average of £ 250,678 was up 10.7 % over the year and 3.1 % on the the quarter lisburn : average of £ 257,190 was down by 0.7 % over the year and by 9.8 % on the previous quarter .
east antrim : average of £ 211,662 was 12.6 % higher but down 2.4 % on the last quarter of 2007 .
antrim / ballymena : average was £ 188,147 , a fall of 9.9 % over the year and down by 10 % on the previous quarter .
coleraine / limavady / north coast , average price of £ 264,055 which represented a small annual increase of 3.1 % but down 5.7 % on the previous quarter .
derry / strabane : the average of £ 218,979 was still 21.1 % higher than a year before and showed a 4.6 % rise over the quarter .
however the volume of sales continued to be very low .
mid-ulster : average of £ 200,942 was down by 7.9 % over the quarter and by 17.7 % over the year - a response to the unsustainable high rates of growth seen the early part of last year .

there were 896 transactions between january and march compared to 2,120 over the same period a year ago .
the university of ulster quarterly house price index report said some of the 120 estate agents surveyed reported no sales at all .
however , the average price of £ 230,908 is still 7.5 % higher than a year ago .
but they still fell by 4.6 % in the first three months , which according to the report , demonstrated the continuing correction in the housing market .
the number of sales was the lowest since the survey began in 1984 .
the report 's authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and mrs louise brown insisted , however , price levels had not collapsed .
but they warned : " however , the short term quarter figures suggest a weak market during the first three months of 2008 which , if it continues into the second and third quarters of the year , may well see annual rates of change move into negative figures . "
according to the university 's research , price falls largely applied to properties worth less than £ 250,000 .
higher priced properties fared better and appeared to be less exposed to the current market downturn .
the economist alan bridle , head of research at bank of ireland which produced the survey in partnership with the university , said the local housing market was " technically in recession " for the first time since the early 1990s .
" as an observation we may have something of a stalemate , with vendors looking to sell at 2007 prices and potential buyers deferring purchase in anticipation of lower prices and easier access to credit later in 2008 or 2009 , " he said .
" it is not certain how this will play out over the coming quarters but the risks to prices remain on the downside . "
the housing executive 's head of research , joe frey , said although the fall in house prices at the lower end of the market would be welcomed by first-time buyers , it did not necessarily mean homes are becoming more affordable .
some banks and building societies were taking a much more risk-averse approach to lending .
" it is important therefore not to take our eye off the ball , in terms of putting the policies and practices in place which will facilitate the delivery of affordable homes in the longer term , " he said .
belfast 's average price was £ 254,011 - 22.4 % higher than a year previously but on a quarterly basis the average price for all property types fell , with the exception of detached houses .
south belfast is still the city 's highest priced region .
north down - average of £ 250,678 was up 10.7 % over the year and 3.1 % on the the quarter lisburn : average of £ 257,190 was down by 0.7 % over the year and by 9.8 % on the previous quarter .

however the volume of sales continued to be very low .

there were 896 transactions between january and march compared to 2,120 over the same period a year ago .
the university of ulster quarterly house price index report said some of the 120 estate agents surveyed reported no sales at all .
however , the average price of £ 230,908 is still 7.5 % higher than a year ago .
but they still fell by 4.6 % in the first three months , which according to the report , demonstrated the continuing correction in the housing market .
the number of sales was the lowest since the survey began in 1984 .
the report 's authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and mrs louise brown insisted , however , price levels had not collapsed .
but they warned : " however , the short term quarter figures suggest a weak market during the first three months of 2008 which , if it continues into the second and third quarters of the year , may well see annual rates of change move into negative figures . "
according to the university 's research , price falls largely applied to properties worth less than £ 250,000 .
higher priced properties fared better and appeared to be less exposed to the current market downturn .
the economist alan bridle , head of research at bank of ireland which produced the survey in partnership with the university , said the local housing market was " technically in recession " for the first time since the early 1990s .
" as an observation we may have something of a stalemate , with vendors looking to sell at 2007 prices and potential buyers deferring purchase in anticipation of lower prices and easier access to credit later in 2008 or 2009 , " he said .
" it is not certain how this will play out over the coming quarters but the risks to prices remain on the downside . "
the housing executive 's head of research , joe frey , said although the fall in house prices at the lower end of the market would be welcomed by first-time buyers , it did not necessarily mean homes are becoming more affordable .
some banks and building societies were taking a much more risk-averse approach to lending .
" it is important therefore not to take our eye off the ball , in terms of putting the policies and practices in place which will facilitate the delivery of affordable homes in the longer term , " he said .
belfast 's average price was £ 254,011 - 22.4 % higher than a year previously but on a quarterly basis the average price for all property types fell , with the exception of detached houses .
south belfast is still the city 's highest priced region .
north down - average of £ 250,678 was up 10.7 % over the year and 3.1 % on the the quarter lisburn : average of £ 257,190 was down by 0.7 % over the year and by 9.8 % on the previous quarter .
east antrim : average of £ 211,662 was 12.6 % higher but down 2.4 % on the last quarter of 2007 .
antrim / ballymena : average was £ 188,147 , a fall of 9.9 % over the year and down by 10 % on the previous quarter .
coleraine / limavady / north coast , average price of £ 264,055 which represented a small annual increase of 3.1 % but down 5.7 % on the previous quarter .
derry / strabane : the average of £ 218,979 was still 21.1 % higher than a year before and showed a 4.6 % rise over the quarter .
however the volume of sales continued to be very low .
mid-ulster : average of £ 200,942 was down by 7.9 % over the quarter and by 17.7 % over the year - a response to the unsustainable high rates of growth seen the early part of last year .
enniskillen / fermanagh / south tyrone : the average of £ 228,917 was up 7.2 % over a year and by 8.6 % over the quarter but the sample was small reflecting the continuing low levels of transactions .
craigavon / armagh : the average of £ 172,644 showed a sharp correction falling by 24.2 % over the quarter and by 22.4 % annually .
mid and south down : the average price of £ 259,570 was 18.2 % higher than a year previously and was up by 1.3 % on the quarter mainly because detached properties continued to perform strongly .

there were 896 transactions between january and march compared to 2,120 over the same period a year ago .
the university of ulster quarterly house price index report said some of the 120 estate agents surveyed reported no sales at all .
however , the average price of £ 230,908 is still 7.5 % higher than a year ago .
but they still fell by 4.6 % in the first three months , which according to the report , demonstrated the continuing correction in the housing market .
the number of sales was the lowest since the survey began in 1984 .
the report 's authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and mrs louise brown insisted , however , price levels had not collapsed .
but they warned : " however , the short term quarter figures suggest a weak market during the first three months of 2008 which , if it continues into the second and third quarters of the year , may well see annual rates of change move into negative figures . "
according to the university 's research , price falls largely applied to properties worth less than £ 250,000 .
higher priced properties fared better and appeared to be less exposed to the current market downturn .
the economist alan bridle , head of research at bank of ireland which produced the survey in partnership with the university , said the local housing market was " technically in recession " for the first time since the early 1990s .
" as an observation we may have something of a stalemate , with vendors looking to sell at 2007 prices and potential buyers deferring purchase in anticipation of lower prices and easier access to credit later in 2008 or 2009 , " he said .
" it is not certain how this will play out over the coming quarters but the risks to prices remain on the downside . "
the housing executive 's head of research , joe frey , said although the fall in house prices at the lower end of the market would be welcomed by first-time buyers , it did not necessarily mean homes are becoming more affordable .
some banks and building societies were taking a much more risk-averse approach to lending .
" it is important therefore not to take our eye off the ball , in terms of putting the policies and practices in place which will facilitate the delivery of affordable homes in the longer term , " he said .
belfast 's average price was £ 254,011 - 22.4 % higher than a year previously but on a quarterly basis the average price for all property types fell , with the exception of detached houses .
south belfast is still the city 's highest priced region .
north down - average of £ 250,678 was up 10.7 % over the year and 3.1 % on the the quarter lisburn : average of £ 257,190 was down by 0.7 % over the year and by 9.8 % on the previous quarter .
east antrim : average of £ 211,662 was 12.6 % higher but down 2.4 % on the last quarter of 2007 .
antrim / ballymena : average was £ 188,147 , a fall of 9.9 % over the year and down by 10 % on the previous quarter .
coleraine / limavady / north coast , average price of £ 264,055 which represented a small annual increase of 3.1 % but down 5.7 % on the previous quarter .
derry / strabane : the average of £ 218,979 was still 21.1 % higher than a year before and showed a 4.6 % rise over the quarter .
however the volume of sales continued to be very low .
mid-ulster : average of £ 200,942 was down by 7.9 % over the quarter and by 17.7 % over the year - a response to the unsustainable high rates of growth seen the early part of last year .
enniskillen / fermanagh / south tyrone : the average of £ 228,917 was up 7.2 % over a year and by 8.6 % over the quarter but the sample was small reflecting the continuing low levels of transactions .
craigavon / armagh : the average of £ 172,644 showed a sharp correction falling by 24.2 % over the quarter and by 22.4 % annually .
mid and south down : the average price of £ 259,570 was 18.2 % higher than a year previously and was up by 1.3 % on the quarter mainly because detached properties continued to perform strongly .

researchers found the way the drug works to combat impotence may also help ward off heart failure in muscular dystrophy patients .
tests on mice with a version of the disease showed the drug helped keep their hearts working well .
the montreal heart institute study appears in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
it is important to remember that benefits seen in animals do not always translate into human medicine dr marita pohlschmidt muscular dystrophy campaign muscular dystrophy is a genetic condition causing wasting of the muscles .
the first signs of muscular weakness appear at roughly age five , leading to a progressive loss in the ability to walk by the age of 13 .
people with the condition are also at a higher risk of heart failure due to a weakening of the muscles which keep the organ pumping strongly .
for this reason , many people with duchenne muscular dystrophy - the most common form of the condition - die in early life , often in their 20s or 30s .
blood flow the montreal team found that viagra - known technically as sildenafil - prevents the loss of a molecule , cgmp , which plays a key role in keeping blood vessels dilated .
in the penis , this increases blood flow , and helps to combat impotence .
but in the heart it helps to ensure the organ itself receives a proper supply of blood , and remains healthy and strong .
with the heart in a strong condition , it is more able to withstand the impact of weakening muscle cells caused by muscular dystrophy .
viagra works by blocking an enzyme , pde5 , which breaks down cgmp .
professor jean-claude tardif , director of the montreal heart institute research centre , said : " these experimental results give us hope that one day it will be possible to treat with this approach cardiac problems in patients with muscular dystrophy , and perhaps even treat other heart diseases . "
the researchers also inserted a gene that increased cgmp production in the mice 's heart cells , and found that this helped the animals to maintain normal cardiac function .
dr marita pohlschmidt , director of research at the muscular dystrophy campaign , said the research was interesting .
however , she added : " it is important to remember that benefits seen in animals do not always translate into human medicine .
" although this is promising , it is still very early days and we look forward to further research that will demonstrate the impact it might have for people with muscular dystrophy . "

researchers found the way the drug works to combat impotence may also help ward off heart failure in muscular dystrophy patients .

the montreal heart institute study appears in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
it is important to remember that benefits seen in animals do not always translate into human medicine dr marita pohlschmidt muscular dystrophy campaign muscular dystrophy is a genetic condition causing wasting of the muscles .
the first signs of muscular weakness appear at roughly age five , leading to a progressive loss in the ability to walk by the age of 13 .
people with the condition are also at a higher risk of heart failure due to a weakening of the muscles which keep the organ pumping strongly .
for this reason , many people with duchenne muscular dystrophy - the most common form of the condition - die in early life , often in their 20s or 30s .
blood flow the montreal team found that viagra - known technically as sildenafil - prevents the loss of a molecule , cgmp , which plays a key role in keeping blood vessels dilated .
in the penis , this increases blood flow , and helps to combat impotence .
but in the heart it helps to ensure the organ itself receives a proper supply of blood , and remains healthy and strong .
with the heart in a strong condition , it is more able to withstand the impact of weakening muscle cells caused by muscular dystrophy .
viagra works by blocking an enzyme , pde5 , which breaks down cgmp .

robert has been waiting longer than most children his age for a new kidney and mrs edwards admits it 's been a difficult and frustrating time .
the family has been unable to go on holiday for the last two years in case they receive a call that a donor organ is available - and a suitcase has been packed with hospital clothes ready for that time .
" you try and keep yourself occupied and make things as normal as possible for robert , but sometimes you reach a point where it just snaps , " she said .
" it must be the same for every parent whose child is ill - you think you can keep going , but in the end you do have moments where you break .
" every time you see a strange number on the phone you think ' is this it , is this the call saying a kidney is available ? " ' .
mrs edwards said it was difficult know that " something tragic has to happen for your child to be given a second chance " .
but she added : " the hope for us is knowing that so many people have already joined the organ donor register wanting to help people like robert .
that 's what we hold onto . "

of the 136 passengers and 16 crew , only one person was seriously injured .

the report also said that restrictions in the fuel system between the aircraft fuel tanks and each of the engine high pressure -lrb- hp -rrb- pumps may have resulted in reduced fuel flows .

the commons schools , children and families committee says teachers spend too much time " teaching to the test " .
" the inappropriate use of national testing could lead to damaging consequences , " warns the report .
schools minister jim knight welcomed mps ' recognition that the " principle of national testing is sound " .
with hundreds of thousands of 11-year-olds in england taking " sats " tests this week , the select committee report warns that the tests are being used in a way that does not benefit children or the schools system .
new type of test " in an effort to drive up national standards , too much emphasis has been placed on a single set of tests and this has been to the detriment of some aspects of the curriculum and some students , " says committee chairman barry sheerman .
testing figures pupils in england on average take 70 national tests while at school 54,000 examiners employed in national tests 25 million test papers each year source : gtc school tests around the uk while supporting the idea of national tests , the report from mps says that an " over-emphasis " on their results can distort how children are taught and " children 's access to a balanced education is being compromised " .
it also criticises the single-level tests which are being piloted as a possible alternative .
these tests , taken when teachers think pupils are ready to go up a level , are likely to perpetuate the drawbacks of the sats , such as narrowing the curriculum , suggests the report .
barry sheerman says too much emphasis is put on national tests and it warns that the single-level tests ' " one-way ratchet " system will lead to an " artificial " improvement in results , in which pupils will be " certified to have achieved a level of knowledge and understanding which they do not in truth possess " .
the report calls for a reform of the school performance tables , which for primary schools are based on the national test results .
it suggests that accountability should be based on a wider range of measures , including ofsted reports .
schools minister jim knight defended the use of national tests as part of the process of assessing progress for pupils , schools and the education system .

" along with teachers ' own judgements and ofsted reports , tests are a tool which help pupils and their parents to understand how well they are doing , help parents and teachers to understand how well their school is doing , and help the public to scrutinise the performance of the schools system .
" that 's why they are here to stay .
parents do n't want to go back to a world where the achievements of schools are hidden from them . "
mr knight was asked on the today programme on bbc radio four whether pupils were being put under too much stress at too early an age .
" if you do n't have the tests at 11 and 14 then there 's a danger that children then hit the very high stakes , high stress of gcses across the whole curriculum - not just english , maths and science - and the preparation that they get through sitting these sats at 11 and 14 is in that respect good for them even though it might be a slight level of stress . "
' disapproval ' but christine blower , acting general secretary of the national union of teachers , said the report identified the " poisonous effects of testing " .
" the government now stands isolated on the future of national curriculum testing .
it has steadfastly resisted the mounting evidence of the damage caused by the tests to the curriculum and children 's learning , " said ms blower .
chris keates of the nasuwt teachers ' union said : " it is pleasing to note that some aspects of the report confirm what the nasuwt has been saying for years , that the root of the problem is not the system of national testing but the performance league tables and other aspects of the not-fit-for-purpose accountability regime into which the test results are fed . "
john dunford , leader of the ascl head teachers ' union , said that the government should now " finally take seriously this groundswell of disapproval of the current testing regime " .
" the original purpose of examinations , to assess students ' progress , has become confused with school accountability and the performance management of teachers , " said dr dunford .
the heads ' union calls for random sampling to monitor standards , rather than targets based on national tests .

the commons schools , children and families committee says teachers spend too much time " teaching to the test " .
" the inappropriate use of national testing could lead to damaging consequences , " warns the report .
schools minister jim knight welcomed mps ' recognition that the " principle of national testing is sound " .
with hundreds of thousands of 11-year-olds in england taking " sats " tests this week , the select committee report warns that the tests are being used in a way that does not benefit children or the schools system .
new type of test " in an effort to drive up national standards , too much emphasis has been placed on a single set of tests and this has been to the detriment of some aspects of the curriculum and some students , " says committee chairman barry sheerman .
testing figures pupils in england on average take 70 national tests while at school 54,000 examiners employed in national tests 25 million test papers each year source : gtc school tests around the uk while supporting the idea of national tests , the report from mps says that an " over-emphasis " on their results can distort how children are taught and " children 's access to a balanced education is being compromised " .
it also criticises the single-level tests which are being piloted as a possible alternative .
these tests , taken when teachers think pupils are ready to go up a level , are likely to perpetuate the drawbacks of the sats , such as narrowing the curriculum , suggests the report .
barry sheerman says too much emphasis is put on national tests and it warns that the single-level tests ' " one-way ratchet " system will lead to an " artificial " improvement in results , in which pupils will be " certified to have achieved a level of knowledge and understanding which they do not in truth possess " .
the report calls for a reform of the school performance tables , which for primary schools are based on the national test results .
it suggests that accountability should be based on a wider range of measures , including ofsted reports .
schools minister jim knight defended the use of national tests as part of the process of assessing progress for pupils , schools and the education system .

" along with teachers ' own judgements and ofsted reports , tests are a tool which help pupils and their parents to understand how well they are doing , help parents and teachers to understand how well their school is doing , and help the public to scrutinise the performance of the schools system .
" that 's why they are here to stay .
parents do n't want to go back to a world where the achievements of schools are hidden from them . "
mr knight was asked on the today programme on bbc radio four whether pupils were being put under too much stress at too early an age .
" if you do n't have the tests at 11 and 14 then there 's a danger that children then hit the very high stakes , high stress of gcses across the whole curriculum - not just english , maths and science - and the preparation that they get through sitting these sats at 11 and 14 is in that respect good for them even though it might be a slight level of stress . "
' disapproval ' but christine blower , acting general secretary of the national union of teachers , said the report identified the " poisonous effects of testing " .
" the government now stands isolated on the future of national curriculum testing .
it has steadfastly resisted the mounting evidence of the damage caused by the tests to the curriculum and children 's learning , " said ms blower .
chris keates of the nasuwt teachers ' union said : " it is pleasing to note that some aspects of the report confirm what the nasuwt has been saying for years , that the root of the problem is not the system of national testing but the performance league tables and other aspects of the not-fit-for-purpose accountability regime into which the test results are fed . "
john dunford , leader of the ascl head teachers ' union , said that the government should now " finally take seriously this groundswell of disapproval of the current testing regime " .
" the original purpose of examinations , to assess students ' progress , has become confused with school accountability and the performance management of teachers , " said dr dunford .
the heads ' union calls for random sampling to monitor standards , rather than targets based on national tests .

there has been a generally good reception of the new government from business and diplomatic circles .
igor sechin was the deputy chief of vladimir putin 's presidential administration .
he was an enforcer , who also chaired russia 's biggest state oil company , rosneft , at the time when it controversially absorbed the yukos empire .
yukos was broken up and its billionaire boss mikhail khodorkovsky jailed .
mr sechin has been seen as something of a grey cardinal , opposed to the eventual nomination of dmitry medvedev as former president putin 's chosen successor .
his new post - deputy prime minister - is a minor demotion .
along with the removal of two of mr putin 's closest allies - the former justice minister , and the head of the domestic security service - mr sechin 's move suggests mr putin may be starting a process of mutual distancing from the hardest of the hardliners .
signs of continuity the former prime minister viktor zubkov - whose reputation is that of a competent manager rather than a great political thinker - stays on as a first deputy prime minister .
much more remarkable is igor shuvalov , a slick , fluent english-speaker , who advised mr putin on foreign economic affairs .
he has also been made a first deputy prime minister .
elsewhere , in defence and foreign affairs , continuity seems to be the key word .
the former ministers have kept their jobs .
effectively , however , this augurs against a softening of the hardline approach towards the west .
changes in the security establishment are also noteworthy .
the new head of the presidential administration is sergei naryshkin , a close confidant of mr putin from st petersburg .
another sign of the st petersburg clan 's continuing importance is the appointment of alexander bortnikov - a largely unknown functionary - as head of the fsb internal security service .

there has been a generally good reception of the new government from business and diplomatic circles .
igor sechin was the deputy chief of vladimir putin 's presidential administration .
he was an enforcer , who also chaired russia 's biggest state oil company , rosneft , at the time when it controversially absorbed the yukos empire .
yukos was broken up and its billionaire boss mikhail khodorkovsky jailed .
mr sechin has been seen as something of a grey cardinal , opposed to the eventual nomination of dmitry medvedev as former president putin 's chosen successor .
his new post - deputy prime minister - is a minor demotion .
along with the removal of two of mr putin 's closest allies - the former justice minister , and the head of the domestic security service - mr sechin 's move suggests mr putin may be starting a process of mutual distancing from the hardest of the hardliners .
signs of continuity the former prime minister viktor zubkov - whose reputation is that of a competent manager rather than a great political thinker - stays on as a first deputy prime minister .
much more remarkable is igor shuvalov , a slick , fluent english-speaker , who advised mr putin on foreign economic affairs .
he has also been made a first deputy prime minister .
elsewhere , in defence and foreign affairs , continuity seems to be the key word .
the former ministers have kept their jobs .
effectively , however , this augurs against a softening of the hardline approach towards the west .
changes in the security establishment are also noteworthy .
the new head of the presidential administration is sergei naryshkin , a close confidant of mr putin from st petersburg .
another sign of the st petersburg clan 's continuing importance is the appointment of alexander bortnikov - a largely unknown functionary - as head of the fsb internal security service .

now , 2.2 million parents stay at home , down on 2.8 million in 1993 , the survey commissioned by uswitch.com said .
many of the 2,198 adults surveyed - of which 1,391 were parents - cited the rising cost of living as the main reason for returning to work .
but the national family and parenting institute said parents had battled rising costs for years .
and it said the research failed to make special mention of part-time work , when it is an important element in balancing employment with caring for children .
the situation for lone parents was also not spelled out .
' choices taken away ' the survey found one third of working parents thought their children would have a better quality of life if they stayed at home , and seven in 10 parents would do this if money was no object .
it also said that for 18 % of parents with children under two , the main carer had to stay at home because they could not afford childcare .
the cost of childcare for the under-twos had risen by 33 % in the last six years to £ 8,268 per year .
ann robinson , director of consumer policy at uswitch.com , said economic factors were " taking away the choice for many young families " .
" people who want to stay at home ca n't afford to due to rising household bills , and even people who want to return to work ca n't afford to either , due to the high cost of childcare .
" as a result , both parents and children are losing out . "
' best start ' minister for children , young people and families beverley hughes said the government was committed to ensuring parents had the maximum choices possible and every child the best start in life .
" we have increased support to parents seeking to balance work and family commitments , raising the level of child benefit and increasing the maternity leave entitlement to 52 weeks , with a goal of extending paid maternity leave to 52 weeks .
" new rights to request flexible working arrangements and paid paternity leave have been introduced .
she also highlighted investment in childcare services and early years education for three and four-year-olds .

a baptist preacher 's wife , a business executive and a telecoms worker were selected from the 15 potential jurors questioned in court in chicago .
altogether 16 people , including four " alternate " jurors , will be chosen .
the performer has denied filming himself engaging in sex acts with a girl , whom prosecutors say could have been as young as 13 .
the executive - a middle-aged man - called child pornography " the lowest of the low " during questioning by the judge and lawyers .
but he said he felt he could give a fair trial to the 41-year-old singer .
" laws of man " the preacher 's wife comes from olympia fields , where mr kelly lives , and insisted her religious beliefs would not affect her time as a juror .
the judge reminded her that the trial involved the " laws of man , not the laws of god , " and she said she understood .
the telecoms worker , who is in his 50s , said he did not like seeing what he considered pornographic magazines at corner shops , but told the judge this would not influence the way he assessed the facts in the case .
he added that the only r kelly song he knew was the 1997 hit i believe i can fly .
potential jurors who were dismissed included a man in his 50s whom prosecutors said was clearly awestruck by mr kelly 's celebrity , plus a security guard who said mr kelly would have " some explaining to do " if he was on the video .
twenty other potential jurors out of an initial pool of 150 are scheduled to face questions on the second day of selection , which is expected to take a week .
mr kelly was charged in 2002 with 21 counts relating to child pornography and released on $ 750,000 -lrb- £ 383,000 -rrb- bail .
seven of the charges have since been dropped .
the singer faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

a baptist preacher 's wife , a business executive and a telecoms worker were selected from the 15 potential jurors questioned in court in chicago .
altogether 16 people , including four " alternate " jurors , will be chosen .
the performer has denied filming himself engaging in sex acts with a girl , whom prosecutors say could have been as young as 13 .
the executive - a middle-aged man - called child pornography " the lowest of the low " during questioning by the judge and lawyers .
but he said he felt he could give a fair trial to the 41-year-old singer .
" laws of man " the preacher 's wife comes from olympia fields , where mr kelly lives , and insisted her religious beliefs would not affect her time as a juror .
the judge reminded her that the trial involved the " laws of man , not the laws of god , " and she said she understood .
the telecoms worker , who is in his 50s , said he did not like seeing what he considered pornographic magazines at corner shops , but told the judge this would not influence the way he assessed the facts in the case .
he added that the only r kelly song he knew was the 1997 hit i believe i can fly .
potential jurors who were dismissed included a man in his 50s whom prosecutors said was clearly awestruck by mr kelly 's celebrity , plus a security guard who said mr kelly would have " some explaining to do " if he was on the video .
twenty other potential jurors out of an initial pool of 150 are scheduled to face questions on the second day of selection , which is expected to take a week .
mr kelly was charged in 2002 with 21 counts relating to child pornography and released on $ 750,000 -lrb- £ 383,000 -rrb- bail .
seven of the charges have since been dropped .
the singer faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

the website has been shut down since saturday .
visitors to the site are being redirected to the website of the state-owned sunday mail newspaper .
the herald is regarded as the official mouthpiece of president robert mugabe 's ruling zanu-pf party .
the company 's it manager , thomson ndovi , confirmed that the newspaper had been hacked .
" we are still waiting for our service providers to give us feedback , " he told reuters , " but we should be up and running by tomorrow " .
headlines on the site were replaced by the word gukurahundi .
the word refers to a campaign of mass slaughter that the government has been accused of carrying out after independence .
human rights groups say the government killed about 20,000 people in matabeleland in western zimbabwe in the early 1980s .
zanu-pf says at the time it was suppressing an insurgency by the then opposition zapu renegades .
no choice for tsvangirai accounts of violence militias ' to rig election ' it also disputes the number of people killed .
the leader of the opposition mdc , morgan tsvangirai says he will contest a run-off presidential vote against robert mugabe .
he still believes he won the first round outright and accuses the ruling zanu-pf of vote-rigging .
zimbabwe 's electoral commission says the second round may be delayed due to logistical problems .
it says it is unlikely the run-off could be held by 23 may , as stipulated by law .
according to official declarations , the opposition leader won 47.9 % of the vote , against 43.2 % for mr mugabe .
although the first round was largely peaceful , the results were not announced until 2 may .
the mdc says the delay gave the authorities time to rig the counting and carry out attacks on its supporters .

but none are praying harder -lrb- for a ticket but at least a win -rrb- than daniel o 'brien , 67 , an evangelical missionary in brazil .
he has spent 18 years bringing his love of the lord - and the bluebirds - to a slum in brazil 's third largest city .
pastor o 'brien heads an evangelical mission in the favela or shanty town area of belo horizonte , a city of 2.4m people in south east brazil .
the grangetown-born fan has returned to wales every two years since moving to brazil in 1990 as a widower .
he remarried and has another son , lucas , 13 .
at least here in my area , the vila leblon know who cardiff city are and they certainly know about wales - i remind them that wales beat brasil 1-0 once pastor daniel o 'brien , brazil belo horizonte has brazil 's second biggest football stadium , mineirão , shared by two two teams cruzeiros and atletico .
pr o 'brien said : " as you can imagine they are fanatical here for their football teams .
" our families in the favela vila leblon always ask me on mondays ' did cardiff city win again this week ' .
" they cheer me up when the result has gone against us , and cheer with me when they win .
" at least here in my area , the vila leblon know who cardiff city are and they certainly know about wales -lrb- pais de galês -rrb- .
" i remind them that wales beat brasil 1-0 once .
que sera sera - pr o 'brien hopes he will be going to wembley too " i log onto the internet every saturday to find out the results of cardiff city first , and when i have the time , i linkup to the live text that changes every two minutes .
" that 's how i got the result of the first half of the semi final . "
he watched the second half of the game against barnsley over the internet after his son in wales , david , put a webcam in front of his tv .
he said : " praise god tears of joy were flowing freely - my prayers answered - cardiff were in the final .
" my ministry team is very supportive of my team and will be praying with me for them to win the fa cup . "
pr o 'brien is still praying for some tickets to turn up in the post but , failing that , he hopes his local tv station will screen the match live for him and his flock .

but none are praying harder -lrb- for a ticket but at least a win -rrb- than daniel o 'brien , 67 , an evangelical missionary in brazil .
he has spent 18 years bringing his love of the lord - and the bluebirds - to a slum in brazil 's third largest city .
pastor o 'brien heads an evangelical mission in the favela or shanty town area of belo horizonte , a city of 2.4m people in south east brazil .
the grangetown-born fan has returned to wales every two years since moving to brazil in 1990 as a widower .
he remarried and has another son , lucas , 13 .
at least here in my area , the vila leblon know who cardiff city are and they certainly know about wales - i remind them that wales beat brasil 1-0 once pastor daniel o 'brien , brazil belo horizonte has brazil 's second biggest football stadium , mineirão , shared by two two teams cruzeiros and atletico .
pr o 'brien said : " as you can imagine they are fanatical here for their football teams .
" our families in the favela vila leblon always ask me on mondays ' did cardiff city win again this week ' .
" they cheer me up when the result has gone against us , and cheer with me when they win .

" that 's how i got the result of the first half of the semi final . "
he watched the second half of the game against barnsley over the internet after his son in wales , david , put a webcam in front of his tv .
he said : " praise god tears of joy were flowing freely - my prayers answered - cardiff were in the final .
" my ministry team is very supportive of my team and will be praying with me for them to win the fa cup . "
pr o 'brien is still praying for some tickets to turn up in the post but , failing that , he hopes his local tv station will screen the match live for him and his flock .

more time and resources were needed to increase production , the company said , which would result in fewer deliveries than planned during 2008 and 2009 .
earlier this month , two airlines revealed that airbus had warned them of possible further delays .
deliveries of the a380 are already running almost two years late because of delays centred on wiring problems .
the company said the latest delays were due to problems moving from the initial production phase , responsible for the first 25 aircraft , to a more intensive production line .
no details were given about the financial implications of the announcement .
" the extent of the additional costs will be influenced by the actual production and delivery scenario , " airbus said .
customer discussions airbus - which is part of aerospace group eads - now plans to deliver 12 planes this year , instead of the 13 expected .
in 2009 , 21 a380s will be supplied to carriers against the previous plan to deliver 25 .
deliveries for 2010 would be discussed with airlines in the coming weeks , airbus added .
the first a380 entered commercial service last year with singapore airlines , while emirates is the plane 's largest customer .
eads said that four a380s have been delivered as planned , while a further 17 were in various stages of production .
both dubai-based emirates and abu dhabi-based etihad airways said earlier this month they had received warning of delays .
british airways has ordered 12 a380s , due to be delivered from 2012 , while virgin atlantic has ordered six , to arrive from 2013 .
the airliner 's wings are made at broughton in north wales and at filton in bristol .

more time and resources were needed to increase production , the company said , which would result in fewer deliveries than planned during 2008 and 2009 .
earlier this month , two airlines revealed that airbus had warned them of possible further delays .
deliveries of the a380 are already running almost two years late because of delays centred on wiring problems .
the company said the latest delays were due to problems moving from the initial production phase , responsible for the first 25 aircraft , to a more intensive production line .
no details were given about the financial implications of the announcement .
" the extent of the additional costs will be influenced by the actual production and delivery scenario , " airbus said .
customer discussions airbus - which is part of aerospace group eads - now plans to deliver 12 planes this year , instead of the 13 expected .
in 2009 , 21 a380s will be supplied to carriers against the previous plan to deliver 25 .
deliveries for 2010 would be discussed with airlines in the coming weeks , airbus added .
the first a380 entered commercial service last year with singapore airlines , while emirates is the plane 's largest customer .
eads said that four a380s have been delivered as planned , while a further 17 were in various stages of production .
both dubai-based emirates and abu dhabi-based etihad airways said earlier this month they had received warning of delays .
british airways has ordered 12 a380s , due to be delivered from 2012 , while virgin atlantic has ordered six , to arrive from 2013 .
the airliner 's wings are made at broughton in north wales and at filton in bristol .
