program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .
yushchenko has called for the government to stop preaching populism " and instead work on precise anti-inflationary measures . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "

while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .
yushchenko has called for the government to stop preaching populism " and instead work on precise anti-inflationary measures . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .
" he still has four years -lsb- in office -rsb- .
i would encourage him to come back to this soon . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 16.05.2008 eu , us face deadlock in liberalizing aviation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us ca n't agree on just how open the skies should be the first phase of the eu-us " open skies " agreement has been hailed as a success .
now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.05.2008 personal , political clouds gather over eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change , biofuels and the food crisis could set allies against each other in lima leaders of the eu , caribbean and latin america meet for two days in lima , peru , for talks on topics such as trade and climate change .
meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .

the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .

then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

" the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate .

" unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.05.2008 pressure grows for single euro seat at imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro would be stronger if the euro zone had a single imf representative , say some pressure is growing on euro-zone governments to cast their national interests to the side and give their shared currency a stronger voice on the global stage by seeking a single seat at the international monetary fund . calls to strengthen the euro 's position at the imf were made on thursday , may 15 , by two of the shared currency 's most influential figures while addressing an economic forum in brussels celebrating 10 years of the european economic and monetary union -lrb- emu -rrb- . " our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .
" he still has four years -lsb- in office -rsb- .
i would encourage him to come back to this soon . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

steinmeier said his calls for a modernization partnership were “ met with open ears . ”
steinmeier said he “ received a lot of support ” for help in the health care and energy sectors .
steinmeier said he expects concrete cooperation proposals to be forthcoming .
reforms key to economic success steinmeier also did n't stray from the message he 's been delivering all week : that russia needs to show its commitment to the rule of law and to governmental reform .
steinmeier said friday he got the impression that russia wants to strengthen its rule of law and create the legal and governmental frameworks needed for sustainable economic growth .
without democratic reforms and a safe environment for investors , russia will not be able to reach its economic goals , steinmeier said .
steinmeier ended his trip by meeting with top officials in st. petersburg on friday , including the influential governor valentina matviyenko .
the st. petersburg region , which stretches to finland and estonia , is the second most important economic area in russia after moscow .
the region has traditionally had strong trade ties to germany and approximately 400 german companies are active there .
steinmeier wants speedy negotiations steinmeier 's trip included meeting with newly-elected russian president dmitry medvedev .
he is the first western minister to visit russia since medvedev was inaugurated last week .
medvedev announced he will visit germany in june , his first trip as president to a european country .
the trip took on new significance after lithuania gave a green light on sunday to begin negotiations on a new eu partnership treaty with russia .
lithuania had blocked negotiations over concerns about russian energy and foreign policy .
steinmeier called for speedy negotiations on the eu partnership treaty , pointing out that europe and russia need each other when it comes to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 16.05.2008 eu , us face deadlock in liberalizing aviation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us ca n't agree on just how open the skies should be the first phase of the eu-us " open skies " agreement has been hailed as a success .
now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one 35-year-old turkish national , who had been sought under a european arrest warrant , was arrested in weil am rhein , a german town near the borders with france and switzerland .
in addition , the dutch public prosecutor 's office said that a 48-year-old turkish national was arrested in the city of tilburg .
police seized computers , files and ammunition during searches of three homes in tilburg . connections to uzbek terrorists all those arrested were suspected of supporting a funding network that helped finance the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a shadowy uzbek-based organization , according to the german public broadcaster swr . the iju first came to prominence in europe with the arrest of a trio of alleged members in germany in september last year for plotting a car bomb attack .
two of the trio arrested last year , fritz g and daniel s , were german converts to islam .
they and adem y , a turkish national , are expected to face charges of buying bomb-making chemicals to attack the a us air base near frankfurt as well as the us and uzbek consulates . detentions were " pre-emptive " the arrests were a " pre-emptive measure " and none of the suspects had committed attacks , the french source told afp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .
yushchenko has called for the government to stop preaching populism " and instead work on precise anti-inflationary measures . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one 35-year-old turkish national , who had been sought under a european arrest warrant , was arrested in weil am rhein , a german town near the borders with france and switzerland .
in addition , the dutch public prosecutor 's office said that a 48-year-old turkish national was arrested in the city of tilburg .

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .
germany has insisted german troops are making headway in stabilizing the north . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate .

" it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france .

two uncapped players were named and a 19-year-old midfielder . uncapped teenage winger marko marin , from second-division borussia moenchengladbach , is the shock inclusion in germany 's extended 26-man squad for next month 's euro 2008 tournament . the 19-year-old , who has starred for germany 's under-21 side , has been included in the preliminary senior squad by loew for next month 's tournament in austria and switzerland from june 7 to 29 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand did n't make the cut marin has helped his side win promotion back to the bundesliga this season after a year in the second division and the teenager admitted he was stunned .
" i am totally overjoyed and can hardly believe it , " said marin , who flies out with the squad on monday to their spanish training camp .
" it was hard to take it all in at once .
i am really looking forward to the 12 days in majorca now . " there was also a surprise call-up for bayer leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler at the expense of germany 's reserve keeper timo hildebrand , 29 , who had been a member of the german 2006 world cup squad .
hildebrand moved to spain 's valencia from vfb stuttgart before the season and was regarded as an understudy to goalkeeper jens lehmann . striker patrick helmes has also made the squad after his second-division side cologne won promotion back into to the bundesliga . loew chose to make the squad announcement at the zugspitze , germany 's highest mountain which is located on the border to austria , in a symbolic gesture demonstrating his aim of reaching europe 's soccer summit . finalized at end of may loew will take his squad to majorca , spain on monday for a training camp and will cut his squad to 23 when the euro 2008 squad is finalized on may 28 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is the new man between the posts regarding the omission of hildebrand , loew said that decision had been particularly difficult . " all the players omitted were painfully disappointed , " he said although he would n't comment on whether it meant the end of hildebrand 's international career .
" what this means for his further career we will have to leave open . " about bosnian-born marin , who has only played four matches in the bundesliga , loew said he provided something different to the squad . " he is good man against man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .
yushchenko has called for the government to stop preaching populism " and instead work on precise anti-inflationary measures . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "

while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .
germany has insisted german troops are making headway in stabilizing the north . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what this means for his further career we will have to leave open . " about bosnian-born marin , who has only played four matches in the bundesliga , loew said he provided something different to the squad . " he is good man against man .
he has a wonderful quality about his play , very strong in on-again-on situations , " the coach said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.05.2008 personal , political clouds gather over eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change , biofuels and the food crisis could set allies against each other in lima leaders of the eu , caribbean and latin america meet for two days in lima , peru , for talks on topics such as trade and climate change .
meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

steinmeier said his calls for a modernization partnership were “ met with open ears . ”
steinmeier said he “ received a lot of support ” for help in the health care and energy sectors .
steinmeier said he expects concrete cooperation proposals to be forthcoming .
reforms key to economic success steinmeier also did n't stray from the message he 's been delivering all week : that russia needs to show its commitment to the rule of law and to governmental reform .
steinmeier said friday he got the impression that russia wants to strengthen its rule of law and create the legal and governmental frameworks needed for sustainable economic growth .
without democratic reforms and a safe environment for investors , russia will not be able to reach its economic goals , steinmeier said .
steinmeier ended his trip by meeting with top officials in st. petersburg on friday , including the influential governor valentina matviyenko .
the st. petersburg region , which stretches to finland and estonia , is the second most important economic area in russia after moscow .
the region has traditionally had strong trade ties to germany and approximately 400 german companies are active there .
steinmeier wants speedy negotiations steinmeier 's trip included meeting with newly-elected russian president dmitry medvedev .
he is the first western minister to visit russia since medvedev was inaugurated last week .
medvedev announced he will visit germany in june , his first trip as president to a european country .
the trip took on new significance after lithuania gave a green light on sunday to begin negotiations on a new eu partnership treaty with russia .
lithuania had blocked negotiations over concerns about russian energy and foreign policy .
steinmeier called for speedy negotiations on the eu partnership treaty , pointing out that europe and russia need each other when it comes to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.05.2008 personal , political clouds gather over eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change , biofuels and the food crisis could set allies against each other in lima leaders of the eu , caribbean and latin america meet for two days in lima , peru , for talks on topics such as trade and climate change .
meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .
" he still has four years -lsb- in office -rsb- .
i would encourage him to come back to this soon . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.05.2008 pressure grows for single euro seat at imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro would be stronger if the euro zone had a single imf representative , say some pressure is growing on euro-zone governments to cast their national interests to the side and give their shared currency a stronger voice on the global stage by seeking a single seat at the international monetary fund . calls to strengthen the euro 's position at the imf were made on thursday , may 15 , by two of the shared currency 's most influential figures while addressing an economic forum in brussels celebrating 10 years of the european economic and monetary union -lrb- emu -rrb- . " our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .
" he still has four years -lsb- in office -rsb- .
i would encourage him to come back to this soon . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.05.2008 personal , political clouds gather over eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change , biofuels and the food crisis could set allies against each other in lima leaders of the eu , caribbean and latin america meet for two days in lima , peru , for talks on topics such as trade and climate change .
meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .

steinmeier said his calls for a modernization partnership were “ met with open ears . ”
steinmeier said he “ received a lot of support ” for help in the health care and energy sectors .
steinmeier said he expects concrete cooperation proposals to be forthcoming .
reforms key to economic success steinmeier also did n't stray from the message he 's been delivering all week : that russia needs to show its commitment to the rule of law and to governmental reform .
steinmeier said friday he got the impression that russia wants to strengthen its rule of law and create the legal and governmental frameworks needed for sustainable economic growth .
without democratic reforms and a safe environment for investors , russia will not be able to reach its economic goals , steinmeier said .
steinmeier ended his trip by meeting with top officials in st. petersburg on friday , including the influential governor valentina matviyenko .
the st. petersburg region , which stretches to finland and estonia , is the second most important economic area in russia after moscow .
the region has traditionally had strong trade ties to germany and approximately 400 german companies are active there .
steinmeier wants speedy negotiations steinmeier 's trip included meeting with newly-elected russian president dmitry medvedev .
he is the first western minister to visit russia since medvedev was inaugurated last week .
medvedev announced he will visit germany in june , his first trip as president to a european country .
the trip took on new significance after lithuania gave a green light on sunday to begin negotiations on a new eu partnership treaty with russia .
lithuania had blocked negotiations over concerns about russian energy and foreign policy .
steinmeier called for speedy negotiations on the eu partnership treaty , pointing out that europe and russia need each other when it comes to energy security , weapons control , the fight against terrorism and climate protection . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "

yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year .

this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .

while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "

yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .

and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 16.05.2008 eu , us face deadlock in liberalizing aviation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us ca n't agree on just how open the skies should be the first phase of the eu-us " open skies " agreement has been hailed as a success .
now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was hard to take it all in at once .
i am really looking forward to the 12 days in majorca now . " there was also a surprise call-up for bayer leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler at the expense of germany 's reserve keeper timo hildebrand , 29 , who had been a member of the german 2006 world cup squad .

" what this means for his further career we will have to leave open . " about bosnian-born marin , who has only played four matches in the bundesliga , loew said he provided something different to the squad . " he is good man against man .
he has a wonderful quality about his play , very strong in on-again-on situations , " the coach said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 16.05.2008 eu , us face deadlock in liberalizing aviation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us ca n't agree on just how open the skies should be the first phase of the eu-us " open skies " agreement has been hailed as a success .
now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .
but they are bound to resonate at a time of heightened financial instability and global economic slowdown . while the euro has defied many critics to become an economic success story , most experts recognize that , politically , it is still punching below its weight . many euro-zone governments , for instance , frequently complain that china 's renminbi is unfairly undervalued , thus making chinese imports cheaper and euro-zone exports more expensive . but as imf chief dominique strauss-kahn pointed out in brussels , " the chinese are rarely interested in the euro exchange rate . "
he called that position a sign of the euro area lacking " the voice it should have . " each of the 15 european countries that use the euro is currently represented individually at the imf , an international organization that oversees the global financial system and thus plays a key role in the global economic arena . such divisions mean that , while the united states has strong voting powers , euro-zone heavyweights germany and france do not . " it makes sense for the euro zone , which is run by a single central bank , to have a common representation at the imf , " said philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform . " unfortunately , i do not see it happening any time soon , " he told german news agency dpa . whyte said " political jealousy " and resistance to having a country 's representation downgraded in international forums are likely to stand in the way for years to come . message to sarkozy juncker , who is also prime minister of luxembourg , hinted that short-term changes were unlikely . " throughout the history of europe , we have seen a battle between short term national interests and broader medium and long term objectives , and this kind of antagonism will continue , " he said in his speech . but euro member states will eventually understand that " the medium and long term benefits are greater than the short term costs , " he added . juncker said future euro-zone finance ministers regularly speak in favor of a single representation at the imf , only to backtrack once they assume office . he then turned against what many experts identify as one of the greatest obstacles to euro-zone unity : france . " -lsb- french president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy also talked about a single representation in the imf before he became president , " juncker said .
" he still has four years -lsb- in office -rsb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .
yushchenko has called for the government to stop preaching populism " and instead work on precise anti-inflationary measures . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.05.2008 personal , political clouds gather over eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change , biofuels and the food crisis could set allies against each other in lima leaders of the eu , caribbean and latin america meet for two days in lima , peru , for talks on topics such as trade and climate change .
meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .

" our currency is the second most important in the world , " said joaquin almunia , the european union commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs .
" our policy decisions have a global impact and increasingly the euro area is helping to support the stability of the global economy and financial system . " the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international forums , " he added . almunia 's ambitions are backed by jean-claude juncker , the influential chairman of the 15-member euro group . " in the long term , the euro zone will be represented in the imf by one single seat , " he said in his address to the forum participants , which include the finance ministers of france , the netherlands and spain as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . euro needs stronger voice , says imf chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf chief dominique strauss-kahn calls of this kind are not new .

he added that the organization 's internal problems should n't have been made public . irresolvable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim is set to announce the opera 's upcoming program at the end of april , mussbach had announced that he was unable to present a viable artistic budget due to disagreements over how to spend the extra 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- injected by the city state of berlin . the money from berlin was intended to help make up for losses incurred during the renovation of the opera house on unter den linden , slated to begin in 2010 . while mussbach had wanted more money for opera productions , barenboim preferred to invest in the staatskapelle orchestra .
mussbach 's departure effectively resolves the conflict . barenboim is set to announce the program for the 2008-2009 season on friday in an annual press conference . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now disagreements over investment requirements and majority voting rights threaten the second round of negotiations . " the european union has one clear political goal , we want to establish an open aviation area between the united states of america and the european union , " zoltan kazatsay from the european commission 's transport wing , said at the launch of the second round of talks in slovenia , on thursday , may 15 . the meeting follows an initial open skies agreement , which went into effect at the end of march .
it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it effectively allows any eu carrier to fly to any point in the us and vice versa . both phases of open skies aim to increase competition , slash ticket costs and potentially pave the way for the first-ever trans-atlantic aviation mergers . us fears takeovers during economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-atlantic flights have reportedly increased since open skies part one took effect investment and voting rights are slated to be the focus of the second round .
while the previous agreement allows eu carriers to buy majority stakes in us airlines , it restricts their voting rights to 25 percent . american carriers , on the other hand , currently have a voting privilege that is capped at 49 percent , though this could change if negotiations fail to resolve the discrepancy . the us congress has strongly opposed expanding the rights of eu buyers , fearing that this could make us airlines a target for takeovers , particularly due the current turmoil in financial markets and weak dollar . " it 's going to take a lot of work to persuade our congress that this is something that should be allowed , " said boyden gray , us special envoy for eu affairs . in a surprise move earlier this week , the us said it would seek a broader agreement by promising to cut access restrictions for carriers from over 60 countries . however , kazatsay said the eu preferred to focus on deepening the existing deal . " we think that a broader multilateral initiative can not replace the bilateral removal of this type of restrictions , " he said . no resolution in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say mergers lead to efficiency but us carriers are worried about getting burned prospects are slim that open skies will be wrapped up any time soon . " i think by some time next decade we will have virtually everything , by 2020 perhaps , but by 2010 - i do n't know , " said gray . the previously implemented deal is set to be reviewed in 2010 , and some elements could be changed if the second round fails .
britain , a major critic in the first round , has already threatened to exercise its right to end the agreement if the us does not lower investment barriers . despite receiving initial criticism , open skies is considered to have been a success thus far . " we are already seeing concrete benefits , very positive developments , " said daniel calleja crespo , director of aviation at the european commission 's transport department . he added that he expected an 8 percent rise this summer between the eu and the us , compared to 2007 , and that about 20 percent more trans-atlantic flights were be operating out of london 's heathrow airport . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "

while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.05.2008 ukraine joins wto as political , economic worries mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine hopes to boost its economy ukraine took the historic step of joining the world trade organization on friday , may 16 .
while the government hopes membership will boost the economy , the country seems headed for trouble . wto membership will mean reduced tariffs and increased competition in ukraine .
but as the former soviet states slides towards yet another political crisis , many observers wonder whether the market reforms are going to do much good .
soaring inflation and slowing growth has been at the center of ukraine ’ s latest political crisis , which threatened to break apart the coalition of president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko .
yushchenko , an ex-gas magnate turned social crusader , has pinned his hopes on wto membership , saying it will bump up the country 's gross domestic product and drop consumer prices .
" these are -lrb- economic -rrb- results that no one can oppose , " yushchenko said when he signed the agreement to join the wto in february .
yet observers question the government ’ s hope that wto membership is the ticket to slowing inflation .
in the three months since the wto deal was signed , ukraine ’ s consumer prices have gone up 10 to 15 percent with annual inflation close to 50 percent .
business elite set to profit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices have increased sharply in ukraine ukraine 's economics minister bohdan danilishin was adamant on thursday that wto membership would help average ukrainians .
" consumers will receive a double benefit , " danilishin was quoted by interfax as saying .
" lower income consumers will be able to buy cheaper food , while non-poor consumers will benefit from greater access to telecoms and financial services . "
but ukrainian media and economists have questioned the government 's rosy outlook .
they predict that ukrainian oligarchs will profit handsomely while average consumers will see few benefits .
wto membership is likely to give a boost to the lucky few who control industries such fertilizer , wheat , chemicals and sunflower seeds , according to the fakty newspaper .
ukrainian steel barons are among those expected to profit the most , as export duties for lucrative markets such as the united states and european union will automatically be halved .
furthermore , ukrainian steel can no longer be excluded from certain markets , which has happened in the past triggered by worries that it would undercut the price .
food prices rise steeply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko has made the economy a central theme ukrainian agricultural barons raised their prices steeply in recent months , anticipating a hit they will take once wto rules cancel government-imposed quotas on foreign agricultural products and impose sales tax , according to the silski novyny newspaper .
ukrainian farmers face 20 to 40 percent price increases over night , which in turn caused an increase in retail food prices by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the year , korrespondent newspaper reported .
while that might give imported food a competitive edge , that “ assumes we have a free and open foods market here , " bogoslav pilishinsky , a kiev-based food industry trader , told the dpa news agency .
" our foods market is overregulated , expensive to enter , and has a few major players , " he said .
" foreign food will probably replace ukrainian food on supermarket shelves , but i do n't see any incentives for supermarket chains to cut their prices . "
retail goods , particularly those not produced in quantity in ukraine , are expected to become somewhat cheaper , including household appliances , apparel , medical supplies , and automobiles .
" but it 's hard to say how much good that is going to do across the board , " vadym kozachenko , a kiev-based economist , told dpa .
" the poor ones just buy food , and the rich ones are going to buy in any case . "
" the risk factor here is that wto membership typically benefits middle class consumers , " kozachenko said .
" there are n't that many mid-range consumers like that in our economy - we have a few very rich , and a great many poor . "
political crisis looming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto has 152 members ukraine 's entry into the 152-member global trading community has been heralded as a major step for the former soviet state .
it shows the distance ukraine has come since the first half of the 1990s , when the country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,400 percent .
yet there have been troubling signs that the post-soviet republic is headed towards yet another political crisis .
ukraine ’ s government has seen constant political infighting since the 2004 elections and mass protests which brought pro-western parties to power .
and the alliance between the former “ orange ” revolution proponents has shown signs of strain .
on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a former central banker , threatened to break off her alliance with yushchenko .
her supporters barred the president from giving his annual parliamentary address .
it was the president ’ s second abortive attempt to give the speech this year . " if the situation in the country does not improve , the prime minister can not be the partner and ally of the president , " tymoshenko said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko hopes wto membership will slow inflation " to humiliate your own country , practically destroy in the economy everything that we are creating - this is no way to fight for the next presidential election , " she said . tymoshenko is now making open accusations against yushchenko which she has not done before .
this could mean that the coalition is on the verge of collapse , analyst volodymyr fesenko , director of the penta think tank told reuters earlier this week . simmering disagreements between ukraine ’ s two top politicians have “ now boiled over into outright political confrontation , ” fesenko said . tymoshenko ’ s ruling coalition has a mere one vote majority .
the government , in place since december , has been accused by “ populist ” spending measures which they say are contributing to the price increases .
yushchenko has called for the government to stop preaching populism " and instead work on precise anti-inflationary measures . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.05.2008 personal , political clouds gather over eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change , biofuels and the food crisis could set allies against each other in lima leaders of the eu , caribbean and latin america meet for two days in lima , peru , for talks on topics such as trade and climate change .
meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .
germany has insisted german troops are making headway in stabilizing the north . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jung approved the request from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on thursday , a spokesman from his ministry said .
he added that the aim of the operation was to flush out insurgents who had infiltrated the western provinces of badghis and faryab .
german soldiers will support the afghan army during the operation as well as a norwegian rapid reaction force .
a further 20 german troops will be on standby to work as part of the medevac medical unit for emergency evacuations .
the german defense ministry has said the deployment was part of reconstruction efforts in the region , adding it would help to cement the influence of the central afghan government in kabul in remote parts of western afghanistan .
the operation is also aimed at building trust among the population towards the nato-led isaf force and afghan soldiers .
this is not the first time german soldiers have taken part in an operation , the defense ministry spokesman added , the last time being in december 2007 .
under the terms of the mandate approved by german lawmakers , the country 's 3,200 troops based in the comparatively safe north of afghanistan can take part in operations elsewhere in the country as long as they are of a limited nature .
germany reluctant to deploy south germany has long resisted pressure from nato allies to deploy troops on a permanent basis to the south of the country where us , british and canadian soldiers are bearing the brunt of a taliban insurgency .
there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january this year they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .
germany has insisted german troops are making headway in stabilizing the north . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .
while on a visit to an oil field in the central state of guarico with portugal 's prime minister jose socrates , chavez said he had made those comments to president lula da silva of brazil in a telephone conversation .
" he -lrb- lula -rrb- said to me that he would equally receive the german chancellor .
and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know , some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones .

eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .

the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .
insults traded in run-up to summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez accuses merkel of " throwing stones " merkel last week said " chavez is not the voice of latin america , " and urged the countries in the region to distance themselves from him .
chavez responded by saying merkel " is from the german right , the same movement that supported hitler and the same movement that supported fascism . "
then on wednesday , chavez accused merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones , " continuing a war of words .
on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .

meanwhile personal , political and ideological splits are on the unofficial agenda . it may well be that no big decisions will be made at the summit .
however , the idea of a gathering under the slogan " addressing our peoples ' priorities together " is to press forward on issues of common interest , like battles against poverty and climate change .
and with 60 world leaders - nearly one-third of the number of countries in the un - gathered at one place , eu officials have high hopes for at least one issue : climate change .
the european commissioners for trade and external relations , peter mandelson and benita ferrero-waldner , say they are set to present a plan in the peruvian capital for the fight against global warming in latin america which they hope will get the enthusiastic support of countries like brazil , argentina and mexico .
" euroclima " seeks to identify strengths and weaknesses in the fight against climate change across the region , and to " coordinate regional actions in progress , and increase their efficiency and impact , " the officials said .
ferrero-waldner said she hopes the initiative can help latin america and the caribbean face the challenge , and also pointed to the rise in poverty as one of the most evident consequences of climate change around the planet .
in lima , brussels hopes that the three communities can act jointly to become " a world-steering force . "
nations to take sides over biofuels argument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel fans : brazil 's lula , the eu 's barroso , portugal 's socrates but while the eu will be hoping for progress on climate change , a bitter debate over biofuels , blamed by critics for high global food prices and deforestation , threatens to dominate the meeting and highlight strong differences of opinion .
on one side is the eu and brazil , the world 's largest ethanol exporter , which say biofuels can help curb reliance on oil and reduce greenhouse gases .
but many latin american presidents - including leftists like venezuela 's hugo chavez and even free-market enthusiasts like peru 's alan garcia - complain biofuels are forcing up prices for corn , rice and wheat in the region and could push millions of people into deeper poverty .
" i have no doubt that the theme of food will be central to the debates of the summit , " peru 's foreign minister jose garcia belaunde said ahead of the meeting on friday .
" it 's an issue that has become particularly serious . "
disagreements over biofuels could divide even ideological allies at the summit .
experts say the global food crisis has been caused by the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuels , bad weather , surging consumption in fast-growing developing countries and higher fuel costs .
some critics say the eu should scrap its target to have biofuels make up 10 percent of road transportation fuels by 2020 , fearing the goal will contribute to social problems and the plowing of sensitive ecosystems around the world to make room for crops that can be turned into biofuels .
even as many poor countries shy away from biofuels , they are increasingly worried about global warming and say richer countries must do more to cut carbon emissions .
glaciers in the andes mountains are rapidly melting ; meaning that irrigated cropland on peru 's desert coast may eventually dry out . a severe drought in the amazon rainforest in 2005 was another warning sign that global warming could damage one of the earth 's largest carbon sinks .
social issues feature high on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur members : lula , chavez , uribe the eu is also likely to champion social issues at the summit but finance and trade are also on the agenda , in particular commercial agreements that parties have been seeking for years .
eu trade commissioner mandelson hopes the lima summit will speed up progress in the association agreements for political dialogue , cooperation and free trade that the eu is currently negotiating with the andean community of nations and with central america .
negotiations with mercosur , the south american bloc which includes brazil and argentina , among others , remain frozen , as mandelson himself stressed , until the conclusion of the controversial doha round of talks at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
mandelson underlined the importance of such agreements at a time of global economic uncertainty , and said he hopes they will become concrete around 2009 .
based on the experience of the four previous eu-lac summits - rio 1999 , madrid 2002 , guadalajara 2004 and vienna 2006 - brussels can expect little more than rhetoric from the lima gathering .
however , the eu still insists that such a summit is indeed useful .
according to commissioner ferrero-waldner , it is difficult to get such high-level debate except at summits , and it then allows ministers and other officials to follow up with the real work later .
chavez vs. merkel : the next round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row between merkel and chavez could escalate the unpredictability of the political outcomes is coupled with the potential personal clashes which could feature at the summit after a build-up marked by a fair amount of mud-slinging .
the attendance of venezuelan president hugo chavez will surely guarantee that this animosity will continue , especially after a second round of insults traded with german chancellor angela merkel .
he is expected in lima on thursday evening after his attendance was shrouded in doubt .
chavez , battling accusations from his us-backed neighbor colombia that he sought to arm the marxist guerrilla group farc and still smarting from being told to shut up by spain 's king juan carlos at a summit in november , had cast doubt on whether he will attend .
but the chill could run deeper between chavez and merkel in the light of their ongoing war of words .

publishing details of the latest nfi sweep , the auditor-general for wales said public sector fraud had rocketed .
in cardiff alone , cross-checking council tax discounts with the electoral roll identified attempts to defraud the public purse by £ 2.5m.

mature student lindy davies has used the wooden boat for her installation art called the broken -lrb- redemption -rrb- .
the mother-of-two , 38 , has more than a passing connection with the boat - her father-in-law bought it many years ago .
but it broke up as it was being moved and lay rotting until mrs davies decided to sculpt it into modern art .
" this beautifully-crafted wooden boat was built in 1889 and , like many others , would have rotted away on the river bank if my father-in-law had n't bought it in a bidding war , " she said .
" for the graduate show i 've cut the boat into four and suspended huge sail-shaped mirrors above each one , so that people can walk down the centre and experience the look and feel of this part of newport 's history . "
the cariad before she could start work on her art , the boat had to be emptied of around a tonne of silt and bits of wood and then hauled up the riverbank .
final touches to the unusual installation will be made on monday and the work will form part of an exhibition by students from newport school of art , media and design .
lindy davies , who has documented the creation of her installation , and now hopes to turn that into a book , believes the cutter was the last to be built at the gaskell street docks in newport .
" we believe it may have been called the cariad , -lrb- sweetheart -rrb- but we 're not sure and i 'd like anyone who has any relevant information to get in touch , " she said .
mrs davies , who has been supported by her husband kevin and two sons , david and rhys , through six years of art studies , would also like the installation to feature as part of the city 's regeneration .
" i think it would be great to have a symbol of the city 's past linked to its future , " she said .
another graduating artist has painted a series of self portraits , called newport bus station , which is due to be demolished .
emma henley , who has created the bus station art , said : " i 've painted these as a memorial to the bus station ... it 's a special place that 's always meant a lot to me , somewhere to meet friends and begin and end journeys . • the newport school of art , media and design students will stage their show at the caerleon campus of the university of wales from 30 may to 6 june .

it announced profits for the year to 31 march of £ 883m -lrb- $ 1.72bn -rrb- , up 45 % on the previous 12 months .
but this result only tells a fraction of the story about the turbulence affecting ba and the problems it faces in the future .
march 's bungled opening of terminal 5 at heathrow was an acute embarrassment for the firm , for which two of its senior executives have since paid with their jobs .
chief executive willie walsh took personal responsibility for the costly fiasco , which forced ba to delay the transfer of the bulk of its long haul flights from terminals 4 to 5 until june .
mr walsh has insisted the " buck stops with him " and is now under extreme pressure to ensure there are no more problems at the new £ 4.3bn terminal , and to make sure customer confidence in the airline - severely damaged by the baggage chaos at t5 - is gradually rebuilt .
this tough firefighting job is taking place in an increasingly hostile economic environment .
fuel for thought the profits ba have been making are the sort most airlines can only dream of , but they are unlikely to mollify analysts who are more worried about the firm 's future .
the airline 's performance in the 2007 calendar year , when the benefits of the weak dollar helped offset rising fuel costs , was undeniably impressive .
but conditions have got much tougher in the past four months , with oil prices spiralling to previously unthinkable levels near $ 130 a barrel .

mr walsh admitted that fares were likely to rise in the near future as the airline sought to recover some of its increased expenditure on fuel .
" the era of very low fares is behind us , " he told the bbc .
" fuel prices remain at record levels and there are no signs of these reducing . "
" it is clear that there are many airlines out there which are struggling today to survive with oil prices the way they are . "
all this at a time when a likely us recession and consequent global economic slowdown is forcing people to tighten their belts and hitting demand for long haul travel .
" it is all about the outlook , " says stephen furlong , an analyst with investment firm davy , about the importance of the firm 's prospects going forward .
" willie walsh can hardly be blamed for the oil price .
the question is whether ba can make any profit at current prices . "
irrespective of ba 's financial position , the harsh media glare will remain on mr walsh ahead of what is bound to be a difficult summer .
t5 legacy ba will only begin the move from terminal 4 to terminal 5 in june , and speculation has increased about mr walsh 's own position after it emerged that the new chief operating officer ba is currently recruiting may one day be considered for the top job .
the departures of operations director gareth kirkwood and customer services director david noyes last month may have bought mr walsh some time after the torrent of criticism over t5 , but he knows that any more mistakes could prove irrecoverable .
the delay to long haul services moving to terminal 5 angered other airlines davy 's stephen furlong says he expects mr walsh to still be in his job in a year 's time although the ba boss is in a " difficult situation " .
" willie walsh was liked by shareholders before the t5 debacle , " he says .
" the t5 thing will blow over if it starts to work , but if something else happens down the road , people who gave him the benefit of the doubt now probably wo n't . "
the ba hot seat is one of the hottest in british business as bob ayling , who was forced out in 2000 after the firm 's profits fell sharply , can testify .
mr walsh , who took the top job in 2005 , has withstood a series of problems including a damaging strike by baggage handlers , the fallout from the 2006 bomb scares , a price-fixing scandal and fog-induced chaos at heathrow .
bonus calculations an early indication of continuing shareholder backing for mr walsh is related to the controversial question of whether he should be paid a bonus .
mr walsh was entitled to a maximum bonus equal to his basic salary - currently £ 700,000 - after meeting performance targets in the year to 31 march .
the criteria included achieving specified profit margins and delivering on customer satisfaction , punctuality and employee involvement .
many ba staff were unfamiliar with terminal 5 before it opened but he has opted to waive the bonus following the t5 move , which was a public relations disaster for ba - even though it took place only three days before the end of the past financial year on 31 march and had a limited impact on the firm 's trading performance .
although mr walsh said his decision was not influenced by the possibility of a media and public backlash , the move is likely to be seen as a shrewd one .
from his days as head of irish carrier aer lingus , mr walsh has cultivated an image as a tough , no-nonsense operator .

he said he was prepared to deal with historic inequality in pay , affecting as many as 9,000 workers .
the problem dates back 38 years , during which historically 60 % of catholics and two-thirds of women were predominant in the lower pay scales .
he has told officials to look at the scope of the problem and engage with trade unions to resolve the issue .
mr robinson said there may be serious financial implications " but i am not prepared to follow the actions of people who preceded me and leave it unresolved " .
" there should be equal pay for equal work of equal value . "
up to £ 20,000 the move will affect about 9,000 civil servants in the lowest grades , mostly in secretarial and administrative posts .
more than 60 % of civil servants employed at the aa and ao grades are from a catholic background .
workers who have retired from the civil service in the past six years could be entitled to the back-pay , which could be up to £ 20,000 .
the finance minister said the executive could either approach the treasury or find the money from last year 's underspend in northern ireland .
" direct rule ministers did not want to touch this issue because of the enormous amount of calculations and difficulties , " he said .
john corey of public service union nipsa said they had long-standing claims for equal pay , " particularly for our members in the lowest-paid grades " .
he said the union had last year begun an industrial tribunal process to ensure his members received their legal rights under equal pay legislation .
