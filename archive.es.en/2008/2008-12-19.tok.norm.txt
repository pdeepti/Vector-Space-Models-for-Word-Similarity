" when a person representing our country - or , in fact , when anyone is attacked by a right wing extremist , it is an attack on us all , " merkel told the passauer neuen presse newspaper on thursday , dec 18 .
the stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl on saturday as he opened his front door to a skinhead came as a shock to many and is thought to have been the work of neo-nazis .

she called for cities and states across germany to rise to the challenge these groups pose , not only politically but also within society as a whole .
her statement comes as others have called to outlaw germany 's main far right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a newspaper interview wednesday , however , that she did not believe there was sufficient evidence to mount a new legal challenge against the npd .
suspect still sought as chief leaves hospital nearly a week after the stabbing , mannichl has been cleared for release from the hospital .
while two alleged accomplices were arrested wednesday , the police are still searching for the man thought to be responsible .
" we ca n't let ourselved be afraid of these right-wing extremists , " mannichl said in a short statement to the press where he thanked the public for its support , adding that the attempt on his life was " cowardly . " police this week picked up a 33-year-old man and 22-year-old woman who are suspected of helping the attacker . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .
or if he deported prisoners , who are proven innocent , to countries where they are threatened with imprisonment or torture . germany must step up this is where countries such as germany and other eu nations should take responsibility and offer refuge to groups such as the small number of uighurs held at guantanamo bay - a muslim minority that faces persecution in china .
the military trials should also be replaced by proper legal proceedings in us civilian courts - a right that america 's highest court upheld for guantanamo prisoners in a ruling more than two years ago . complicated decisions barack obama 's legal advisors face complicated decisions that involve balancing national security imperatives with the principles of a constitutional state .
fighting terrorism can no longer involve psychological torture and law-free zones .

" it has become a technology battle which even overshadows the doping debate .
that is a wrong turn for the sport , " gross told german news agency dpa .
" swimming is risking maneuvering itself on to the sidelines . "
gross called for a return to " swim shorts and suits " or at least for a standard suit to be used by all athletes .
at the heart of the debate are hi-tech racing suits manufactured by swimwear makers such as adidas and speedo .
the suits are made from an ultra-lightweight fabric designed to minimize drag , repel water and reduce muscle oscillation and skin vibration .
some suits even come equipped with an internal core stabilizer to hold the swimmer in a corset-like grip to maintain the best body position in the water .

but the worst thing is that the kick is slowly gone for the swimmers as well , the motto being ' i can try whatever i want , it is the suit that wins . " '

" all the states will approve a second package in january , " merkel told a press conference in berlin . they will all " contribute to the extra investment , " she said , adding that the infrastructure package aimed at streets , rail tracks , schools and kindergartens is made up of " projects that will modernize our country for the long term . " berlin has already laid out a package worth 31 billion euros to fight a recession triggered by the global credit crunch , but merkel has been accused of timidity as european neighbors lay out plans for even more public spending to kick-start their troubled economies . build , do n't bail out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrueck are against tax cuts and for infrastructure projects merkel has committed herself to infrastructure spending , arguing that it is a surer way of stimulating the economy than giving tax handouts .
she says germans are more likely to hoard handouts as savings , and not spend them to help keep the economy afloat . but her stance on that issue has also come under fierce criticism internationally .
other governments say it is important to boost consumer spending as well as public investment . press reports have suggested that berlin is now preparing to invest another 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- to pull the german economy out of recession , or at least help it weather the worst of the storm . but merkel has said the plan will only be unveiled after us president-elect barack obama takes office january 20 and puts forward similar measures . shift in priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive investment has been focused on the east , but that will change merkel , who wants new public investments in infrastructure and transportation , said thursday all the federal states would benefit from the next package .
but eastern germany will not , as previously , be given priority , she warned . after nearly 20 years of heavy public spending to help rebuild germany 's former communist eastern regions , " there 's now a backlog of need " in western germany , merkel had said in an interview published thursday in the political magazine cicero . the interview sparked controversy , since it has been an unwritten rule in german politics to avoid comparing 1970s and 1980s facilities in the western region with the east 's fast roads , restored town centers and new industrial areas that have all benefited from 19 years of massive federal spending .
more than one trillion dollars have been transferred from west to east . however , former east germany still suffers from poverty , under-investment and high levels of unemployment . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he had previously been denied parole , with a stuttgart court ruling in 1998 that he needed to complete at least that much of his sentence .
one of the leading figures of the second generation of the left-wing group raf , klar was sentenced for his role in the kidnapping and murder of industry representative hanns martin schleyer as well as the murders of federal prosecutor siegfried buback and dresdner bank ceo juergen ponto .
he has not indicated remorse for the nine murders he was tried for and it remains unclear what his exact role was in those killings .
klar has continued to observe a vow of silence taken among the group 's members , refusing to disclose which of the masked figures committed the most brutal murders .
judges , however , have ruled that he no longer presents a danger to society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar was convicted of nine murders , some including high-profile victims victims outraged at release some survivors of the raf 's brutalities said last month they were angry that life imprisonment did not mean the full term of klar 's life .
" it is intolerable that a violent criminal who caused people such immeasurable pain and has never distanced himself from his grave crimes will soon be given freedom , " hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , said after learning of klar 's impending release .
judges said in november that klar , who served longer in jail than any other raf member , should be freed on or around january 3 , 2009 .
possibly to thwart media attention , the precise date was not announced in advance .
second last raf member to leave jail heinz-juergen schneider , his lawyer , said klar had left the jail during the morning and would not be giving any interviews .
" he is going to decide himself what he will be doing and where , " said schneider .
there is only one raf member still in jail : birgit hogefeld , 52 .
she was a third-generation leader of the violent communist group , which dissolved itself in 1998 .

" all the states will approve a second package in january , " merkel told a press conference in berlin . they will all " contribute to the extra investment , " she said , adding that the infrastructure package aimed at streets , rail tracks , schools and kindergartens is made up of " projects that will modernize our country for the long term . " berlin has already laid out a package worth 31 billion euros to fight a recession triggered by the global credit crunch , but merkel has been accused of timidity as european neighbors lay out plans for even more public spending to kick-start their troubled economies . build , do n't bail out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrueck are against tax cuts and for infrastructure projects merkel has committed herself to infrastructure spending , arguing that it is a surer way of stimulating the economy than giving tax handouts .

" it has become a technology battle which even overshadows the doping debate .
that is a wrong turn for the sport , " gross told german news agency dpa .
" swimming is risking maneuvering itself on to the sidelines . "
gross called for a return to " swim shorts and suits " or at least for a standard suit to be used by all athletes .
at the heart of the debate are hi-tech racing suits manufactured by swimwear makers such as adidas and speedo .
the suits are made from an ultra-lightweight fabric designed to minimize drag , repel water and reduce muscle oscillation and skin vibration .
some suits even come equipped with an internal core stabilizer to hold the swimmer in a corset-like grip to maintain the best body position in the water .
suits reap records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streamline racing suits helped propel michael phelps to a record medal haul in beijing gross won three olympic gold medals and five world titles in his career in the 1980s - long before such bodysuits were introduced .
" i am glad that we did n't have this discussion during my days .
but the worst thing is that the kick is slowly gone for the swimmers as well , the motto being ' i can try whatever i want , it is the suit that wins . " '
new racing suits released this year led to more than 100 world records .
swimming reached a milestone at the beijing olympics when american michael phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals at one games for an all-time record of 14 golds .
last weekend , german swimmers protested against their allegedly inferior equipment which prompted equipment makers adidas to cancel a sponsorship deal with the nation 's swim federation . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say it infringes on people 's civil liberties . the upper house , the bundesrat , approved the bill by a vote of 35-34 , a day after the lower house backed the new version .
mediation by a committee of both chambers of parliament was necessary to reach the decision .
the new law reforms the federal police and give authorities powers to break into personal computers during preventive inquiries into terrorism and other serious crime .
after initially being approved by the lower house or bundestag it was rejected at the end of november by the bundesrat , which represents 16 state governments .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble welcomed the bill , saying it gave the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- the powers to conduct preventive measures necessary " to combat international terrorism successfully . " the revised bill requires a judge to authorize police access to a suspect 's personal computer and to oversee the search of data by law enforcement officers . it also clarifies the jurisdiction for such searches between the federal government and state authorities .
police have been studying whether they could either enter premises to plant monitoring devices in computers or send viruses to the computers via the internet so that investigators could covertly read the hard disks .
betraying privacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyers and journalists fear that someone will always be listening legislators , clergymen and defense lawyers are fully protected from such searches , but journalists , other lawyers and doctors are not .
ulrich schellenberg , a lawyer and board member at the german bar association , told deutsche welle that this differentiation is unfair .
" just as clergy members deal with people 's religious conflicts , lawyers are obligated deal with moral conflicts , " he said .
" we talk to people who have problems and they need to talk to someone they know they can trust . "
michael konken , chairman of the german journalists association has called the bill a " farce . " " we are worried in the editorial department , because people no longer know what they should do with their information , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .

critics say it infringes on people 's civil liberties . the upper house , the bundesrat , approved the bill by a vote of 35-34 , a day after the lower house backed the new version .
mediation by a committee of both chambers of parliament was necessary to reach the decision .
the new law reforms the federal police and give authorities powers to break into personal computers during preventive inquiries into terrorism and other serious crime .
after initially being approved by the lower house or bundestag it was rejected at the end of november by the bundesrat , which represents 16 state governments .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble welcomed the bill , saying it gave the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- the powers to conduct preventive measures necessary " to combat international terrorism successfully . " the revised bill requires a judge to authorize police access to a suspect 's personal computer and to oversee the search of data by law enforcement officers . it also clarifies the jurisdiction for such searches between the federal government and state authorities .
police have been studying whether they could either enter premises to plant monitoring devices in computers or send viruses to the computers via the internet so that investigators could covertly read the hard disks .
betraying privacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyers and journalists fear that someone will always be listening legislators , clergymen and defense lawyers are fully protected from such searches , but journalists , other lawyers and doctors are not .
ulrich schellenberg , a lawyer and board member at the german bar association , told deutsche welle that this differentiation is unfair .
" just as clergy members deal with people 's religious conflicts , lawyers are obligated deal with moral conflicts , " he said .
" we talk to people who have problems and they need to talk to someone they know they can trust . "
michael konken , chairman of the german journalists association has called the bill a " farce . " " we are worried in the editorial department , because people no longer know what they should do with their information , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he had previously been denied parole , with a stuttgart court ruling in 1998 that he needed to complete at least that much of his sentence .

" our demands are specified from the beginning , and no other demands are added , " he said . the armed men , from the bani dhabian tribe in the west of the arab peninsula nation , had originally demanded the release of two relatives jailed in the yemeni capital , sana 'a , over a previous kidnapping of five local engineers last year . the chief tribesman had also insisted authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tribesman have called for the release by the us of sheikh mohammed ali al-moayad the two detained yemenis , who the kidnappers reportedly wanted released , hail from the same tribe as the kidnappers and were charged with giving financial support to al-qaeda and the palestinian group hamas . they were arrested in germany in 2003 and extradited to the united states where they were both initially dealt hefty prison terms .

" all the states will approve a second package in january , " merkel told a press conference in berlin . they will all " contribute to the extra investment , " she said , adding that the infrastructure package aimed at streets , rail tracks , schools and kindergartens is made up of " projects that will modernize our country for the long term . " berlin has already laid out a package worth 31 billion euros to fight a recession triggered by the global credit crunch , but merkel has been accused of timidity as european neighbors lay out plans for even more public spending to kick-start their troubled economies . build , do n't bail out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrueck are against tax cuts and for infrastructure projects merkel has committed herself to infrastructure spending , arguing that it is a surer way of stimulating the economy than giving tax handouts .
she says germans are more likely to hoard handouts as savings , and not spend them to help keep the economy afloat . but her stance on that issue has also come under fierce criticism internationally .
other governments say it is important to boost consumer spending as well as public investment . press reports have suggested that berlin is now preparing to invest another 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- to pull the german economy out of recession , or at least help it weather the worst of the storm . but merkel has said the plan will only be unveiled after us president-elect barack obama takes office january 20 and puts forward similar measures . shift in priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive investment has been focused on the east , but that will change merkel , who wants new public investments in infrastructure and transportation , said thursday all the federal states would benefit from the next package .
but eastern germany will not , as previously , be given priority , she warned . after nearly 20 years of heavy public spending to help rebuild germany 's former communist eastern regions , " there 's now a backlog of need " in western germany , merkel had said in an interview published thursday in the political magazine cicero . the interview sparked controversy , since it has been an unwritten rule in german politics to avoid comparing 1970s and 1980s facilities in the western region with the east 's fast roads , restored town centers and new industrial areas that have all benefited from 19 years of massive federal spending .
more than one trillion dollars have been transferred from west to east . however , former east germany still suffers from poverty , under-investment and high levels of unemployment . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl on saturday as he opened his front door to a skinhead came as a shock to many and is thought to have been the work of neo-nazis .

she called for cities and states across germany to rise to the challenge these groups pose , not only politically but also within society as a whole .
her statement comes as others have called to outlaw germany 's main far right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a newspaper interview wednesday , however , that she did not believe there was sufficient evidence to mount a new legal challenge against the npd .

while two alleged accomplices were arrested wednesday , the police are still searching for the man thought to be responsible .
" we ca n't let ourselved be afraid of these right-wing extremists , " mannichl said in a short statement to the press where he thanked the public for its support , adding that the attempt on his life was " cowardly . " police this week picked up a 33-year-old man and 22-year-old woman who are suspected of helping the attacker . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it has become a technology battle which even overshadows the doping debate .
that is a wrong turn for the sport , " gross told german news agency dpa .
" swimming is risking maneuvering itself on to the sidelines . "
gross called for a return to " swim shorts and suits " or at least for a standard suit to be used by all athletes .
at the heart of the debate are hi-tech racing suits manufactured by swimwear makers such as adidas and speedo .
the suits are made from an ultra-lightweight fabric designed to minimize drag , repel water and reduce muscle oscillation and skin vibration .
some suits even come equipped with an internal core stabilizer to hold the swimmer in a corset-like grip to maintain the best body position in the water .
suits reap records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streamline racing suits helped propel michael phelps to a record medal haul in beijing gross won three olympic gold medals and five world titles in his career in the 1980s - long before such bodysuits were introduced .
" i am glad that we did n't have this discussion during my days .
but the worst thing is that the kick is slowly gone for the swimmers as well , the motto being ' i can try whatever i want , it is the suit that wins . " '
new racing suits released this year led to more than 100 world records .
swimming reached a milestone at the beijing olympics when american michael phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals at one games for an all-time record of 14 golds .
last weekend , german swimmers protested against their allegedly inferior equipment which prompted equipment makers adidas to cancel a sponsorship deal with the nation 's swim federation . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the leading figures of the second generation of the left-wing group raf , klar was sentenced for his role in the kidnapping and murder of industry representative hanns martin schleyer as well as the murders of federal prosecutor siegfried buback and dresdner bank ceo juergen ponto .
he has not indicated remorse for the nine murders he was tried for and it remains unclear what his exact role was in those killings .

judges said in november that klar , who served longer in jail than any other raf member , should be freed on or around january 3 , 2009 .
possibly to thwart media attention , the precise date was not announced in advance .
second last raf member to leave jail heinz-juergen schneider , his lawyer , said klar had left the jail during the morning and would not be giving any interviews .
" he is going to decide himself what he will be doing and where , " said schneider .
there is only one raf member still in jail : birgit hogefeld , 52 .
she was a third-generation leader of the violent communist group , which dissolved itself in 1998 .

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .

if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .

the military trials should also be replaced by proper legal proceedings in us civilian courts - a right that america 's highest court upheld for guantanamo prisoners in a ruling more than two years ago . complicated decisions barack obama 's legal advisors face complicated decisions that involve balancing national security imperatives with the principles of a constitutional state .

critics say it infringes on people 's civil liberties . the upper house , the bundesrat , approved the bill by a vote of 35-34 , a day after the lower house backed the new version .
mediation by a committee of both chambers of parliament was necessary to reach the decision .
the new law reforms the federal police and give authorities powers to break into personal computers during preventive inquiries into terrorism and other serious crime .
after initially being approved by the lower house or bundestag it was rejected at the end of november by the bundesrat , which represents 16 state governments .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble welcomed the bill , saying it gave the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- the powers to conduct preventive measures necessary " to combat international terrorism successfully . " the revised bill requires a judge to authorize police access to a suspect 's personal computer and to oversee the search of data by law enforcement officers . it also clarifies the jurisdiction for such searches between the federal government and state authorities .
police have been studying whether they could either enter premises to plant monitoring devices in computers or send viruses to the computers via the internet so that investigators could covertly read the hard disks .
betraying privacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyers and journalists fear that someone will always be listening legislators , clergymen and defense lawyers are fully protected from such searches , but journalists , other lawyers and doctors are not .
ulrich schellenberg , a lawyer and board member at the german bar association , told deutsche welle that this differentiation is unfair .
" just as clergy members deal with people 's religious conflicts , lawyers are obligated deal with moral conflicts , " he said .
" we talk to people who have problems and they need to talk to someone they know they can trust . "
michael konken , chairman of the german journalists association has called the bill a " farce . " " we are worried in the editorial department , because people no longer know what they should do with their information , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it has become a technology battle which even overshadows the doping debate .
that is a wrong turn for the sport , " gross told german news agency dpa .
" swimming is risking maneuvering itself on to the sidelines . "
gross called for a return to " swim shorts and suits " or at least for a standard suit to be used by all athletes .
at the heart of the debate are hi-tech racing suits manufactured by swimwear makers such as adidas and speedo .
the suits are made from an ultra-lightweight fabric designed to minimize drag , repel water and reduce muscle oscillation and skin vibration .
some suits even come equipped with an internal core stabilizer to hold the swimmer in a corset-like grip to maintain the best body position in the water .

but the worst thing is that the kick is slowly gone for the swimmers as well , the motto being ' i can try whatever i want , it is the suit that wins . " '
new racing suits released this year led to more than 100 world records .
swimming reached a milestone at the beijing olympics when american michael phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals at one games for an all-time record of 14 golds .

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .
or if he deported prisoners , who are proven innocent , to countries where they are threatened with imprisonment or torture . germany must step up this is where countries such as germany and other eu nations should take responsibility and offer refuge to groups such as the small number of uighurs held at guantanamo bay - a muslim minority that faces persecution in china .
the military trials should also be replaced by proper legal proceedings in us civilian courts - a right that america 's highest court upheld for guantanamo prisoners in a ruling more than two years ago . complicated decisions barack obama 's legal advisors face complicated decisions that involve balancing national security imperatives with the principles of a constitutional state .
fighting terrorism can no longer involve psychological torture and law-free zones .
it 's only then that the us can be led back permanently on the track to upholding the rule of law after years of understandably straying from it . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when a person representing our country - or , in fact , when anyone is attacked by a right wing extremist , it is an attack on us all , " merkel told the passauer neuen presse newspaper on thursday , dec 18 .
the stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl on saturday as he opened his front door to a skinhead came as a shock to many and is thought to have been the work of neo-nazis .
the perpetrator is alleged to have told the chief : " greetings from the national resistance , " during the attack , a reference to germany 's right-wing community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite serious injuries , mannichl was able to leave the hospital friday in her first interview about the stabbing , merkel said that with a shift to violent tactics , the threat posed by right-wing extremists must be taken very seriously .
she called for cities and states across germany to rise to the challenge these groups pose , not only politically but also within society as a whole .
her statement comes as others have called to outlaw germany 's main far right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a newspaper interview wednesday , however , that she did not believe there was sufficient evidence to mount a new legal challenge against the npd .
suspect still sought as chief leaves hospital nearly a week after the stabbing , mannichl has been cleared for release from the hospital .
while two alleged accomplices were arrested wednesday , the police are still searching for the man thought to be responsible .
" we ca n't let ourselved be afraid of these right-wing extremists , " mannichl said in a short statement to the press where he thanked the public for its support , adding that the attempt on his life was " cowardly .

the stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl on saturday as he opened his front door to a skinhead came as a shock to many and is thought to have been the work of neo-nazis .

while two alleged accomplices were arrested wednesday , the police are still searching for the man thought to be responsible .

" all the states will approve a second package in january , " merkel told a press conference in berlin . they will all " contribute to the extra investment , " she said , adding that the infrastructure package aimed at streets , rail tracks , schools and kindergartens is made up of " projects that will modernize our country for the long term .

other governments say it is important to boost consumer spending as well as public investment . press reports have suggested that berlin is now preparing to invest another 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- to pull the german economy out of recession , or at least help it weather the worst of the storm . but merkel has said the plan will only be unveiled after us president-elect barack obama takes office january 20 and puts forward similar measures . shift in priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive investment has been focused on the east , but that will change merkel , who wants new public investments in infrastructure and transportation , said thursday all the federal states would benefit from the next package .
but eastern germany will not , as previously , be given priority , she warned . after nearly 20 years of heavy public spending to help rebuild germany 's former communist eastern regions , " there 's now a backlog of need " in western germany , merkel had said in an interview published thursday in the political magazine cicero . the interview sparked controversy , since it has been an unwritten rule in german politics to avoid comparing 1970s and 1980s facilities in the western region with the east 's fast roads , restored town centers and new industrial areas that have all benefited from 19 years of massive federal spending .

critics say it infringes on people 's civil liberties . the upper house , the bundesrat , approved the bill by a vote of 35-34 , a day after the lower house backed the new version .
mediation by a committee of both chambers of parliament was necessary to reach the decision .
the new law reforms the federal police and give authorities powers to break into personal computers during preventive inquiries into terrorism and other serious crime .
after initially being approved by the lower house or bundestag it was rejected at the end of november by the bundesrat , which represents 16 state governments .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble welcomed the bill , saying it gave the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- the powers to conduct preventive measures necessary " to combat international terrorism successfully . " the revised bill requires a judge to authorize police access to a suspect 's personal computer and to oversee the search of data by law enforcement officers . it also clarifies the jurisdiction for such searches between the federal government and state authorities .
police have been studying whether they could either enter premises to plant monitoring devices in computers or send viruses to the computers via the internet so that investigators could covertly read the hard disks .
betraying privacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyers and journalists fear that someone will always be listening legislators , clergymen and defense lawyers are fully protected from such searches , but journalists , other lawyers and doctors are not .
ulrich schellenberg , a lawyer and board member at the german bar association , told deutsche welle that this differentiation is unfair .
" just as clergy members deal with people 's religious conflicts , lawyers are obligated deal with moral conflicts , " he said .
" we talk to people who have problems and they need to talk to someone they know they can trust . "
michael konken , chairman of the german journalists association has called the bill a " farce . " " we are worried in the editorial department , because people no longer know what they should do with their information , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .
or if he deported prisoners , who are proven innocent , to countries where they are threatened with imprisonment or torture . germany must step up this is where countries such as germany and other eu nations should take responsibility and offer refuge to groups such as the small number of uighurs held at guantanamo bay - a muslim minority that faces persecution in china .
the military trials should also be replaced by proper legal proceedings in us civilian courts - a right that america 's highest court upheld for guantanamo prisoners in a ruling more than two years ago . complicated decisions barack obama 's legal advisors face complicated decisions that involve balancing national security imperatives with the principles of a constitutional state .
fighting terrorism can no longer involve psychological torture and law-free zones .
it 's only then that the us can be led back permanently on the track to upholding the rule of law after years of understandably straying from it . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .
or if he deported prisoners , who are proven innocent , to countries where they are threatened with imprisonment or torture . germany must step up this is where countries such as germany and other eu nations should take responsibility and offer refuge to groups such as the small number of uighurs held at guantanamo bay - a muslim minority that faces persecution in china .
the military trials should also be replaced by proper legal proceedings in us civilian courts - a right that america 's highest court upheld for guantanamo prisoners in a ruling more than two years ago . complicated decisions barack obama 's legal advisors face complicated decisions that involve balancing national security imperatives with the principles of a constitutional state .
fighting terrorism can no longer involve psychological torture and law-free zones .
it 's only then that the us can be led back permanently on the track to upholding the rule of law after years of understandably straying from it . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the leading figures of the second generation of the left-wing group raf , klar was sentenced for his role in the kidnapping and murder of industry representative hanns martin schleyer as well as the murders of federal prosecutor siegfried buback and dresdner bank ceo juergen ponto .

judges said in november that klar , who served longer in jail than any other raf member , should be freed on or around january 3 , 2009 .

second last raf member to leave jail heinz-juergen schneider , his lawyer , said klar had left the jail during the morning and would not be giving any interviews .
" he is going to decide himself what he will be doing and where , " said schneider .

" it has become a technology battle which even overshadows the doping debate .
that is a wrong turn for the sport , " gross told german news agency dpa .
" swimming is risking maneuvering itself on to the sidelines . "
gross called for a return to " swim shorts and suits " or at least for a standard suit to be used by all athletes .
at the heart of the debate are hi-tech racing suits manufactured by swimwear makers such as adidas and speedo .
the suits are made from an ultra-lightweight fabric designed to minimize drag , repel water and reduce muscle oscillation and skin vibration .
some suits even come equipped with an internal core stabilizer to hold the swimmer in a corset-like grip to maintain the best body position in the water .
suits reap records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streamline racing suits helped propel michael phelps to a record medal haul in beijing gross won three olympic gold medals and five world titles in his career in the 1980s - long before such bodysuits were introduced .
" i am glad that we did n't have this discussion during my days .
but the worst thing is that the kick is slowly gone for the swimmers as well , the motto being ' i can try whatever i want , it is the suit that wins . " '
new racing suits released this year led to more than 100 world records .
swimming reached a milestone at the beijing olympics when american michael phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals at one games for an all-time record of 14 golds .
last weekend , german swimmers protested against their allegedly inferior equipment which prompted equipment makers adidas to cancel a sponsorship deal with the nation 's swim federation . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hostages arrived at the sana 'a headquarters of the interior ministry , where they met with interior minister mutahar al-masri , tourism minister nabeel al-faqih and the german deputy ambassador .
the three - a german woman working for the german technical cooperation agency -lrb- gtz -rrb- as well as her father and mother who were visiting - were taken hostage on sunday , december 15 in the bani dhabyan region some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- east of the capital sanaa .

al-dharehi told dpa that al-moayyad 's family and supporters " use only legal and peaceful means " to secure his release .

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .

he had previously been denied parole , with a stuttgart court ruling in 1998 that he needed to complete at least that much of his sentence .
one of the leading figures of the second generation of the left-wing group raf , klar was sentenced for his role in the kidnapping and murder of industry representative hanns martin schleyer as well as the murders of federal prosecutor siegfried buback and dresdner bank ceo juergen ponto .
he has not indicated remorse for the nine murders he was tried for and it remains unclear what his exact role was in those killings .
klar has continued to observe a vow of silence taken among the group 's members , refusing to disclose which of the masked figures committed the most brutal murders .
judges , however , have ruled that he no longer presents a danger to society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar was convicted of nine murders , some including high-profile victims victims outraged at release some survivors of the raf 's brutalities said last month they were angry that life imprisonment did not mean the full term of klar 's life .
" it is intolerable that a violent criminal who caused people such immeasurable pain and has never distanced himself from his grave crimes will soon be given freedom , " hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , said after learning of klar 's impending release .
judges said in november that klar , who served longer in jail than any other raf member , should be freed on or around january 3 , 2009 .
possibly to thwart media attention , the precise date was not announced in advance .
second last raf member to leave jail heinz-juergen schneider , his lawyer , said klar had left the jail during the morning and would not be giving any interviews .
" he is going to decide himself what he will be doing and where , " said schneider .
there is only one raf member still in jail : birgit hogefeld , 52 .
she was a third-generation leader of the violent communist group , which dissolved itself in 1998 .

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .

" it has become a technology battle which even overshadows the doping debate .
that is a wrong turn for the sport , " gross told german news agency dpa .
" swimming is risking maneuvering itself on to the sidelines . "
gross called for a return to " swim shorts and suits " or at least for a standard suit to be used by all athletes .
at the heart of the debate are hi-tech racing suits manufactured by swimwear makers such as adidas and speedo .
the suits are made from an ultra-lightweight fabric designed to minimize drag , repel water and reduce muscle oscillation and skin vibration .
some suits even come equipped with an internal core stabilizer to hold the swimmer in a corset-like grip to maintain the best body position in the water .
suits reap records bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streamline racing suits helped propel michael phelps to a record medal haul in beijing gross won three olympic gold medals and five world titles in his career in the 1980s - long before such bodysuits were introduced .
" i am glad that we did n't have this discussion during my days .
but the worst thing is that the kick is slowly gone for the swimmers as well , the motto being ' i can try whatever i want , it is the suit that wins . " '
new racing suits released this year led to more than 100 world records .
swimming reached a milestone at the beijing olympics when american michael phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals at one games for an all-time record of 14 golds .
last weekend , german swimmers protested against their allegedly inferior equipment which prompted equipment makers adidas to cancel a sponsorship deal with the nation 's swim federation . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all the states will approve a second package in january , " merkel told a press conference in berlin . they will all " contribute to the extra investment , " she said , adding that the infrastructure package aimed at streets , rail tracks , schools and kindergartens is made up of " projects that will modernize our country for the long term . " berlin has already laid out a package worth 31 billion euros to fight a recession triggered by the global credit crunch , but merkel has been accused of timidity as european neighbors lay out plans for even more public spending to kick-start their troubled economies . build , do n't bail out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrueck are against tax cuts and for infrastructure projects merkel has committed herself to infrastructure spending , arguing that it is a surer way of stimulating the economy than giving tax handouts .
she says germans are more likely to hoard handouts as savings , and not spend them to help keep the economy afloat . but her stance on that issue has also come under fierce criticism internationally .
other governments say it is important to boost consumer spending as well as public investment . press reports have suggested that berlin is now preparing to invest another 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- to pull the german economy out of recession , or at least help it weather the worst of the storm . but merkel has said the plan will only be unveiled after us president-elect barack obama takes office january 20 and puts forward similar measures . shift in priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive investment has been focused on the east , but that will change merkel , who wants new public investments in infrastructure and transportation , said thursday all the federal states would benefit from the next package .
but eastern germany will not , as previously , be given priority , she warned . after nearly 20 years of heavy public spending to help rebuild germany 's former communist eastern regions , " there 's now a backlog of need " in western germany , merkel had said in an interview published thursday in the political magazine cicero . the interview sparked controversy , since it has been an unwritten rule in german politics to avoid comparing 1970s and 1980s facilities in the western region with the east 's fast roads , restored town centers and new industrial areas that have all benefited from 19 years of massive federal spending .
more than one trillion dollars have been transferred from west to east . however , former east germany still suffers from poverty , under-investment and high levels of unemployment . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all the states will approve a second package in january , " merkel told a press conference in berlin . they will all " contribute to the extra investment , " she said , adding that the infrastructure package aimed at streets , rail tracks , schools and kindergartens is made up of " projects that will modernize our country for the long term . " berlin has already laid out a package worth 31 billion euros to fight a recession triggered by the global credit crunch , but merkel has been accused of timidity as european neighbors lay out plans for even more public spending to kick-start their troubled economies . build , do n't bail out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrueck are against tax cuts and for infrastructure projects merkel has committed herself to infrastructure spending , arguing that it is a surer way of stimulating the economy than giving tax handouts .
she says germans are more likely to hoard handouts as savings , and not spend them to help keep the economy afloat . but her stance on that issue has also come under fierce criticism internationally .
other governments say it is important to boost consumer spending as well as public investment . press reports have suggested that berlin is now preparing to invest another 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- to pull the german economy out of recession , or at least help it weather the worst of the storm . but merkel has said the plan will only be unveiled after us president-elect barack obama takes office january 20 and puts forward similar measures . shift in priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive investment has been focused on the east , but that will change merkel , who wants new public investments in infrastructure and transportation , said thursday all the federal states would benefit from the next package .
but eastern germany will not , as previously , be given priority , she warned . after nearly 20 years of heavy public spending to help rebuild germany 's former communist eastern regions , " there 's now a backlog of need " in western germany , merkel had said in an interview published thursday in the political magazine cicero . the interview sparked controversy , since it has been an unwritten rule in german politics to avoid comparing 1970s and 1980s facilities in the western region with the east 's fast roads , restored town centers and new industrial areas that have all benefited from 19 years of massive federal spending .
more than one trillion dollars have been transferred from west to east . however , former east germany still suffers from poverty , under-investment and high levels of unemployment . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the leading figures of the second generation of the left-wing group raf , klar was sentenced for his role in the kidnapping and murder of industry representative hanns martin schleyer as well as the murders of federal prosecutor siegfried buback and dresdner bank ceo juergen ponto .

second last raf member to leave jail heinz-juergen schneider , his lawyer , said klar had left the jail during the morning and would not be giving any interviews .
" he is going to decide himself what he will be doing and where , " said schneider .
there is only one raf member still in jail : birgit hogefeld , 52 .

he had previously been denied parole , with a stuttgart court ruling in 1998 that he needed to complete at least that much of his sentence .
one of the leading figures of the second generation of the left-wing group raf , klar was sentenced for his role in the kidnapping and murder of industry representative hanns martin schleyer as well as the murders of federal prosecutor siegfried buback and dresdner bank ceo juergen ponto .
he has not indicated remorse for the nine murders he was tried for and it remains unclear what his exact role was in those killings .

the hostages arrived at the sana 'a headquarters of the interior ministry , where they met with interior minister mutahar al-masri , tourism minister nabeel al-faqih and the german deputy ambassador .
the three - a german woman working for the german technical cooperation agency -lrb- gtz -rrb- as well as her father and mother who were visiting - were taken hostage on sunday , december 15 in the bani dhabyan region some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- east of the capital sanaa .

steinmeier declined to disclose how the three germans came free or how they would return to germany , saying disclosure was not in their interest .
reports of kidnappers ' demands disputed the release comes five days after the kidnapping and just one day after reports that kidnappers demanded a hostage exchange with two yemeni clerics jailed in the united states on terrorism charges were shot down .
" we were surprised by the reports about demands by the kidnappers for the release of sheikh muhammad al-moayyad and his companion muhammad zayed , " said skeikh hamoud al-dharehi , who heads an ngo dedicated to defending the two clerics .
al-dharehi told dpa that al-moayyad 's family and supporters " use only legal and peaceful means " to secure his release .
" we have no connection to them -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- , " he said .

the hostages arrived at the sana 'a headquarters of the interior ministry , where they met with interior minister mutahar al-masri , tourism minister nabeel al-faqih and the german deputy ambassador .
the three - a german woman working for the german technical cooperation agency -lrb- gtz -rrb- as well as her father and mother who were visiting - were taken hostage on sunday , december 15 in the bani dhabyan region some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- east of the capital sanaa .

steinmeier declined to disclose how the three germans came free or how they would return to germany , saying disclosure was not in their interest .
reports of kidnappers ' demands disputed the release comes five days after the kidnapping and just one day after reports that kidnappers demanded a hostage exchange with two yemeni clerics jailed in the united states on terrorism charges were shot down .
" we were surprised by the reports about demands by the kidnappers for the release of sheikh muhammad al-moayyad and his companion muhammad zayed , " said skeikh hamoud al-dharehi , who heads an ngo dedicated to defending the two clerics .
al-dharehi told dpa that al-moayyad 's family and supporters " use only legal and peaceful means " to secure his release .
" we have no connection to them -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- , " he said .

not just the camp but the entire system which violates international law needs to disappear , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . in the beginning , there were chains and cages which later gave way to a highly sophisticated high security complex .
the prison camp , which prompted outrage among human rights lawyers around the world , systematically circumvented the rule of law for over seven years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz terror suspects in the camp were subjected to questionable interrogation practices in an attempt to force confessions .
if at all charges were brought against a suspect , the trial took place in military courts whose make-up and rules were unworthy of a constitutional country like the us . erasing a stain the guantanamo system , introduced by president george w bush after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan , is now set to end .
the pentagon , which oversees the prison 's functioning , is now preparing for its closure .
that will hopefully permanently erase the blemish on the international reputation of the united states , a country without whom there would be no internationally valid human rights .
it 's also likely to satisfy all democratic countries and their citizens . but a simple announcement to close guantanamo bay is n't enough .
the us government will now have to deal with dismantling the prison camp in such a manner that real terrorists continue to remain in custody and are sentenced according to the rule of law , terror suspects face trial in proper courts and the innocent are released without fearing for their lives . it would be unhelpful if the future president of the united states , barack obama , were simply to rebuild the camp within the borders of the us .
or if he deported prisoners , who are proven innocent , to countries where they are threatened with imprisonment or torture . germany must step up this is where countries such as germany and other eu nations should take responsibility and offer refuge to groups such as the small number of uighurs held at guantanamo bay - a muslim minority that faces persecution in china .
the military trials should also be replaced by proper legal proceedings in us civilian courts - a right that america 's highest court upheld for guantanamo prisoners in a ruling more than two years ago . complicated decisions barack obama 's legal advisors face complicated decisions that involve balancing national security imperatives with the principles of a constitutional state .
fighting terrorism can no longer involve psychological torture and law-free zones .
it 's only then that the us can be led back permanently on the track to upholding the rule of law after years of understandably straying from it . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when a person representing our country - or , in fact , when anyone is attacked by a right wing extremist , it is an attack on us all , " merkel told the passauer neuen presse newspaper on thursday , dec 18 .
the stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl on saturday as he opened his front door to a skinhead came as a shock to many and is thought to have been the work of neo-nazis .
the perpetrator is alleged to have told the chief : " greetings from the national resistance , " during the attack , a reference to germany 's right-wing community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite serious injuries , mannichl was able to leave the hospital friday in her first interview about the stabbing , merkel said that with a shift to violent tactics , the threat posed by right-wing extremists must be taken very seriously .
she called for cities and states across germany to rise to the challenge these groups pose , not only politically but also within society as a whole .
her statement comes as others have called to outlaw germany 's main far right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a newspaper interview wednesday , however , that she did not believe there was sufficient evidence to mount a new legal challenge against the npd .
suspect still sought as chief leaves hospital nearly a week after the stabbing , mannichl has been cleared for release from the hospital .
while two alleged accomplices were arrested wednesday , the police are still searching for the man thought to be responsible .
" we ca n't let ourselved be afraid of these right-wing extremists , " mannichl said in a short statement to the press where he thanked the public for its support , adding that the attempt on his life was " cowardly . " police this week picked up a 33-year-old man and 22-year-old woman who are suspected of helping the attacker . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we never demanded the release of a cleric , " abdu-rahu saleh al-tam , the chief kidnapper told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" those are baseless reports . " he spoke via a mobile phone from a hideout in naba 'ah , a mountainous area east of the capital , sana 'a , where he and four other tribesmen had been holding the german mother , father and daughter since december 15 . " our demands are specified from the beginning , and no other demands are added , " he said . the armed men , from the bani dhabian tribe in the west of the arab peninsula nation , had originally demanded the release of two relatives jailed in the yemeni capital , sana 'a , over a previous kidnapping of five local engineers last year . the chief tribesman had also insisted authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tribesman have called for the release by the us of sheikh mohammed ali al-moayad the two detained yemenis , who the kidnappers reportedly wanted released , hail from the same tribe as the kidnappers and were charged with giving financial support to al-qaeda and the palestinian group hamas . they were arrested in germany in 2003 and extradited to the united states where they were both initially dealt hefty prison terms .

mary evans , who is leaving johnstown primary school , in carmarthenshire , has seen school dinners change over three decades .

she added : " to cook for children you have to be clever - if you mash fruit and vegetables up enough they do n't even realise they are there .

a school cook who has served up meals to children for 30 years says she is retiring knowing her pupils are eating healthier dinners .
mary evans , who is leaving johnstown primary school , in carmarthenshire , has seen school dinners change over three decades .
she said the young pupils today are eating less sugar and salt .
and she said technological improvements now made the job easier than when she started in the 1970s .
looking back over her time at the school , she remembered serving up liver and onions when she first started in the kitchen .
but these days , following the healthy eating revolution in schools led by tv chef jamie oliver , children are more likely to be given pasta bake and chicken tikka .
despite all the changes , however , she said the traditional roast dinner is still the most popular dish served to pupils today .
to cook for children you have to be clever - if you mash fruit and vegetables up enough they do n't even realise they are there mary evans " the roast dinner has always been the favourite , but the way we make it has changed - i remember the meat being delivered in slabs that we 'd have to chop up by hand , now everything is far easier with all the new technology , " she said .
" the food is far healthier these days too with less salt and sugar and more fruit and veg . "
she added : " to cook for children you have to be clever - if you mash fruit and vegetables up enough they do n't even realise they are there .
i chop onions up really small and put them in my beefburgers - because they do n't know they are there they do n't question it ! "
ms evans said her retirement on friday comes with mixed reactions .
while she has many plans with which to fill her spare time , she said she would miss the children and colleagues she has worked with over the years .
" i am going to miss the children so much , and i 've been so lucky to have worked with some lovely girls over the years , " she said .
" but it is hard work - i 'm up at 5am every morning to get to work by 6.15 .
" it 'll be nice to have a bit of time to myself , although i must say that i 've enjoyed every minute . "
' fond memories ' sandra weigel , catering services manager , said ms evans would be missed , not least by the pupils .
" the likes of mary are few and far between - she has always been very hard working with an exceptional high standard of cooking , " she said .
" mary has always worked over and above what was expected of her . "
councillor pat jones , carmarthenshire council 's executive board member for health and social care , said : " mary is quite obviously an inspiration to all who have worked with her and known her over the years .
" i 'm sure there are hundreds of people who will have fond memories of having been served dinners by her . "

the audit commission 's report into the effect of the credit crunch on councils showed an increasing demand for their services as well as a drop in income .
but the report says most councils are well placed to weather the downturn .
the commission questioned the chief financial officers of 122 councils in england between october and november .
the public services watchdog 's study of council finances found that prices had risen faster than assumed when the government set the level of council grant for 2008/2009 , with 77 % of authorities receiving a cut in funding in real terms .
less income the largest concern reported by councils was the reduced income from planning fees due to the housing slump , with almost half recording substantial falls .
the survey found 52 % of authorities had suffered a fall in income from car parking fees of 3 % or more , as more people leave their car at home .
one had seen a fall of 5 % , with a fall in income of £ 200,000 .
the research - crunch time ? - also showed councils had been hit hard by increases in fuel bills , with the cost of lighting the streets up 40 % in a year .
the report found the higher demand for state school places for children was a particular problem in london , and a fifth of all those councils questioned expected that trend to accelerate as the downturn deepened .
there was also growing concern " that the downturn will lead to more family breakdowns , with more children being taken into care . "
the commission 's findings also include : two thirds of councils are reporting increases in applications for housing and other benefits as a direct result of the downturn a third are already dealing with increases in homelessness a quarter of england 's councils have seen increased demand for elderly care one in seven has made compulsory redundancies , or plans to do so many councils are reviewing recruitment , or seeking savings by leaving posts unfilled .
alongside efficiency drives , a third of councils have dipped into their reserves , while about a third have signalled or imposed increases in fees and charges , and 16 % were cutting services .
realistic report however , the study concludes most local authorities anticipated the increased costs , and loss of income to some extent .
it also says they have adequate reserves to cushion the estimated £ 2.5 billion impact . "
councils are now well-placed to fully support their communities - i expect them to make the most of their wide range of powers to do so " local government minister john healey the report also considered that recent falls in inflation , fuel prices and interest rates were helping ease the pressure on councils .
steve bundred , chief executive of the audit commission , said the report " injected a little realism " after all the " doom-laden headlines " .
" while councils are in the firing line and undoubtedly face some very tough choices in the longer term , they should keep a sense of perspective , " he said .
" by and large councils knew this downturn was coming and have planned for it .
the pressures are real but councils are coping with them well . "
local government minister john healey said the government 's three-year settlement for councils would give them the flexibility to manage their budgets through the downturn .
" councils are now well-placed to fully support their communities - i expect them to make the most of their wide range of powers to do so . "
' there to help ' chris lawrence-pietroni of the local government association also emphasised that the role of councils is to help people through the downturn .
he noted that some councils were providing interest-free loans for those struggling with mortgage costs and that authorities could be flexible with business rates .
he told the bbc : " the impact of the recession will be different in different parts of the country so we need local solutions which councils are well-placed to provide .
" councils are there on people 's side , on the side of businesses , to help them get through this . "

the audit commission 's report into the effect of the credit crunch on councils showed an increasing demand for their services as well as a drop in income .
but the report says most councils are well placed to weather the downturn .
the commission questioned the chief financial officers of 122 councils in england between october and november .
the public services watchdog 's study of council finances found that prices had risen faster than assumed when the government set the level of council grant for 2008/2009 , with 77 % of authorities receiving a cut in funding in real terms .
less income the largest concern reported by councils was the reduced income from planning fees due to the housing slump , with almost half recording substantial falls .
the survey found 52 % of authorities had suffered a fall in income from car parking fees of 3 % or more , as more people leave their car at home .
one had seen a fall of 5 % , with a fall in income of £ 200,000 .
the research - crunch time ? - also showed councils had been hit hard by increases in fuel bills , with the cost of lighting the streets up 40 % in a year .
the report found the higher demand for state school places for children was a particular problem in london , and a fifth of all those councils questioned expected that trend to accelerate as the downturn deepened .
there was also growing concern " that the downturn will lead to more family breakdowns , with more children being taken into care . "
the commission 's findings also include : two thirds of councils are reporting increases in applications for housing and other benefits as a direct result of the downturn a third are already dealing with increases in homelessness a quarter of england 's councils have seen increased demand for elderly care one in seven has made compulsory redundancies , or plans to do so many councils are reviewing recruitment , or seeking savings by leaving posts unfilled .
alongside efficiency drives , a third of councils have dipped into their reserves , while about a third have signalled or imposed increases in fees and charges , and 16 % were cutting services .
realistic report however , the study concludes most local authorities anticipated the increased costs , and loss of income to some extent .
it also says they have adequate reserves to cushion the estimated £ 2.5 billion impact .
councils are now well-placed to fully support their communities - i expect them to make the most of their wide range of powers to do so local government minister john healey the report also considered that recent falls in inflation , fuel prices and interest rates were helping ease the pressure on councils .
steve bundred , chief executive of the audit commission , said the report " injected a little realism " after all the " doom-laden headlines " .
" while councils are in the firing line and undoubtedly face some very tough choices in the longer term , they should keep a sense of perspective , " he said .
" by and large councils knew this downturn was coming and have planned for it .
the pressures are real but councils are coping with them well . "
local government minister john healey said the government 's three-year settlement for councils would give them the flexibility to manage their budgets through the downturn .
" councils are now well-placed to fully support their communities - i expect them to make the most of their wide range of powers to do so . "
' there to help ' chris lawrence-pietroni of the local government association also emphasised that the role of councils is to help people through the downturn .
he noted that some councils were providing interest-free loans for those struggling with mortgage costs and that authorities could be flexible with business rates .
he told the bbc : " the impact of the recession will be different in different parts of the country so we need local solutions which councils are well-placed to provide .
" councils are there on people 's side , on the side of businesses , to help them get through this . "

this famous phrase has inspired generations of investigative reporters , but its author managed to evade detection for 30 years .
mark felt was at the centre of one of the longest-running mysteries in journalism it was one of america 's greatest mysteries : who was the anonymous source who had leaked information about the watergate scandal that led to the resignation of us president richard nixon in 1974 ?
mark felt , a former deputy head of the fbi , revealed in 2005 that it was he who made the suggestion that led to the discovery of the link between the burglary at the democratic national committee hq in washington 's watergate complex in june 1972 , and the financing of nixon 's re-election campaign .
for decades , the informant was known only as deep throat .
he was the shadowy , chain-smoking character played by hal holbrook in the hit movie all the president 's men , starring robert redford and dustin hoffman .
conflict mr felt , who was responsible for investigating the burglary , had figured prominently in the 30-year guessing game about deep throat 's identity .
he repeatedly denied that he was the source who met washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein in underground car parks to provide clues to the scandal .
carl bernstein and bob woodward said mr felt took a " monumental risk " but in 2005 , in an article written by his friend and lawyer john o 'connor for the us magazine vanity fair , he admitted : " i 'm the guy they used to call deep throat . "
according to reports , he had lived for decades in the belief that he betrayed his fbi badge by disclosing government secrets .
" mark felt that he was somehow a dishonourable guy , an fbi agent who was disloyal , who leaked when he should n't have leaked .
he kept saying an fbi agent does n't do this , " mr o 'connor told us media in 2005 .
mr felt 's family only learned of his secret three years earlier and , according to mr o 'connor , they helped convince him that he " was a hero " .
" after talking to him for two to three years , probably for the last six to nine months , he was really convinced he was a hero .
he knows he did the right thing .
he knows he had to breach his code of ethics to save the country . "
mr felt 's son , mark junior , told vanity fair : " he would not have done it if he did n't feel it was the only way to get around the corruption in the white house and justice department .
he was tortured inside , but never would show it . "
while many praised mr felt 's role as an informant , some turned on the former fbi man .
the former nixon speechwriter and presidential hopeful , pat buchanan , described mr felt a traitor .
' dashing ' mark felt spent his latter years living in santa rosa , california .
he died at the age of 95 at a hospice close to his home .
the former fbi official , described by mr woodward as a dashing , grey-haired figure , has a few possible motives for doing what he did .
one was personal - anger at being passed over for director after the death of j edgar hoover .
the other was concern that the white house was sabotaging the fbi 's watergate investigation .
nixon was forced to resign in 1974 in his memoir , the fbi pyramid , mr felt wrote that patrick gray , who succeeded hoover , was " sharing all the bureau 's knowledge with the white house staff " .
he wrote that he " felt they had neutralised the fbi " .
" for me , as well as for all the agents who were involved , it had become a question of our integrity , " mr felt wrote .
" we were under attack for dragging our feet , and as professional law enforcement officers , we were determined to go on . "
mr gray was never confirmed as fbi director , and in 1973 william d ruckelshaus took over the bureau .
mr felt left the bureau later that year .
he had had a long career with the fbi and , according to reports , was seen as a model official .
quoted in the washington post , harry brandon , who retired from the fbi as deputy assistant for counterintelligence and counterterrorism , described him as : " straight .
very honest .
very straight . "
mr felt was born in idaho in 1913 .
he attended the university of idaho and george washington university law school , before joining the fbi in january 1942 .
during world war ii he worked in the agency 's espionage section .
according to the washington post , it was here that he learned counter-intelligence tricks that became part of his relationship with their reporters : a flowerpot on mr woodward 's balcony would indicate that the reporter required a meeting , while a clock face inked on the reporter 's daily new york times would reveal the time mr felt would be waiting in the car park .
mr felt steadily rose through the fbi 's ranks and by the early 1970s was one of the bureau 's top officials .
pardoned in 1978 , he was involved in one of the most prominent cases of high-ranking fbi officials being the target of criminal charges .
he was indicted with another official , edward miller , on charges of authorising illegal break-ins during the nixon administration on friends of members of the radical anti-vietnam war movement , the weather underground .
they were convicted in 1980 but pardoned a few months later by president ronald reagan .
the president said they had " acted on high principle to bring an end to the terrorism that was threatening our nation " .

" for me , as well as for all the agents who were involved , it had become a question of our integrity , " mr felt wrote .
" we were under attack for dragging our feet , and as professional law enforcement officers , we were determined to go on . "
mr gray was never confirmed as fbi director , and in 1973 william d ruckelshaus took over the bureau .
mr felt left the bureau later that year .
he had had a long career with the fbi and , according to reports , was seen as a model official .
quoted in the washington post , harry brandon , who retired from the fbi as deputy assistant for counterintelligence and counterterrorism , described him as : " straight .
very honest .
very straight . "
mr felt was born in idaho in 1913 .
he attended the university of idaho and george washington university law school , before joining the fbi in january 1942 .
during world war ii he worked in the agency 's espionage section .
according to the washington post , it was here that he learned counter-intelligence tricks that became part of his relationship with their reporters : a flowerpot on mr woodward 's balcony would indicate that the reporter required a meeting , while a clock face inked on the reporter 's daily new york times would reveal the time mr felt would be waiting in the car park .
mr felt steadily rose through the fbi 's ranks and by the early 1970s was one of the bureau 's top officials .
pardoned in 1978 , he was involved in one of the most prominent cases of high-ranking fbi officials being the target of criminal charges .
he was indicted with another official , edward miller , on charges of authorising illegal break-ins during the nixon administration on friends of members of the radical anti-vietnam war movement , the weather underground .
they were convicted in 1980 but pardoned a few months later by president ronald reagan .
the president said they had " acted on high principle to bring an end to the terrorism that was threatening our nation " .

dr humayra abedin , 33 , from east london , returned to the uk on tuesday as a result of a british court order made under the new forced marriage act .
she was held captive by her parents for four months and in november made to marry a man without her consent .
dr abedin is to go to the high court on friday to get the marriage dissolved .
the high court in london issued the order while she was still in bangladesh under new legislation which allows british courts to prevent someone from being forced into marriage .
dr abedin 's british lawyer , anne-marie hutchinson , said proceedings under the act will be heard at the high court before mr justice coleridge on friday morning .
under duress in a statement issued by ms hutchinson after her return to london , dr abedin said : " on 14 november 2008 , i was forced to marry a person of my parents ' choice .
" i was removed to another province of bangladesh .
i entered into the marriage ceremony under duress .
i did not consent to the marriage . "
dr abedin came to the uk six years ago to study for a masters degree in public health at leeds university .
she had hoped to become a registrar at a gp surgery in east london in august but , after receiving news her mother had taken ill , returned to the capital of bangladesh , dhaka , where she was then allegedly held captive .

dr humayra abedin , 33 , from east london , returned to the uk on tuesday as a result of a british court order made under the new forced marriage act .
she was held captive by her parents for four months and in november made to marry a man without her consent .
dr abedin is to go to the high court on friday to get the marriage dissolved .
the high court in london issued the order while she was still in bangladesh under new legislation which allows british courts to prevent someone from being forced into marriage .
dr abedin 's british lawyer , anne-marie hutchinson , said proceedings under the act will be heard at the high court before mr justice coleridge on friday morning .
under duress in a statement issued by ms hutchinson after her return to london , dr abedin said : " on 14 november 2008 , i was forced to marry a person of my parents ' choice .
" i was removed to another province of bangladesh .
i entered into the marriage ceremony under duress .
i did not consent to the marriage . "
dr abedin came to the uk six years ago to study for a masters degree in public health at leeds university .
she had hoped to become a registrar at a gp surgery in east london in august but , after receiving news her mother had taken ill , returned to the capital of bangladesh , dhaka , where she was then allegedly held captive .
while in captivity , dr abedin raised the alarm by sending an email to a friend asking for help .

dr humayra abedin , 33 , from east london , returned to the uk on tuesday as a result of a british court order made under the new forced marriage act .
she was held captive by her parents for four months and in november made to marry a man without her consent .
dr abedin is to go to the high court on friday to get the marriage dissolved .
the high court in london issued the order while she was still in bangladesh under new legislation which allows british courts to prevent someone from being forced into marriage .
dr abedin 's british lawyer , anne-marie hutchinson , said proceedings under the act will be heard at the high court before mr justice coleridge on friday morning .
under duress in a statement issued by ms hutchinson after her return to london , dr abedin said : " on 14 november 2008 , i was forced to marry a person of my parents ' choice .
" i was removed to another province of bangladesh .
i entered into the marriage ceremony under duress .
i did not consent to the marriage . "
dr abedin came to the uk six years ago to study for a masters degree in public health at leeds university .
she had hoped to become a registrar at a gp surgery in east london in august but , after receiving news her mother had taken ill , returned to the capital of bangladesh , dhaka , where she was then allegedly held captive .
while in captivity , dr abedin raised the alarm by sending an email to a friend asking for help .

but the country 's economic crisis has brought a new breed of unlikely protesters to the fore .
they were gathered in force on a cold monday night at the reykjavik university cinema .
its sweeping auditorium was packed with very angry people of all ages .
on the stage at the front , stony-faced political leaders faced a hail of invective , as the audience poured forth their stories of losing their savings or defaulting on their mortgages .
it was like a 21st century version of the stocks , but also a form of group therapy , a form of catharsis .
the crowd cheered when one speaker said he had refused to repay his loans .
then asta rut jonasdottir took the rostrum and won more cheers by telling the crowd she was thinking of emigrating .
" i 'm a project manager with a pharmaceuticals company , but i spoke here tonight as just a housewife , " she said , apparently a bit overwhelmed by the reception she received .
" i 'm thinking of leaving the country because the government is n't doing anything .
but it 's difficult : i have a nine-year-old son .
maybe at the end of the school year i 'll make my decision . "
" there 's a lot of anger and stuff , but the politicians need to listen to the people " gunnar sigurdsson asta is one of iceland 's many unlikely protesters : people who were never politically active but who now find themselves moved to act in the wake of this country 's worst economic crisis in generations .
" i hope what we did tonight , and what the icelandic people have been doing over the last few weeks , will make the government listen to the people , " she said .
' needed answers ' others are less diplomatic .
many people are just calling for the government to resign .
" there 's a lot of anger and stuff , but the politicians need to listen to the people , " said gunnar sigurdsson , the organiser of these events , which are now weekly .
mr sigurdsson , the director of a small reykjavik theatre , has been propelled from relative obscurity to political stardom in a matter of weeks .
" i started this with my daughters .
i paid for the hall and everything .
i saw the politicians on tv and i thought : i need to hear some answers .
so i e-mailed all the members of parliament .
thirteen of them came to the first meeting . "
as the meetings gathered momentum , the media showed interest and mr sigurdsson took advantage , making a live on-air challenge to the government to appear at the next meeting .
" i said i 'd put their names next to the chairs , so everyone would see who did n't come .
we had eight out of 12 cabinet ministers . "
even prime minister geir haarde turned up .
another of iceland 's unlikely protesters is einar mar gudmundsson .
one of the country 's most famous authors , he has spoken at street demonstrations and written countless pieces in the newspapers .
" the politicians of iceland were fast asleep , shrugged their shoulders and clinked glasses with the financial grandees , " he wrote in one recent article .
" they even felt insulted if they were not invited to the feast , which was enveloped in hollywood glamour and razzmatazz . "
losing steam ms jonasdottir , mr sigurdsson and mr gudmundsson are all trying in different ways to generate debate in iceland - a highly cultured society which regularly tops international leagues for literacy and education levels .
but there have also been more direct confrontations .
this week , protesters occupied the cabinet office and the headquarters of landsbanki , iceland 's second largest bank , now under state control .
the protests followed a nervous sit-in , opposite police in riot gear , inside the central bank headquarters a couple of weeks ago and an occupation of the parliament building last week .
these are highly unusual events in iceland , normally a very reserved society .
but not everyone is convinced the protests are going anywhere .
sturla jonsson became the ad hoc spokesperson for a group of truck drivers who led protests against petrol prices back in april .
since then , his own building and trucking business has gone bankrupt and he faces losing his home .
he has watched as the protests have grown in size , only for numbers to tail off as christmas draws near .
he thinks they are running out of steam .
" i do n't know what it is with icelandic people : why they do n't stand up and protest like they do in britain and france , " he says , adding with a smile : " i think we really have to have a revolution here ! "
that is clearly not on the cards .
but nor , despite the best efforts of the protesters , are there any signs of any leading politician resigning .

on the stage at the front , stony-faced political leaders faced a hail of invective , as the audience poured forth their stories of losing their savings or defaulting on their mortgages .
it was like a 21st century version of the stocks , but also a form of group therapy , a form of catharsis .

no line on the horizon is the group 's 12th studio album and their first since 2004 's how to dismantle an atomic bomb .
it was originally expected to be released by the end of 2008 , but the band announced in september they would continue to write more songs .
the album will be released in the uk on 2 march , with its debut in north america coming a day later .
' versions and incarnations ' the band began work on the album a couple of years ago with us producer rick rubin , who is best known for working with run dmc , johnny cash , beastie boys , and red hot chili peppers .
however , these initial sessions were eventually shelved .
" we actually laid all that stuff to one side , " guitarist the edge told mojo magazine last month .
" none of the rick material went into this project .
everything has been written subsequently . "
however , the star added the band will " get back to the material we started with rick at some point " .
long-time collaborators brian eno and danny lanois were drafted in , recording in morocco , new york , london and the band 's own studio in dublin .
when asked what the album sounds like the edge said : " it 's a record of two halves .
one half is songs that came virtually fully-formed out of sessions we did with brian and danny .
" then the other half is material we 've kicked around a while and went through the usual cycle of versions and incarnations .
" it sounds like a u2 album but it does n't sound like anything we 've done before and it does n't really sound like anything that 's happening at the moment . "
the group 's last record sold more than nine million copies worldwide , and picked up eight grammy awards , including album of the year and best rock song for lead single vertigo .

' versions and incarnations ' the band began work on the album a couple of years ago with us producer rick rubin , who is best known for working with run dmc , johnny cash , beastie boys , and red hot chili peppers .
however , these initial sessions were eventually shelved .
" we actually laid all that stuff to one side , " guitarist the edge told mojo magazine last month .
" none of the rick material went into this project .
everything has been written subsequently . "
however , the star added the band will " get back to the material we started with rick at some point " .
long-time collaborators brian eno and danny lanois were drafted in , recording in morocco , new york , london and the band 's own studio in dublin .
when asked what the album sounds like the edge said : " it 's a record of two halves .
one half is songs that came virtually fully-formed out of sessions we did with brian and danny .
" then the other half is material we 've kicked around a while and went through the usual cycle of versions and incarnations .
" it sounds like a u2 album but it does n't sound like anything we 've done before and it does n't really sound like anything that 's happening at the moment . "
the group 's last record sold more than nine million copies worldwide , and picked up eight grammy awards , including album of the year and best rock song for lead single vertigo .

simon crowcoft wants reassurances that correct procedures were followed when graham power was suspended last month .
his suspension came after it emerged information previously released over a child abuse inquiry was inaccurate .
a new investigating team looking into claims of abuse at former children 's home haut de la garenne , revealed no-one had been murdered there .
mr crowcoft wants a qualified body to do what is called a compliance check over the suspension of mr power .
employment relations he argues any employee of the states should expect complaints against them to be dealt with correctly .
and he says a review should reassure all staff working for the government that the states will not disregard the principles of good employment relations .
the constable says a states debate on the subject would have to be in private in accordance with the law .
former home affairs minister deputy andrew lewis , who suspended the police chief , says the procedure was followed to the letter .
mr power has denied any wrongdoing .
