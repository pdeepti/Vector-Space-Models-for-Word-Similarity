ote wants the court to order siemens to reveal details of an internal inquiry into its activities in greece , with a view to eventually suing for damages .
greek prosecutors are investigating the 1997 contract which siemens is suspected of securing by paying 75 million dollars to ote executives .
sueddeutsche said ote would seek compensation over a letter of intent dating from 1997 which led to ote buying equipment worth 1 billion euros from siemens to improve greek phone systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation has taken a battering in another report , german news weekly der spiegel said a law firm hired by siemens to sue 11 former executives for failing to uncover and halt the scandal had already conducted a detailed inquiry .
the lawyers maintained that internal checks to prevent corruption had been " objectively faulty " as early as 2001 , spiegel said .
the affair has rocked the two main political parties in greece , the ruling new democracy conservatives and the opposition pasok socialists .
the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 02.08.2008 communist-era spy files made public in the czech republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many documents were destroyed or altered nearly two decades after the fall of communism in the czech republic , the government has opened an archive on the country 's secret police .
historians have criticized the decision . the czechoslovak state security -lrb- stb -rrb- files contain the names of 10,000 people that were of interest to the feared secret police .
the files , along with the names they contain , were recently made available on the internet by the prague archive of czech security agencies .
the czech republic is the only eastern european country to systematically make public information about the former secret police .
there is no english-language version of the web site or the files .
the list is only the start .
approximately 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of files pertaining to the country 's secret police have been made public .
the files contain both the names of spies as well as those of their victims .
whether to make the stb files public has been a sensitive issue in the czech republic for years .
files have long proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel opposed making the documents public since communism ended 19 years ago and the stb was shut down , there have been various efforts to shed light on this dark part of czechoslovakia 's history .
in 1990 , president vaclav havel enacted a law that prohibited former party big shots and spies from becoming civil servants .
but havel refrained from making secret police files public , as he worried that doing so would pose a risk to peace in the young democracy .
in 1992 , a former regime critic illegally published a list of former " unofficial employees " of the secret police .
besides causing a media and political storm , the scandal launched a long-running debate about whether to open up the files .
since 1996 , citizens have been allowed to see files that pertain directly to them , but the largest portion of the files remained closed .
in 2002 the parliament decided to make all documents public .
some files were altered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are skeptical that the files will prove useful but the push did n't really begin until last year under the conservative government of mirek topolanek .
it was then that the administration of the files was transferred from the interior ministry to the institute for the study of totalitarian regimes .
the institute is in turn affiliated with the state security archive .
since last year , the public has had access to nearly all of the files .
christiane brenner of collegium carolinum , a munich research center focused on bohemia , told dw-world.de that she finds the decision to be extremely problematic .
as the communist regime was falling and in the time immediately thereafter , former secret police altered and destroyed documents , brenner said .
“ that means that it 's impossible to know even today how complete this document collection is and you also do n't know about the truthfulness of its content , ” the historian said .
a treasure trove ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's decision has been controversial ivo bock of the research center for eastern european studies at the university of bremen is also skeptical .
historians are against the decision not because they oppose making the documents public per se , but because they question the significance of the documents .
“ they believe that one should not consider them the authoritative or authentic interpretation of the communist era , ” he said .
he said he thinks there is little public interest in the files nearly two decades after the end of communism .
yet the czech republic has gone about exploring its communist past more intensively than many of its neighbors . andreas leixnering -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it is making images for historians of the files on 800,000 people who were dubbed the " non-repatriables " after millions of other people displaced by the nazis had joyfully returned to their old homes during 1945 and 1946 .
fewer than a third of those staying put in the west as refugees were jews .
more were people from poland , the baltic states and yugoslavia whose homelands had fallen under communist control and who feared instant death if they went home .
so they waited in dreary refugee camps all over germany , austria , italy and england for permission to emigrate .
one of the displaced-persons camps was in cinecitta , the film studios in the italian capital rome .
it took until 1952 to find most of them new homes in israel , the united states , australia or south america .
a treasure trove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its collections will be of great value to historians historians will now gain the opportunity to read a treasure trove of so-called care-and-maintenance questionnaires in which refugees describe their wartime experiences and give reasons why they wish to emigrate .
researchers may also discover a few nazi collaborators hidden among the victims , concealing war crimes from allied investigators .
john demjanjuk , 88 , currently awaiting deportation from the united states , was in displaced persons camps till he gained entry to the united states in 1952 .
he is alleged to have been a murderous ss guard at the nazis ' treblinka death camp in ukraine .
kathrin flor , a spokeswoman for the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- archives at bad arolsen , emphasized that the vast majority of the non-repatriables were innocent victims , swept up by the nazis into concentration camps , forced labor or prisoner-of-war stalags .
" many from eastern europe said , ' i will never go back , ' because they knew what stalinism meant for them .
catholic priests for example knew they could not go back to work in the baltic states , " she said .
for families and researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its was only recently opened to researchers and general public most of the documents were produced between 1947 and 1952 and are in 350,000 envelopes , usually one per family .
filed with the questionnaires are photographs , medical files , birth and marriage certificates and letters .
" the documents are of great interest for both the families of these people and for researchers , as they reveal the post-war migration movements and immigration policies of the time , " said alexander lommel , the its head of digitization .
flor said the analysis is only just starting .
the its only used the documents to trace missing people and reunite families .
the its began the scanning work in july and expects to produce 15 million images of the non-repatriables ' records by the end of next year as well as emigration lists totaling around 700,000 images .
the data will be sent to holocaust museums in washington and jerusalem .
most importantly , the images can be easily copied and saved in perpetuity , even if the yellowing paper crumbles away .
a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digitalizing the archive materials will help preserve them for posterity the its had to specially develop 15 computer work stations for the latest project because the paper sizes varied so much , from passport photos to forms on us tabloid-size sheets 432- millimeters-long .
the project follows digitalization of the stock of documents on incarceration into about 18 million images , the its name index of 42 million images and a 7-million-image index of the initial displaced persons .
another 8-million-image collection , on people press-ganged by the nazis into forced labor , is scheduled for completion this month -lrb- august 2008 -rrb- .
the newest project needs a three-person team at each work-station with one taking the fragile documents out and putting them in a device to flatten the paper , another operating the camera and lights and a third in charge of " post-processing " including numbering .
roughly 70 percent of the documents stored at the its have been scanned so far .
bad arolsen holds 50 million references to 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime on 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- of shelving .
no end in sight ?
digitalization of the entire archive is expected to be completed in 2011 .
" we 've already digitized 3.5 terabytes of data and feel there 's still no end in sight , " said michael hoffmann , head of computing .
releasing the data from six decades of secrecy took a long campaign led by us holocaust researchers , who argued that families and historians had to see the data before the last eyewitnesses died .
finally , last year , the 11 states making up the its commission agreed to relax the secrecy and directed the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- , which manages the its on their behalf , to begin making mirror copies of the bad arolsen data . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief solana , left , with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili at the geneva meeting in july , the six western powers put forward an enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives .
it includes far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities .
britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures .
" real commitment to diplomatic solution " the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
" even the americans have visibly got involved and sent a negotiator for the first time , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
" it is all meant to demonstrate there really is a commitment to a diplomatic solution . "
steinmeier said he expected a clear signal in favor of a mutual suspension .
" we would then suspend our efforts for sanctions and iran would suspend the expansion of its centrifuges .
it 's a clear offer that deserves a clear answer , and a prompt one . "
the minister said it would be " negligent " not to use the opportunity .
in brussels , meanwhile , eu diplomats said saturday that the eu was still awaiting tehran 's official response to an offer of new talks to resolve the dispute over iran 's nuclear activities , and that an answer may be coming on monday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 02.08.2008 berlin 's spree river floats towards a clean future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners might someday be able to swim in , not just on top of , the spree a giant pontoon will be installed in berlin 's spree river .
the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief solana , left , with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili at the geneva meeting in july , the six western powers put forward an enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives .
it includes far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities .
britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures .
" real commitment to diplomatic solution " the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
" even the americans have visibly got involved and sent a negotiator for the first time , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
" it is all meant to demonstrate there really is a commitment to a diplomatic solution . "
steinmeier said he expected a clear signal in favor of a mutual suspension .
" we would then suspend our efforts for sanctions and iran would suspend the expansion of its centrifuges .
it 's a clear offer that deserves a clear answer , and a prompt one . "
the minister said it would be " negligent " not to use the opportunity .

the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .

a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .

" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
the floating pontoons could be used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . dw staff -lrb- th / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .

" real commitment to diplomatic solution " the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
" even the americans have visibly got involved and sent a negotiator for the first time , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
" it is all meant to demonstrate there really is a commitment to a diplomatic solution . "
steinmeier said he expected a clear signal in favor of a mutual suspension .
" we would then suspend our efforts for sanctions and iran would suspend the expansion of its centrifuges .
it 's a clear offer that deserves a clear answer , and a prompt one . "
the minister said it would be " negligent " not to use the opportunity .

ote wants the court to order siemens to reveal details of an internal inquiry into its activities in greece , with a view to eventually suing for damages .
greek prosecutors are investigating the 1997 contract which siemens is suspected of securing by paying 75 million dollars to ote executives .
sueddeutsche said ote would seek compensation over a letter of intent dating from 1997 which led to ote buying equipment worth 1 billion euros from siemens to improve greek phone systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation has taken a battering in another report , german news weekly der spiegel said a law firm hired by siemens to sue 11 former executives for failing to uncover and halt the scandal had already conducted a detailed inquiry .
the lawyers maintained that internal checks to prevent corruption had been " objectively faulty " as early as 2001 , spiegel said .
the affair has rocked the two main political parties in greece , the ruling new democracy conservatives and the opposition pasok socialists .
the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 02.08.2008 berlin 's spree river floats towards a clean future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners might someday be able to swim in , not just on top of , the spree a giant pontoon will be installed in berlin 's spree river .
the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
the floating pontoons could be used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . dw staff -lrb- th / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 02.08.2008 archives to yield names of stranded post-wwii refugees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its holds 50 million references to 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime vast and secret archives recording victims of the nazis have begun yielding up names of the post-second-world-war refugees who could not or would not go home . the record site , run by the red cross at bad arolsen in germany , has already digitized its unparalleled document collection on holocaust victims and survivors and slave labourers .
now it is making images for historians of the files on 800,000 people who were dubbed the " non-repatriables " after millions of other people displaced by the nazis had joyfully returned to their old homes during 1945 and 1946 .
fewer than a third of those staying put in the west as refugees were jews .
more were people from poland , the baltic states and yugoslavia whose homelands had fallen under communist control and who feared instant death if they went home .
so they waited in dreary refugee camps all over germany , austria , italy and england for permission to emigrate .
one of the displaced-persons camps was in cinecitta , the film studios in the italian capital rome .
it took until 1952 to find most of them new homes in israel , the united states , australia or south america .
a treasure trove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its collections will be of great value to historians historians will now gain the opportunity to read a treasure trove of so-called care-and-maintenance questionnaires in which refugees describe their wartime experiences and give reasons why they wish to emigrate .
researchers may also discover a few nazi collaborators hidden among the victims , concealing war crimes from allied investigators .
john demjanjuk , 88 , currently awaiting deportation from the united states , was in displaced persons camps till he gained entry to the united states in 1952 .
he is alleged to have been a murderous ss guard at the nazis ' treblinka death camp in ukraine .
kathrin flor , a spokeswoman for the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- archives at bad arolsen , emphasized that the vast majority of the non-repatriables were innocent victims , swept up by the nazis into concentration camps , forced labor or prisoner-of-war stalags .
" many from eastern europe said , ' i will never go back , ' because they knew what stalinism meant for them .
catholic priests for example knew they could not go back to work in the baltic states , " she said .
for families and researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its was only recently opened to researchers and general public most of the documents were produced between 1947 and 1952 and are in 350,000 envelopes , usually one per family .
filed with the questionnaires are photographs , medical files , birth and marriage certificates and letters .
" the documents are of great interest for both the families of these people and for researchers , as they reveal the post-war migration movements and immigration policies of the time , " said alexander lommel , the its head of digitization .
flor said the analysis is only just starting .
the its only used the documents to trace missing people and reunite families .
the its began the scanning work in july and expects to produce 15 million images of the non-repatriables ' records by the end of next year as well as emigration lists totaling around 700,000 images .
the data will be sent to holocaust museums in washington and jerusalem .
most importantly , the images can be easily copied and saved in perpetuity , even if the yellowing paper crumbles away .
a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digitalizing the archive materials will help preserve them for posterity the its had to specially develop 15 computer work stations for the latest project because the paper sizes varied so much , from passport photos to forms on us tabloid-size sheets 432- millimeters-long .
the project follows digitalization of the stock of documents on incarceration into about 18 million images , the its name index of 42 million images and a 7-million-image index of the initial displaced persons .
another 8-million-image collection , on people press-ganged by the nazis into forced labor , is scheduled for completion this month -lrb- august 2008 -rrb- .
the newest project needs a three-person team at each work-station with one taking the fragile documents out and putting them in a device to flatten the paper , another operating the camera and lights and a third in charge of " post-processing " including numbering .
roughly 70 percent of the documents stored at the its have been scanned so far .
bad arolsen holds 50 million references to 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime on 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- of shelving .
no end in sight ?
digitalization of the entire archive is expected to be completed in 2011 .
" we 've already digitized 3.5 terabytes of data and feel there 's still no end in sight , " said michael hoffmann , head of computing .
releasing the data from six decades of secrecy took a long campaign led by us holocaust researchers , who argued that families and historians had to see the data before the last eyewitnesses died .
finally , last year , the 11 states making up the its commission agreed to relax the secrecy and directed the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- , which manages the its on their behalf , to begin making mirror copies of the bad arolsen data . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is becoming increasingly clear that structural factors like the growth in global food demand can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels over the medium-term , though substantially below the most recent price hikes , " the report from the european commission 's agriculture department said on friday , aug .
1 .
" reasons for current price pressures are unambiguous ... a combination of steadily increasing demand and lagging supply or production shortfall , exacerbated by short-term economic and policy factors , " the report said .
since the beginning of the year , alarm bells have sounded around the world at the surge in prices for basic foods .
staggering numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices are likely to remain relatively high , says the eu according to figures from the commission , the eu 's executive , in february wheat in the united states was 113 percent more costly than in february 2007 .
european wheat was 93 percent dearer , thai rice 52 percent more expensive and dairy products 30 percent more costly .
the figures sparked crisis talks in europe , with eu leaders debating the issue at a summit in brussels in june .
but friday 's study stresses that there is no single reason for the price rises , with long-term factors such as growing world food consumption , short-term ones such as weather and crop conditions , and external ones such as fuel prices and financial uncertainty all playing a part .
the responses the report suggests are equally varied .
they include boosting food aid to the poor , opening unused land for farming and increasing research into crop protection and yield improvements . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it is making images for historians of the files on 800,000 people who were dubbed the " non-repatriables " after millions of other people displaced by the nazis had joyfully returned to their old homes during 1945 and 1946 .
fewer than a third of those staying put in the west as refugees were jews .
more were people from poland , the baltic states and yugoslavia whose homelands had fallen under communist control and who feared instant death if they went home .
so they waited in dreary refugee camps all over germany , austria , italy and england for permission to emigrate .
one of the displaced-persons camps was in cinecitta , the film studios in the italian capital rome .
it took until 1952 to find most of them new homes in israel , the united states , australia or south america .
a treasure trove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its collections will be of great value to historians historians will now gain the opportunity to read a treasure trove of so-called care-and-maintenance questionnaires in which refugees describe their wartime experiences and give reasons why they wish to emigrate .
researchers may also discover a few nazi collaborators hidden among the victims , concealing war crimes from allied investigators .
john demjanjuk , 88 , currently awaiting deportation from the united states , was in displaced persons camps till he gained entry to the united states in 1952 .
he is alleged to have been a murderous ss guard at the nazis ' treblinka death camp in ukraine .
kathrin flor , a spokeswoman for the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- archives at bad arolsen , emphasized that the vast majority of the non-repatriables were innocent victims , swept up by the nazis into concentration camps , forced labor or prisoner-of-war stalags .
" many from eastern europe said , ' i will never go back , ' because they knew what stalinism meant for them .
catholic priests for example knew they could not go back to work in the baltic states , " she said .
for families and researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its was only recently opened to researchers and general public most of the documents were produced between 1947 and 1952 and are in 350,000 envelopes , usually one per family .
filed with the questionnaires are photographs , medical files , birth and marriage certificates and letters .
" the documents are of great interest for both the families of these people and for researchers , as they reveal the post-war migration movements and immigration policies of the time , " said alexander lommel , the its head of digitization .
flor said the analysis is only just starting .
the its only used the documents to trace missing people and reunite families .
the its began the scanning work in july and expects to produce 15 million images of the non-repatriables ' records by the end of next year as well as emigration lists totaling around 700,000 images .

" there has absolutely been no deal , no agreement with the chinese , " rogge told dpa news agency around ioc executive board meetings ahead of the august 8-24 games . rogge also said that " we must improve the situation , " the day after several web sites such as amnesty international were finally unblocked for the olympic media after protests . ioc spokeswoman giselle davies did not speak of " uncensored " internet access like rogge in the past , but spoke of " furthest possible access " and said the chinese had made " unprecedented moves " by unblocking some web sites for the olympic media . ioc press commission chief kevan gosper said on saturday that a working group from the ioc and the beijing organizers bocog has been set up to deal with possible further problems on the issue . better access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge says the situation must be improved for the olympic media a number of web sites are blocked by the communist government for chinese citizens but china promised that the olympic media at least have better access . the international media was furious when it noticed this week that web sites were blocked in the olympic media center , which prompted speculation of a possible deal or that the ioc had caved in to the chinese . " i was very unhappy on tuesday , " gosper told a news conference .
" censorship was being applied .

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .

britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .

" real commitment to diplomatic solution " the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
" even the americans have visibly got involved and sent a negotiator for the first time , " steinmeier told der spiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 02.08.2008 communist-era spy files made public in the czech republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many documents were destroyed or altered nearly two decades after the fall of communism in the czech republic , the government has opened an archive on the country 's secret police .
historians have criticized the decision . the czechoslovak state security -lrb- stb -rrb- files contain the names of 10,000 people that were of interest to the feared secret police .
the files , along with the names they contain , were recently made available on the internet by the prague archive of czech security agencies .
the czech republic is the only eastern european country to systematically make public information about the former secret police .
there is no english-language version of the web site or the files .
the list is only the start .
approximately 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of files pertaining to the country 's secret police have been made public .
the files contain both the names of spies as well as those of their victims .
whether to make the stb files public has been a sensitive issue in the czech republic for years .
files have long proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel opposed making the documents public since communism ended 19 years ago and the stb was shut down , there have been various efforts to shed light on this dark part of czechoslovakia 's history .
in 1990 , president vaclav havel enacted a law that prohibited former party big shots and spies from becoming civil servants .
but havel refrained from making secret police files public , as he worried that doing so would pose a risk to peace in the young democracy .
in 1992 , a former regime critic illegally published a list of former " unofficial employees " of the secret police .
besides causing a media and political storm , the scandal launched a long-running debate about whether to open up the files .
since 1996 , citizens have been allowed to see files that pertain directly to them , but the largest portion of the files remained closed .
in 2002 the parliament decided to make all documents public .
some files were altered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are skeptical that the files will prove useful but the push did n't really begin until last year under the conservative government of mirek topolanek .
it was then that the administration of the files was transferred from the interior ministry to the institute for the study of totalitarian regimes .
the institute is in turn affiliated with the state security archive .
since last year , the public has had access to nearly all of the files .
christiane brenner of collegium carolinum , a munich research center focused on bohemia , told dw-world.de that she finds the decision to be extremely problematic .
as the communist regime was falling and in the time immediately thereafter , former secret police altered and destroyed documents , brenner said .
“ that means that it 's impossible to know even today how complete this document collection is and you also do n't know about the truthfulness of its content , ” the historian said .
a treasure trove ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's decision has been controversial ivo bock of the research center for eastern european studies at the university of bremen is also skeptical .
historians are against the decision not because they oppose making the documents public per se , but because they question the significance of the documents .
“ they believe that one should not consider them the authoritative or authentic interpretation of the communist era , ” he said .
he said he thinks there is little public interest in the files nearly two decades after the end of communism .
yet the czech republic has gone about exploring its communist past more intensively than many of its neighbors . andreas leixnering -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ote wants the court to order siemens to reveal details of an internal inquiry into its activities in greece , with a view to eventually suing for damages .
greek prosecutors are investigating the 1997 contract which siemens is suspected of securing by paying 75 million dollars to ote executives .
sueddeutsche said ote would seek compensation over a letter of intent dating from 1997 which led to ote buying equipment worth 1 billion euros from siemens to improve greek phone systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation has taken a battering in another report , german news weekly der spiegel said a law firm hired by siemens to sue 11 former executives for failing to uncover and halt the scandal had already conducted a detailed inquiry .
the lawyers maintained that internal checks to prevent corruption had been " objectively faulty " as early as 2001 , spiegel said .
the affair has rocked the two main political parties in greece , the ruling new democracy conservatives and the opposition pasok socialists .
the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
the floating pontoons could be used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . dw staff -lrb- th / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
the floating pontoons could be used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . dw staff -lrb- th / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is becoming increasingly clear that structural factors like the growth in global food demand can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels over the medium-term , though substantially below the most recent price hikes , " the report from the european commission 's agriculture department said on friday , aug .
1 .
" reasons for current price pressures are unambiguous ... a combination of steadily increasing demand and lagging supply or production shortfall , exacerbated by short-term economic and policy factors , " the report said .
since the beginning of the year , alarm bells have sounded around the world at the surge in prices for basic foods .
staggering numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food prices are likely to remain relatively high , says the eu according to figures from the commission , the eu 's executive , in february wheat in the united states was 113 percent more costly than in february 2007 .
european wheat was 93 percent dearer , thai rice 52 percent more expensive and dairy products 30 percent more costly .
the figures sparked crisis talks in europe , with eu leaders debating the issue at a summit in brussels in june .
but friday 's study stresses that there is no single reason for the price rises , with long-term factors such as growing world food consumption , short-term ones such as weather and crop conditions , and external ones such as fuel prices and financial uncertainty all playing a part .
the responses the report suggests are equally varied .
they include boosting food aid to the poor , opening unused land for farming and increasing research into crop protection and yield improvements . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ote wants the court to order siemens to reveal details of an internal inquiry into its activities in greece , with a view to eventually suing for damages .
greek prosecutors are investigating the 1997 contract which siemens is suspected of securing by paying 75 million dollars to ote executives .
sueddeutsche said ote would seek compensation over a letter of intent dating from 1997 which led to ote buying equipment worth 1 billion euros from siemens to improve greek phone systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation has taken a battering in another report , german news weekly der spiegel said a law firm hired by siemens to sue 11 former executives for failing to uncover and halt the scandal had already conducted a detailed inquiry .
the lawyers maintained that internal checks to prevent corruption had been " objectively faulty " as early as 2001 , spiegel said .
the affair has rocked the two main political parties in greece , the ruling new democracy conservatives and the opposition pasok socialists .
the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief solana , left , with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili at the geneva meeting in july , the six western powers put forward an enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives .
it includes far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities .
britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures .
" real commitment to diplomatic solution " the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
" even the americans have visibly got involved and sent a negotiator for the first time , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
" it is all meant to demonstrate there really is a commitment to a diplomatic solution . "
steinmeier said he expected a clear signal in favor of a mutual suspension .
" we would then suspend our efforts for sanctions and iran would suspend the expansion of its centrifuges .
it 's a clear offer that deserves a clear answer , and a prompt one . "
the minister said it would be " negligent " not to use the opportunity .
in brussels , meanwhile , eu diplomats said saturday that the eu was still awaiting tehran 's official response to an offer of new talks to resolve the dispute over iran 's nuclear activities , and that an answer may be coming on monday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ote wants the court to order siemens to reveal details of an internal inquiry into its activities in greece , with a view to eventually suing for damages .
greek prosecutors are investigating the 1997 contract which siemens is suspected of securing by paying 75 million dollars to ote executives .
sueddeutsche said ote would seek compensation over a letter of intent dating from 1997 which led to ote buying equipment worth 1 billion euros from siemens to improve greek phone systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation has taken a battering in another report , german news weekly der spiegel said a law firm hired by siemens to sue 11 former executives for failing to uncover and halt the scandal had already conducted a detailed inquiry .
the lawyers maintained that internal checks to prevent corruption had been " objectively faulty " as early as 2001 , spiegel said .
the affair has rocked the two main political parties in greece , the ruling new democracy conservatives and the opposition pasok socialists .
the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
the floating pontoons could be used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . dw staff -lrb- th / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

historians have criticized the decision . the czechoslovak state security -lrb- stb -rrb- files contain the names of 10,000 people that were of interest to the feared secret police .
the files , along with the names they contain , were recently made available on the internet by the prague archive of czech security agencies .
the czech republic is the only eastern european country to systematically make public information about the former secret police .
there is no english-language version of the web site or the files .
the list is only the start .
approximately 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of files pertaining to the country 's secret police have been made public .
the files contain both the names of spies as well as those of their victims .
whether to make the stb files public has been a sensitive issue in the czech republic for years .
files have long proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel opposed making the documents public since communism ended 19 years ago and the stb was shut down , there have been various efforts to shed light on this dark part of czechoslovakia 's history .
in 1990 , president vaclav havel enacted a law that prohibited former party big shots and spies from becoming civil servants .
but havel refrained from making secret police files public , as he worried that doing so would pose a risk to peace in the young democracy .
in 1992 , a former regime critic illegally published a list of former " unofficial employees " of the secret police .
besides causing a media and political storm , the scandal launched a long-running debate about whether to open up the files .
since 1996 , citizens have been allowed to see files that pertain directly to them , but the largest portion of the files remained closed .
in 2002 the parliament decided to make all documents public .
some files were altered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are skeptical that the files will prove useful but the push did n't really begin until last year under the conservative government of mirek topolanek .
it was then that the administration of the files was transferred from the interior ministry to the institute for the study of totalitarian regimes .
the institute is in turn affiliated with the state security archive .
since last year , the public has had access to nearly all of the files .
christiane brenner of collegium carolinum , a munich research center focused on bohemia , told dw-world.de that she finds the decision to be extremely problematic .
as the communist regime was falling and in the time immediately thereafter , former secret police altered and destroyed documents , brenner said .
“ that means that it 's impossible to know even today how complete this document collection is and you also do n't know about the truthfulness of its content , ” the historian said .
a treasure trove ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's decision has been controversial ivo bock of the research center for eastern european studies at the university of bremen is also skeptical .
historians are against the decision not because they oppose making the documents public per se , but because they question the significance of the documents .
“ they believe that one should not consider them the authoritative or authentic interpretation of the communist era , ” he said .
he said he thinks there is little public interest in the files nearly two decades after the end of communism .
yet the czech republic has gone about exploring its communist past more intensively than many of its neighbors . andreas leixnering -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .

britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .

" we are offering iran comprehensive cooperation , " german news magazine der spiegel quoted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying in an interview released on saturday , aug 2 . " i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time , but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying . " however iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on saturday said his country would not retreat " one iota " from its nuclear rights , news agency reuters reported . iran refuses to play along western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons . iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .

now it is making images for historians of the files on 800,000 people who were dubbed the " non-repatriables " after millions of other people displaced by the nazis had joyfully returned to their old homes during 1945 and 1946 .
fewer than a third of those staying put in the west as refugees were jews .
more were people from poland , the baltic states and yugoslavia whose homelands had fallen under communist control and who feared instant death if they went home .
so they waited in dreary refugee camps all over germany , austria , italy and england for permission to emigrate .
one of the displaced-persons camps was in cinecitta , the film studios in the italian capital rome .
it took until 1952 to find most of them new homes in israel , the united states , australia or south america .
a treasure trove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its collections will be of great value to historians historians will now gain the opportunity to read a treasure trove of so-called care-and-maintenance questionnaires in which refugees describe their wartime experiences and give reasons why they wish to emigrate .
researchers may also discover a few nazi collaborators hidden among the victims , concealing war crimes from allied investigators .
john demjanjuk , 88 , currently awaiting deportation from the united states , was in displaced persons camps till he gained entry to the united states in 1952 .
he is alleged to have been a murderous ss guard at the nazis ' treblinka death camp in ukraine .
kathrin flor , a spokeswoman for the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- archives at bad arolsen , emphasized that the vast majority of the non-repatriables were innocent victims , swept up by the nazis into concentration camps , forced labor or prisoner-of-war stalags .
" many from eastern europe said , ' i will never go back , ' because they knew what stalinism meant for them .
catholic priests for example knew they could not go back to work in the baltic states , " she said .
for families and researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its was only recently opened to researchers and general public most of the documents were produced between 1947 and 1952 and are in 350,000 envelopes , usually one per family .
filed with the questionnaires are photographs , medical files , birth and marriage certificates and letters .
" the documents are of great interest for both the families of these people and for researchers , as they reveal the post-war migration movements and immigration policies of the time , " said alexander lommel , the its head of digitization .
flor said the analysis is only just starting .
the its only used the documents to trace missing people and reunite families .
the its began the scanning work in july and expects to produce 15 million images of the non-repatriables ' records by the end of next year as well as emigration lists totaling around 700,000 images .
the data will be sent to holocaust museums in washington and jerusalem .
most importantly , the images can be easily copied and saved in perpetuity , even if the yellowing paper crumbles away .
a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digitalizing the archive materials will help preserve them for posterity the its had to specially develop 15 computer work stations for the latest project because the paper sizes varied so much , from passport photos to forms on us tabloid-size sheets 432- millimeters-long .
the project follows digitalization of the stock of documents on incarceration into about 18 million images , the its name index of 42 million images and a 7-million-image index of the initial displaced persons .
another 8-million-image collection , on people press-ganged by the nazis into forced labor , is scheduled for completion this month -lrb- august 2008 -rrb- .
the newest project needs a three-person team at each work-station with one taking the fragile documents out and putting them in a device to flatten the paper , another operating the camera and lights and a third in charge of " post-processing " including numbering .
roughly 70 percent of the documents stored at the its have been scanned so far .
bad arolsen holds 50 million references to 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime on 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- of shelving .
no end in sight ?
digitalization of the entire archive is expected to be completed in 2011 .
" we 've already digitized 3.5 terabytes of data and feel there 's still no end in sight , " said michael hoffmann , head of computing .
releasing the data from six decades of secrecy took a long campaign led by us holocaust researchers , who argued that families and historians had to see the data before the last eyewitnesses died .
finally , last year , the 11 states making up the its commission agreed to relax the secrecy and directed the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- , which manages the its on their behalf , to begin making mirror copies of the bad arolsen data . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
the floating pontoons could be used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . dw staff -lrb- th / tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

historians have criticized the decision . the czechoslovak state security -lrb- stb -rrb- files contain the names of 10,000 people that were of interest to the feared secret police .
the files , along with the names they contain , were recently made available on the internet by the prague archive of czech security agencies .
the czech republic is the only eastern european country to systematically make public information about the former secret police .
there is no english-language version of the web site or the files .
the list is only the start .
approximately 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of files pertaining to the country 's secret police have been made public .
the files contain both the names of spies as well as those of their victims .
whether to make the stb files public has been a sensitive issue in the czech republic for years .
files have long proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel opposed making the documents public since communism ended 19 years ago and the stb was shut down , there have been various efforts to shed light on this dark part of czechoslovakia 's history .
in 1990 , president vaclav havel enacted a law that prohibited former party big shots and spies from becoming civil servants .
but havel refrained from making secret police files public , as he worried that doing so would pose a risk to peace in the young democracy .
in 1992 , a former regime critic illegally published a list of former " unofficial employees " of the secret police .
besides causing a media and political storm , the scandal launched a long-running debate about whether to open up the files .
since 1996 , citizens have been allowed to see files that pertain directly to them , but the largest portion of the files remained closed .
in 2002 the parliament decided to make all documents public .
some files were altered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are skeptical that the files will prove useful but the push did n't really begin until last year under the conservative government of mirek topolanek .
it was then that the administration of the files was transferred from the interior ministry to the institute for the study of totalitarian regimes .
the institute is in turn affiliated with the state security archive .
since last year , the public has had access to nearly all of the files .
christiane brenner of collegium carolinum , a munich research center focused on bohemia , told dw-world.de that she finds the decision to be extremely problematic .
as the communist regime was falling and in the time immediately thereafter , former secret police altered and destroyed documents , brenner said .
“ that means that it 's impossible to know even today how complete this document collection is and you also do n't know about the truthfulness of its content , ” the historian said .
a treasure trove ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's decision has been controversial ivo bock of the research center for eastern european studies at the university of bremen is also skeptical .
historians are against the decision not because they oppose making the documents public per se , but because they question the significance of the documents .
“ they believe that one should not consider them the authoritative or authentic interpretation of the communist era , ” he said .
he said he thinks there is little public interest in the files nearly two decades after the end of communism .
yet the czech republic has gone about exploring its communist past more intensively than many of its neighbors . andreas leixnering -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is becoming increasingly clear that structural factors like the growth in global food demand can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels over the medium-term , though substantially below the most recent price hikes , " the report from the european commission 's agriculture department said on friday , aug .
1 .
" reasons for current price pressures are unambiguous ... a combination of steadily increasing demand and lagging supply or production shortfall , exacerbated by short-term economic and policy factors , " the report said .
since the beginning of the year , alarm bells have sounded around the world at the surge in prices for basic foods .

european wheat was 93 percent dearer , thai rice 52 percent more expensive and dairy products 30 percent more costly .
the figures sparked crisis talks in europe , with eu leaders debating the issue at a summit in brussels in june .
but friday 's study stresses that there is no single reason for the price rises , with long-term factors such as growing world food consumption , short-term ones such as weather and crop conditions , and external ones such as fuel prices and financial uncertainty all playing a part .

now it is making images for historians of the files on 800,000 people who were dubbed the " non-repatriables " after millions of other people displaced by the nazis had joyfully returned to their old homes during 1945 and 1946 .
fewer than a third of those staying put in the west as refugees were jews .
more were people from poland , the baltic states and yugoslavia whose homelands had fallen under communist control and who feared instant death if they went home .
so they waited in dreary refugee camps all over germany , austria , italy and england for permission to emigrate .

john demjanjuk , 88 , currently awaiting deportation from the united states , was in displaced persons camps till he gained entry to the united states in 1952 .

now it is making images for historians of the files on 800,000 people who were dubbed the " non-repatriables " after millions of other people displaced by the nazis had joyfully returned to their old homes during 1945 and 1946 .
fewer than a third of those staying put in the west as refugees were jews .
more were people from poland , the baltic states and yugoslavia whose homelands had fallen under communist control and who feared instant death if they went home .
so they waited in dreary refugee camps all over germany , austria , italy and england for permission to emigrate .
one of the displaced-persons camps was in cinecitta , the film studios in the italian capital rome .
it took until 1952 to find most of them new homes in israel , the united states , australia or south america .
a treasure trove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its collections will be of great value to historians historians will now gain the opportunity to read a treasure trove of so-called care-and-maintenance questionnaires in which refugees describe their wartime experiences and give reasons why they wish to emigrate .
researchers may also discover a few nazi collaborators hidden among the victims , concealing war crimes from allied investigators .
john demjanjuk , 88 , currently awaiting deportation from the united states , was in displaced persons camps till he gained entry to the united states in 1952 .
he is alleged to have been a murderous ss guard at the nazis ' treblinka death camp in ukraine .
kathrin flor , a spokeswoman for the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- archives at bad arolsen , emphasized that the vast majority of the non-repatriables were innocent victims , swept up by the nazis into concentration camps , forced labor or prisoner-of-war stalags .
" many from eastern europe said , ' i will never go back , ' because they knew what stalinism meant for them .
catholic priests for example knew they could not go back to work in the baltic states , " she said .
for families and researchers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the its was only recently opened to researchers and general public most of the documents were produced between 1947 and 1952 and are in 350,000 envelopes , usually one per family .
filed with the questionnaires are photographs , medical files , birth and marriage certificates and letters .
" the documents are of great interest for both the families of these people and for researchers , as they reveal the post-war migration movements and immigration policies of the time , " said alexander lommel , the its head of digitization .
flor said the analysis is only just starting .
the its only used the documents to trace missing people and reunite families .
the its began the scanning work in july and expects to produce 15 million images of the non-repatriables ' records by the end of next year as well as emigration lists totaling around 700,000 images .
the data will be sent to holocaust museums in washington and jerusalem .
most importantly , the images can be easily copied and saved in perpetuity , even if the yellowing paper crumbles away .
a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digitalizing the archive materials will help preserve them for posterity the its had to specially develop 15 computer work stations for the latest project because the paper sizes varied so much , from passport photos to forms on us tabloid-size sheets 432- millimeters-long .
the project follows digitalization of the stock of documents on incarceration into about 18 million images , the its name index of 42 million images and a 7-million-image index of the initial displaced persons .
another 8-million-image collection , on people press-ganged by the nazis into forced labor , is scheduled for completion this month -lrb- august 2008 -rrb- .
the newest project needs a three-person team at each work-station with one taking the fragile documents out and putting them in a device to flatten the paper , another operating the camera and lights and a third in charge of " post-processing " including numbering .
roughly 70 percent of the documents stored at the its have been scanned so far .
bad arolsen holds 50 million references to 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime on 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- of shelving .
no end in sight ?
digitalization of the entire archive is expected to be completed in 2011 .
" we 've already digitized 3.5 terabytes of data and feel there 's still no end in sight , " said michael hoffmann , head of computing .
releasing the data from six decades of secrecy took a long campaign led by us holocaust researchers , who argued that families and historians had to see the data before the last eyewitnesses died .
finally , last year , the 11 states making up the its commission agreed to relax the secrecy and directed the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- , which manages the its on their behalf , to begin making mirror copies of the bad arolsen data . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 02.08.2008 communist-era spy files made public in the czech republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many documents were destroyed or altered nearly two decades after the fall of communism in the czech republic , the government has opened an archive on the country 's secret police .
historians have criticized the decision . the czechoslovak state security -lrb- stb -rrb- files contain the names of 10,000 people that were of interest to the feared secret police .
the files , along with the names they contain , were recently made available on the internet by the prague archive of czech security agencies .
the czech republic is the only eastern european country to systematically make public information about the former secret police .
there is no english-language version of the web site or the files .
the list is only the start .
approximately 19 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of files pertaining to the country 's secret police have been made public .
the files contain both the names of spies as well as those of their victims .
whether to make the stb files public has been a sensitive issue in the czech republic for years .
files have long proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel opposed making the documents public since communism ended 19 years ago and the stb was shut down , there have been various efforts to shed light on this dark part of czechoslovakia 's history .
in 1990 , president vaclav havel enacted a law that prohibited former party big shots and spies from becoming civil servants .
but havel refrained from making secret police files public , as he worried that doing so would pose a risk to peace in the young democracy .
in 1992 , a former regime critic illegally published a list of former " unofficial employees " of the secret police .
besides causing a media and political storm , the scandal launched a long-running debate about whether to open up the files .
since 1996 , citizens have been allowed to see files that pertain directly to them , but the largest portion of the files remained closed .
in 2002 the parliament decided to make all documents public .
some files were altered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are skeptical that the files will prove useful but the push did n't really begin until last year under the conservative government of mirek topolanek .
it was then that the administration of the files was transferred from the interior ministry to the institute for the study of totalitarian regimes .
the institute is in turn affiliated with the state security archive .
since last year , the public has had access to nearly all of the files .
christiane brenner of collegium carolinum , a munich research center focused on bohemia , told dw-world.de that she finds the decision to be extremely problematic .
as the communist regime was falling and in the time immediately thereafter , former secret police altered and destroyed documents , brenner said .
“ that means that it 's impossible to know even today how complete this document collection is and you also do n't know about the truthfulness of its content , ” the historian said .
a treasure trove ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's decision has been controversial ivo bock of the research center for eastern european studies at the university of bremen is also skeptical .
historians are against the decision not because they oppose making the documents public per se , but because they question the significance of the documents .
“ they believe that one should not consider them the authoritative or authentic interpretation of the communist era , ” he said .
he said he thinks there is little public interest in the files nearly two decades after the end of communism .
yet the czech republic has gone about exploring its communist past more intensively than many of its neighbors . andreas leixnering -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pilot project aims to improve water quality and make the river swimmable again by stopping sewage from pouring into the spree . the german ministry of research and technology recently announced that it will finance a 2-million-euros -lrb- $ 3.1-million -rrb- giant floating pontoon .
construction will get underway this fall .
when finished , the 1,000-square-meter -lrb- 10,800-square-foot -rrb- platform will have space for pavilions , gardens and a boat rental facility .
as many as 14 additional pontoons might be installed if the pilot project proves successful .
a dangerously dirty river the river spree travels almost 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and , as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it rains , the spree fills with sewage the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system .
in much of the city , " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . the sewage system simply ca n't contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree .
it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it .
setting an example ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks .
his pontoon solution , called " spree 2011 , " is quite simple .
the floating pontoon will serve as a large overflow tank , preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
bildunterschrift : the pontoons could have many different uses steeg has long argued that cleaning the spree was an important signal that germany , as an industrialized country , cares about the environment .
" and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into the river to cool off , " steeg told deutsche welle in 2005 , back when his plan was considered a pipe dream by many .
not only about swimming traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans aims to make the spree cleaner than it 's ever been .
the project has been championed as an aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .

ote wants the court to order siemens to reveal details of an internal inquiry into its activities in greece , with a view to eventually suing for damages .
greek prosecutors are investigating the 1997 contract which siemens is suspected of securing by paying 75 million dollars to ote executives .
sueddeutsche said ote would seek compensation over a letter of intent dating from 1997 which led to ote buying equipment worth 1 billion euros from siemens to improve greek phone systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation has taken a battering in another report , german news weekly der spiegel said a law firm hired by siemens to sue 11 former executives for failing to uncover and halt the scandal had already conducted a detailed inquiry .
the lawyers maintained that internal checks to prevent corruption had been " objectively faulty " as early as 2001 , spiegel said .
the affair has rocked the two main political parties in greece , the ruling new democracy conservatives and the opposition pasok socialists .
the greek media has speculated that officials on both sides received perks , gifts and payments from siemens slush funds .
tarnished by corruption scandal siemens , a sprawling conglomerate and one of the world 's best known companies , has been badly hit by the corruption scandal which first broke in late 2006 .
the german electronics and engineering group has purged its management and is seeking to avoid us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- fines over the misuse of corporate revenues .
the group , which employs 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations , acknowledged following an internal probe that 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- disappeared into various funds .
it said it had found evidence of violations across the company and in several countries including greece and italy .
german investigators have since determined that payments to obtain foreign contracts were a widespread practice among siemens multiple divisions .
siemens has said it is cooperating in all the investigations , and has introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there has absolutely been no deal , no agreement with the chinese , " rogge told dpa news agency around ioc executive board meetings ahead of the august 8-24 games . rogge also said that " we must improve the situation , " the day after several web sites such as amnesty international were finally unblocked for the olympic media after protests . ioc spokeswoman giselle davies did not speak of " uncensored " internet access like rogge in the past , but spoke of " furthest possible access " and said the chinese had made " unprecedented moves " by unblocking some web sites for the olympic media . ioc press commission chief kevan gosper said on saturday that a working group from the ioc and the beijing organizers bocog has been set up to deal with possible further problems on the issue . better access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge says the situation must be improved for the olympic media a number of web sites are blocked by the communist government for chinese citizens but china promised that the olympic media at least have better access . the international media was furious when it noticed this week that web sites were blocked in the olympic media center , which prompted speculation of a possible deal or that the ioc had caved in to the chinese .

" censorship was being applied .
it was clarified at the most senior level .

the web sites for the outlawed spiritual group falun gong were also blocked . gosper also dismissed claims that the ioc was to blame over the issue . " this came as a big surprise , " gosper said .
" there was uncertainty from bocog .
the ioc is not ineffective . " " in the end , bocog will fall in line with the ioc .

reports last month suggested officials of pm gordon brown and the queen were in discussions with lady thatcher 's office about arrangements .
but labour 's deputy leader harriet harman says the stories are inaccurate .
the reports are no indication of any concern for the health of the 82-year-old , who was pm from 1979 to 1990 .
ms harman told the guardian newspaper : " there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate . "
ms harman , who has been " minding the shop " during mr brown 's holiday this week , declined to say whether she thought the former conservative leader should have a state funeral .
exceptional cases state funerals are normally reserved for monarchs and reports that lady thatcher , a divisive political figure , would be given such a funeral sparked controversy .
if granted , it would make lady thatcher the first premier since sir winston churchill who was given the honour in 1965 .
concerns were also raised that not enough soldiers would be available to line the streets as her coffin was taken to st paul 's cathedral .
in the 20th century there were two other state funerals for non-royals : military commander frederick roberts and ex-ulster unionist party leader edward carson .
in the 19th century , five state funerals were granted to non-royal personages .
the exceptional cases were lord nelson after his death at trafalgar ; charles darwin ; and the duke of wellington , lord palmerston and william gladstone , three former prime ministers .
the queen mother was given a ceremonial funeral rather than a state one in 2002 as it was her husband george vi who held the throne .
in effect there is little difference between ceremonial and state funerals - with the gun carriage during a state funeral drawn by royal navy ratings rather than artillery horses .

reports last month suggested officials of pm gordon brown and the queen were in discussions with lady thatcher 's office about arrangements .
but labour 's deputy leader harriet harman says the stories are inaccurate .
the reports are no indication of any concern for the health of the 82-year-old , who was pm from 1979 to 1990 .
ms harman told the guardian newspaper : " there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate . "
ms harman , who has been " minding the shop " during mr brown 's holiday this week , declined to say whether she thought the former conservative leader should have a state funeral .
exceptional cases state funerals are normally reserved for monarchs and reports that lady thatcher , a divisive political figure , would be given such a funeral sparked controversy .
if granted , it would make lady thatcher the first premier since sir winston churchill who was given the honour in 1965 .
concerns were also raised that not enough soldiers would be available to line the streets as her coffin was taken to st paul 's cathedral .
in the 20th century there were two other state funerals for non-royals : military commander frederick roberts and ex-ulster unionist party leader edward carson .
in the 19th century , five state funerals were granted to non-royal personages .
the exceptional cases were lord nelson after his death at trafalgar ; charles darwin ; and the duke of wellington , lord palmerston and william gladstone , three former prime ministers .
the queen mother was given a ceremonial funeral rather than a state one in 2002 as it was her husband george vi who held the throne .
in effect there is little difference between ceremonial and state funerals - with the gun carriage during a state funeral drawn by royal navy ratings rather than artillery horses .

the exceptional cases were lord nelson after his death at trafalgar ; charles darwin ; and the duke of wellington , lord palmerston and william gladstone , three former prime ministers .
the queen mother was given a ceremonial funeral rather than a state one in 2002 as it was her husband george vi who held the throne .
in effect there is little difference between ceremonial and state funerals - with the gun carriage during a state funeral drawn by royal navy ratings rather than artillery horses .

certainly , when i bumped into one senior sinn fein figure at stormont the other day , he was having none of my questions about there being a crisis .
he just shook his head and declared : " do you know who i blame ? "
i could have guessed he would n't say the dup , but i let him go on .
" i blame the media . "
so , it 's all the media 's fault - although i might have pointed out that the media is only reporting the comments of his party leader who likes to use words such as " meltdown . "
at least the guns are out of the equation .
indeed the weapon of choice seems to be the implied threat of an election .
while some mlas are worried , many are convinced sinn fein is bluffing about pulling the plug as the party has no great appetite for an election .
while some mlas are worried , many are convinced sinn fein is bluffing about pulling the plug as the party has no great appetite for an election .
one sign that the dup and sinn fein may be heading for compromise is junior minister gerry kelly 's apparent shift last weekend when , during an interview for inside , he said his party was open to discussing the possibility of an alliance justice minister elected on a cross-community vote .
that is certainly different from his remarks a few years back about his party not colluding in its own exclusion .
despite deadlock over the maze , education reform , and the irish language , to name a few , there seems to be a certain underlying confidence in some quarters that all will be well .
one seasoned hack declared privately this week : " sure , you know how it will go .
we 'll be stuck up there for two nights at stormont and then it will all blow over . "
indeed , sir reg empey says he expects the prime minister to hold talks in september .
another reporter - half joking - suggested some days ago that the dup and sinn fein were having a sham fight for gordon brown to see what they can get out of him .
while this is perhaps a bit far-fetched , the two parties are no doubt attempting to draw advantage from their disagreement as they are summoned to downing street and talks with the prime minister .
some insiders are , in the meantime , trying to read sinn fein .
is there a disagreement at the top over strategy ?
is gerry adams asserting his authority ?
those who respond positively to this question suggest gerry adams wants to rattle the dup cage .

one sign that the dup and sinn fein may be heading for compromise is junior minister gerry kelly 's apparent shift last weekend when , during an interview for inside , he said his party was open to discussing the possibility of an alliance justice minister elected on a cross-community vote .
that is certainly different from his remarks a few years back about his party not colluding in its own exclusion .
despite deadlock over the maze , education reform , and the irish language , to name a few , there seems to be a certain underlying confidence in some quarters that all will be well .
one seasoned hack declared privately this week : " sure , you know how it will go .
we 'll be stuck up there for two nights at stormont and then it will all blow over . "
indeed , sir reg empey says he expects the prime minister to hold talks in september .
another reporter - half joking - suggested some days ago that the dup and sinn fein were having a sham fight for gordon brown to see what they can get out of him .
while this is perhaps a bit far-fetched , the two parties are no doubt attempting to draw advantage from their disagreement as they are summoned to downing street and talks with the prime minister .
some insiders are , in the meantime , trying to read sinn fein .
is there a disagreement at the top over strategy ?
is gerry adams asserting his authority ?
those who respond positively to this question suggest gerry adams wants to rattle the dup cage .
mr adams insists he is standing up for equality - nigel dodds insists this is code for the sinn fein president wanting his own way .
has sinn fein already decided how this is going to play ?
or are they keeping their options open ?
sir reg empey , speaking on inside politics , says stormont is heading for compromise .
" i do n't think we are in a ' crisis , crisis ' , " is how he put it .
we will known soon enough - perhaps by noon 18 september when the executive is due to meet .
