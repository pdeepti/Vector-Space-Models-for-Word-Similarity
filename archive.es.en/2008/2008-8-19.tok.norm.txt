his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .

the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .
" now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment , " he said .
the first destination for osce monitors will be gori , a georgian town south of south ossetia , to observe the withdrawal of russian forces there , the senior finnish diplomat said .
un agencies and non-governmental organizations appealed for 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.6 million -rrb- to provide relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict .

russia , a member of osce , has also become a vocal critic of the organization in recent years .
it has accused the 56-member group of being unfairly influenced by european members and the united states .
overcoming differences russia and georgia had strong disagreements about the osce mission .
russia had initially said that it wanted monitors only after its troops had withdrawn from georgia .

it 's her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world . oksana chusovitina is one of a kind .
not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an olympic medal in gymnastics , she 's been competing for nearly two decades already - that 's longer than many of her teammates have been alive . and she 's competed in five olympic games under three flags .
in 1992 , just after the dissolution of the soviet union , she joined the unified ex-soviet squad and in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country uzbekistan , where she had already become something of a national hero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chusovitina 's silver will hang next to her team gold from 1992 but this year , after claiming german citizenship in 2006 , she is a member of the german team .
germany has traditionally not been shown particular strength in gymnastics and chusovitina 's silver on sunday in vault was germany 's first olympic medal in gymnastics in 20 years - a much needed boost to the team . son 's illness shaped gymnast 's path chusovitina began her olympic career in 1992 with a team gold in barcelona .
besides coming up dry after that in atlanta , sydney and athens , the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the uzbek athlete . in 2002 , chusovitina 's son alisher , then three years old , was diagnosed with leukemia .
since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in cologne , where she had competed in the german national league , she moved to germany with her husband bakhodir kurpanov , a former successful wrestler , and their son . in cologne , chusovitina was able to train with the german team and seek medical attention for alisher .
she competed like mad in the years that followed , using her prize money to cover medical bills . claiming german citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in germany for alisher 's follow-up examinations - and it allowed her to strive for a fifth games .
chusovitina had n't abandoned her hopes for an individual . ready for london in 2012 and sunday 's silver shows that , in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies , she has only improved with age . " i do n't feel 33 , i feel 18 , " said chusovitina .
" this medal is for my son .
i ca n't say how happy i am . " and she 's not thinking about retirement .
instead , she 's got the 2012 london games on her mind . " by then i 'll be 37 ; if i can i 'll do a sixth olympics , " she said . bildunterschrift : beijing may not be her last olympic games dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .
the group was established to help bridge cultural gaps between israelis and muslims .
conflict unlikely to end soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli-palestinian relationship is full of conflict " the palestinians are less ignorant about what takes place in israel because they have been occupied by israel for more than 40 years , " barenboim said .
" but they also do n't know the history and do n't understand why the jewish people had to establish their own state following the holocaust , " he said .
despite the recent talks between israel and the palestinians , the 65-year-old barenboim does not see an early end to the middle east conflict .
" what are happening now are not serious talks , " said the buenos aires-born conductor and musician .
need historical perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace is elusive in the middle east barenboim believes that progress can only be made in reaching a middle east peace agreement when both parties to the conflict have an understanding for the other side 's history .
" we are doomed or blessed to live together or next to each other , " he said .
" when that is accepted by both sides then we can start a dialogue . "
in addition to israelis and palestinians , the musicians comprising the west-eastern divan orchestra are from syria , lebanon , egypt , iran and turkey . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .
" in fact , i saved the addresses and banking information of 1.5 million clients . " tiegel told reporters he was given the cd by his boss during a three-week stint working for a call center in the northern german city of luebeck .
the public prosecutors ' office claims the center obtained the data illegally for business purposes . the data protection commissioner for north rhine-westphalia bettina sokol has called for a general ban on the trade in personal data , which she said had spiraled out of control . " it is necessary to have a general ban for the trade in personal information such as name , address , date-of-birth or profession .
this should only be passed on for commercial purposes if a consumer has expressly given his or her permission , " she said . german data protection commissioner peter schaar also said that companies should not be allowed to hide clauses permitting the sale of such data in the small print . the trade in data is not a peccadillo , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 to beef up its monitoring mission in georgia .
but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .
osce evacuated the half dozen military monitors found assigned to south ossetia 's capital city of tskhinvali after the office building was shelled .
on tuesday , aug .
19 , after initial resistance from russia , the osce has gotten the green light to send 20 unarmed military monitors to the conflict region .
the first observers will begin arriving by the end of this week with another 70-80 expected soon after .
but it remains unclear whether the peacekeepers will be allowed in the disputed area of south ossetia .
an uneasy relationship the osce has said that peacekeepers " will be deployed immediately to the area adjacent to south ossetia , " after russia demanded that the monitors be kept out of the center of the conflict zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce wants to ensure that aid can reach people finding a consensus on where exactly observers will be allowed to go is an " extremely difficult thing , " said aleksi harkonen , the representative of finland which currently holds the osce chairmanship .
the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .
" now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment , " he said .
the first destination for osce monitors will be gori , a georgian town south of south ossetia , to observe the withdrawal of russian forces there , the senior finnish diplomat said .
un agencies and non-governmental organizations appealed for 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.6 million -rrb- to provide relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict .
russia , south ossetia unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors pulled out of tskhinvali after fighting began on monday , the president of south ossetia said he would not allow international observers back into his region .
" we have no confidence in these international observers , in these people who corrupt the truth , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity told reuters in an interview .
russia , a member of osce , has also become a vocal critic of the organization in recent years .
it has accused the 56-member group of being unfairly influenced by european members and the united states .
overcoming differences russia and georgia had strong disagreements about the osce mission .
russia had initially said that it wanted monitors only after its troops had withdrawn from georgia .
tbilisi had demanded that monitors be allowed inside south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stubb wants monitors in the conflict zone as soon as possible " the key now is to have the monitors in there , and then we 'll see how we can solve the situation in the long term , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .
the 26-year-old russian loves to flirt with the crowd .
she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .
instead , it was cosmopolitan . " i love to be alone at the top , " she said after her world record vault of 5.05 meters on monday night .
" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .

19 . " we have determined that we can not continue with business as usual , " the 26 nato foreign ministers said in a joint statement following talks in brussels .
" we call on russia to demonstrate - both in word and deed - its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship . " russia is not respecting the peace plan agreed by president dmitry medvedev , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday after a meeting of the alliance 's foreign ministers . " the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitri medvedev ... which is not happening at the moment , " he told reporters . the nato foreign ministers also agreed to create an additional nato-georgia commission to strengthen relations with tbilisi .
scheffer said the commission would function in a similar manner to an 11-year-old arrangement with ukraine but would not prejudge georgia 's prospects of entering the alliance . dialogue remains important nato , however , seemed unlikely to take drastic action , such as cutting off dialogue with moscow . russia needs to learn that it can not use force to change the borders of its neighbors , british foreign minister david miliband said ahead of the meeting . however , " i 'm not one who believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanors .

georgia has also agreed to the mission . germany demands troop pullout on aug .

russia has long provided military support to the province , which wants complete independence from georgia . moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but the situation remains tense and there were no signs tuesday that russia was withdrawing its troops as promised . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us organized the emergency nato meeting germany has called on russia to pull back its troops " at least from the heart of georgia , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday as he arrived at the nato meeting . steinmeier did not say exactly what he meant by the " heart of georgia " but the reference could be taken to mean all georgian territory apart from the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire , " steinmeier said as he arrived for a meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels . russia has engaged to withdraw its troops from georgia but there was no sign on tuesday of that happening , the georgian interior ministry said . georgia remains on nato path bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and russia have agreed to a ceasefire germany 's coordinator for russian politics , andreas schockenhoff , reiterated tuesday that germany will not change its position on georgia 's eventual membership into nato . chancellor angela merkel has made it clear to both sides that germany will support the membership action plan extended to georgia in april , a step towards georgia 's eventual membership into nato .

it is becoming more unlikely that the european central bank will cut interest rates . producer prices in germany surged in july to the highest point in nearly three decades , the country 's statistics office said tuesday .
but that did n't stop investor confidence from rebounding . annual producer prices in europe 's biggest economy climbed by 8.9 percent in july to record the fastest rise since october 1981 with the increase coming amid signs of slumping european economic growth , germany 's federal statistics office said tuesday , aug .
19 . in june , producer prices , which are considered to be an indicator of inflationary trends , had risen by an annual 6.7 percent . the european central bak raised rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent last month to help ward off resurgent inflation fuelled by high energy and food prices . annual energy prices jumped 24.5 percent in july , the german statistics office said . the latest german price data underscores the dilemma facing the ecb as it faces up to renewed inflationary pressures at a time when the global credit crunch and rising consumer prices are undercutting world economic growth . but analysts say with the ecb continuing to emphasize the importance of fighting inflation , tuesday 's jump in producer prices is likely to make it difficult for the frankfurt-based bank to ease monetary policy to help shore up growth . investors returning to markets meanwhile , german investor confidence rebounded in august , a key indicator released tuesday showed , despite concerns about the outlook for europe 's biggest economy and volatile financial markets . drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , the zew index for this month posted a surprise 8.4-point increase to minus 55.5 points . analysts had predicted that the index would fall to minus 62 points in august .
the zew july index dropped by 11.5 points to minus 63.9 points in july . the zew indicator is the first of europe 's leading monthly sentiment measures to be published for august . the publication of the zew index follows data released last week showing german economic growth contracting by 0.5 percent in the second quarter amid fears that europe could be edging its way towards a recession . but releasing the survey , zew president wolfgang franz said : " the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product growth rate in the second quarter of 2008 . " overall , they reckon with a weaker , but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .

one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .
the post would also be a way to keep muentefering from re-entering the daily political fray . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and muentefering had a good working relationship it 's unknown whether muentefering wants to be considered as a chancellor candidate to run against merkel next year .
spd head kurt beck , who has been responsible for the party 's recent move to the left , said he is respecting muentefering 's mourning period for his wife . " we have contact with one another and we will speak with one another about these questions , " beck told the ap news agency on monday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 . in june , producer prices , which are considered to be an indicator of inflationary trends , had risen by an annual 6.7 percent . the european central bak raised rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent last month to help ward off resurgent inflation fuelled by high energy and food prices . annual energy prices jumped 24.5 percent in july , the german statistics office said . the latest german price data underscores the dilemma facing the ecb as it faces up to renewed inflationary pressures at a time when the global credit crunch and rising consumer prices are undercutting world economic growth . but analysts say with the ecb continuing to emphasize the importance of fighting inflation , tuesday 's jump in producer prices is likely to make it difficult for the frankfurt-based bank to ease monetary policy to help shore up growth . investors returning to markets meanwhile , german investor confidence rebounded in august , a key indicator released tuesday showed , despite concerns about the outlook for europe 's biggest economy and volatile financial markets . drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , the zew index for this month posted a surprise 8.4-point increase to minus 55.5 points . analysts had predicted that the index would fall to minus 62 points in august .
the zew july index dropped by 11.5 points to minus 63.9 points in july . the zew indicator is the first of europe 's leading monthly sentiment measures to be published for august . the publication of the zew index follows data released last week showing german economic growth contracting by 0.5 percent in the second quarter amid fears that europe could be edging its way towards a recession . but releasing the survey , zew president wolfgang franz said : " the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product growth rate in the second quarter of 2008 . " overall , they reckon with a weaker , but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .

she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .

" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.08.2008 opinion : democracy wins battle as musharraf steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani president pervez musharraf stepped down in the face of intense political pressure .
his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 19.08.2008 zimbabwe blames runaway inflation on sanctions , biofuel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's hyperinflation is making it difficult to buy food shocking new statistics show that zimbabwe 's hyperinflation has reached the 11 million percent mark in june .
some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions . " a nato spokeswoman said ministers would deliver " a very clear message of solidarity to georgia . " meanwhile , reports regarding russia 's military activity in georgia were contradictory .
us officials said monday that russia had moved short-range missile launchers into south ossetia since fighting ceased there last week and that there was no sign of a significant pullback of its troops from georgia . russia 's defense ministry , however , on monday announced the start of its withdrawal .
the russian nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , on tuesday told france 's inter radio station that troops were pulling out of georgia . russia angered by nato criticisms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's push into georgia 's core territory has outraged the us and britain rogozin also reacted angrily to comments by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who described russia 's actions in georgia as " excessive " and " disproportionate .

" these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues .

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .
the group was established to help bridge cultural gaps between israelis and muslims .
conflict unlikely to end soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli-palestinian relationship is full of conflict " the palestinians are less ignorant about what takes place in israel because they have been occupied by israel for more than 40 years , " barenboim said .
" but they also do n't know the history and do n't understand why the jewish people had to establish their own state following the holocaust , " he said .
despite the recent talks between israel and the palestinians , the 65-year-old barenboim does not see an early end to the middle east conflict .
" what are happening now are not serious talks , " said the buenos aires-born conductor and musician .
need historical perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace is elusive in the middle east barenboim believes that progress can only be made in reaching a middle east peace agreement when both parties to the conflict have an understanding for the other side 's history .
" we are doomed or blessed to live together or next to each other , " he said .
" when that is accepted by both sides then we can start a dialogue . "
in addition to israelis and palestinians , the musicians comprising the west-eastern divan orchestra are from syria , lebanon , egypt , iran and turkey . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's an increase of some 7.8 percent from the year earlier , the association said .
board members of companies listed on germany 's dax stock exchange took home an average 4.7 million . us wins the stock-option race but while german managers have reached a pay level equal to or above that of their international counterparts , us managers still beat germans handily when it comes to stock options , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was once more germany 's top-earning manager germany 's biggest single earner was once again deutsche bank head josef ackermann .
according to dsw , his paycheck was just shy of 14 million euros in 2007 .
in second place was daimler ceo dieter zetsche with 10 million euros , followed by linde board chairman wolfgang reitzle , with 8.1 million .
postbank ceo wolfgang klein was the lowest earning head of a dax-listed company .
he took home just 1.5 million euros .
higher profits boosted pay the managers of listed companies , who are more likely to have a performance-based pay component , benefitted particularly from rising profits among german concerns .
profits were up nearly 18 percent in 2007 , the dsw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's dieter zetsche took second place in international comparisons , germany did well .
the average pay for the board chairman of a dax-listed company was above that of his french -lrb- 2.3 million euro -rrb- , swiss -lrb- 2.99 million -rrb- and even american -lrb- 3.03 million -rrb- counterparts .

it 's her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world . oksana chusovitina is one of a kind .
not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an olympic medal in gymnastics , she 's been competing for nearly two decades already - that 's longer than many of her teammates have been alive . and she 's competed in five olympic games under three flags .
in 1992 , just after the dissolution of the soviet union , she joined the unified ex-soviet squad and in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country uzbekistan , where she had already become something of a national hero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chusovitina 's silver will hang next to her team gold from 1992 but this year , after claiming german citizenship in 2006 , she is a member of the german team .

besides coming up dry after that in atlanta , sydney and athens , the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the uzbek athlete . in 2002 , chusovitina 's son alisher , then three years old , was diagnosed with leukemia .
since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in cologne , where she had competed in the german national league , she moved to germany with her husband bakhodir kurpanov , a former successful wrestler , and their son . in cologne , chusovitina was able to train with the german team and seek medical attention for alisher .
she competed like mad in the years that followed , using her prize money to cover medical bills . claiming german citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in germany for alisher 's follow-up examinations - and it allowed her to strive for a fifth games .
chusovitina had n't abandoned her hopes for an individual . ready for london in 2012 and sunday 's silver shows that , in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies , she has only improved with age . " i do n't feel 33 , i feel 18 , " said chusovitina .
" this medal is for my son .
i ca n't say how happy i am . " and she 's not thinking about retirement .

amid mixed reports , it remained unclear whether russia was fully withdrawing troops from georgia . nato ministers are expected to pledge support for georgia and criticize russian intervention into the country at the emergency meeting , which is taking place in the middle of europe 's traditional summer break . just before the ministered gathered in brussels on tuesday , aug .
19 , russian and georgian forces exchanged prisoners in an exhibition of goodwill , news agencies reported . " the process went smoothly , " georgian national security council secretary kakha lomaia said , according to reuters .
" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions . " a nato spokeswoman said ministers would deliver " a very clear message of solidarity to georgia . " meanwhile , reports regarding russia 's military activity in georgia were contradictory .
us officials said monday that russia had moved short-range missile launchers into south ossetia since fighting ceased there last week and that there was no sign of a significant pullback of its troops from georgia . russia 's defense ministry , however , on monday announced the start of its withdrawal .
the russian nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , on tuesday told france 's inter radio station that troops were pulling out of georgia . russia angered by nato criticisms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's push into georgia 's core territory has outraged the us and britain rogozin also reacted angrily to comments by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who described russia 's actions in georgia as " excessive " and " disproportionate . " de hoop scheffer 's comments were " utterly intolerable , " dmitry rogozin said in an interview with the official government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta . " these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues . " the nrc has also led nato and russia to cooperate on a practical level , such as with joint military exercises .

19 to beef up its monitoring mission in georgia .
but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .
osce evacuated the half dozen military monitors found assigned to south ossetia 's capital city of tskhinvali after the office building was shelled .
on tuesday , aug .
19 , after initial resistance from russia , the osce has gotten the green light to send 20 unarmed military monitors to the conflict region .
the first observers will begin arriving by the end of this week with another 70-80 expected soon after .
but it remains unclear whether the peacekeepers will be allowed in the disputed area of south ossetia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce wants to ensure that aid can reach people finding a consensus on where exactly observers will be allowed to go is an " extremely difficult thing , " said aleksi harkonen , the representative of finland which currently holds the osce chairmanship .
the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .
" now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment , " he said .
the first destination for osce monitors will be gori , a georgian town south of south ossetia , to observe the withdrawal of russian forces there , the senior finnish diplomat said .
un agencies and non-governmental organizations appealed for 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.6 million -rrb- to provide relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict .

" we have no confidence in these international observers , in these people who corrupt the truth , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity told reuters in an interview .
russia , a member of osce , has also become a vocal critic of the organization in recent years .
it has accused the 56-member group of being unfairly influenced by european members and the united states .
overcoming differences russia and georgia had strong disagreements about the osce mission .
russia had initially said that it wanted monitors only after its troops had withdrawn from georgia .
tbilisi had demanded that monitors be allowed inside south ossetia .

according to media reports , the country 's biggest telecommunications company , deutsche telekom , has also been affected . a call center in bremen illegally sold on information from telekom databases to third parties , according to a report on the german public radio station norddeutsche rundfunk . the telecommunications company said it had been the victim of " extremely criminal machinations . "
telekom 's databases contain the personal information of 30 million customers in total .
but the company said the call center in question , which was working on behalf of the telecommunications giant , did not have full access to its data . telekom spokesman philipp blank told the ap news agency that database screen shots had been sold on .
but he said his company had no information showing that the data had been used with any intention to defraud consumers . bigger problem than believed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information is suspected to have originated from a call center the scale of the trade in consumer data is clearly much greater than previously assumed .
the german federation of consumer agencies presented the data of 6 million citizens , including the bank account details of 4 million of them , that he had managed to buy for 850 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- . the federation chairman , gerd billen , said it had not been a " big deal " to get hold of the data over the internet .
they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .
" in fact , i saved the addresses and banking information of 1.5 million clients . " tiegel told reporters he was given the cd by his boss during a three-week stint working for a call center in the northern german city of luebeck .
the public prosecutors ' office claims the center obtained the data illegally for business purposes . the data protection commissioner for north rhine-westphalia bettina sokol has called for a general ban on the trade in personal data , which she said had spiraled out of control . " it is necessary to have a general ban for the trade in personal information such as name , address , date-of-birth or profession .
this should only be passed on for commercial purposes if a consumer has expressly given his or her permission , " she said . german data protection commissioner peter schaar also said that companies should not be allowed to hide clauses permitting the sale of such data in the small print . the trade in data is not a peccadillo , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 to beef up its monitoring mission in georgia .
but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .
osce evacuated the half dozen military monitors found assigned to south ossetia 's capital city of tskhinvali after the office building was shelled .
on tuesday , aug .
19 , after initial resistance from russia , the osce has gotten the green light to send 20 unarmed military monitors to the conflict region .
the first observers will begin arriving by the end of this week with another 70-80 expected soon after .
but it remains unclear whether the peacekeepers will be allowed in the disputed area of south ossetia .
an uneasy relationship the osce has said that peacekeepers " will be deployed immediately to the area adjacent to south ossetia , " after russia demanded that the monitors be kept out of the center of the conflict zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce wants to ensure that aid can reach people finding a consensus on where exactly observers will be allowed to go is an " extremely difficult thing , " said aleksi harkonen , the representative of finland which currently holds the osce chairmanship .
the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .
" now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment , " he said .
the first destination for osce monitors will be gori , a georgian town south of south ossetia , to observe the withdrawal of russian forces there , the senior finnish diplomat said .
un agencies and non-governmental organizations appealed for 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.6 million -rrb- to provide relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict .
russia , south ossetia unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors pulled out of tskhinvali after fighting began on monday , the president of south ossetia said he would not allow international observers back into his region .
" we have no confidence in these international observers , in these people who corrupt the truth , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity told reuters in an interview .
russia , a member of osce , has also become a vocal critic of the organization in recent years .
it has accused the 56-member group of being unfairly influenced by european members and the united states .
overcoming differences russia and georgia had strong disagreements about the osce mission .
russia had initially said that it wanted monitors only after its troops had withdrawn from georgia .
tbilisi had demanded that monitors be allowed inside south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stubb wants monitors in the conflict zone as soon as possible " the key now is to have the monitors in there , and then we 'll see how we can solve the situation in the long term , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.08.2008 expert : musharraf 's departure will aid germany-pakistan ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani president pervez musharraf officially resigned from his post on monday in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. christian wagner , head of asia research at the german institute for international and security affairs , says that the relationship between germany and pakistan can only get better . dw-world.de : what will happen to relations between germany and pakistan now that musharraf has resigned ? dr. christian wagner : i think musharraf ’ s resignation has increased the democratic structure in pakistan .
in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid mixed reports , it remained unclear whether russia was fully withdrawing troops from georgia . nato ministers are expected to pledge support for georgia and criticize russian intervention into the country at the emergency meeting , which is taking place in the middle of europe 's traditional summer break . just before the ministered gathered in brussels on tuesday , aug .
19 , russian and georgian forces exchanged prisoners in an exhibition of goodwill , news agencies reported . " the process went smoothly , " georgian national security council secretary kakha lomaia said , according to reuters .
" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions . " a nato spokeswoman said ministers would deliver " a very clear message of solidarity to georgia . " meanwhile , reports regarding russia 's military activity in georgia were contradictory .
us officials said monday that russia had moved short-range missile launchers into south ossetia since fighting ceased there last week and that there was no sign of a significant pullback of its troops from georgia . russia 's defense ministry , however , on monday announced the start of its withdrawal .
the russian nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , on tuesday told france 's inter radio station that troops were pulling out of georgia . russia angered by nato criticisms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's push into georgia 's core territory has outraged the us and britain rogozin also reacted angrily to comments by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who described russia 's actions in georgia as " excessive " and " disproportionate . " de hoop scheffer 's comments were " utterly intolerable , " dmitry rogozin said in an interview with the official government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta . " these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues . " the nrc has also led nato and russia to cooperate on a practical level , such as with joint military exercises .

19 , russian and georgian forces exchanged prisoners in an exhibition of goodwill , news agencies reported . " the process went smoothly , " georgian national security council secretary kakha lomaia said , according to reuters .
" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions .

" these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues . " the nrc has also led nato and russia to cooperate on a practical level , such as with joint military exercises .

" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions . " a nato spokeswoman said ministers would deliver " a very clear message of solidarity to georgia . " meanwhile , reports regarding russia 's military activity in georgia were contradictory .
us officials said monday that russia had moved short-range missile launchers into south ossetia since fighting ceased there last week and that there was no sign of a significant pullback of its troops from georgia . russia 's defense ministry , however , on monday announced the start of its withdrawal .
the russian nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , on tuesday told france 's inter radio station that troops were pulling out of georgia . russia angered by nato criticisms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's push into georgia 's core territory has outraged the us and britain rogozin also reacted angrily to comments by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who described russia 's actions in georgia as " excessive " and " disproportionate . " de hoop scheffer 's comments were " utterly intolerable , " dmitry rogozin said in an interview with the official government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta . " these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues . " the nrc has also led nato and russia to cooperate on a practical level , such as with joint military exercises .
but that cooperation looks increasingly at risk . joint us , canadian and russian military exercises scheduled for aug .
20 have already been cancelled - and so have joint naval exercises between russia , the us , britain and france which were originally due to take place on friday . poland under pressure meanwhile , one of the most immediate results of russia 's intervention has been to convince reluctant poland of the merits of hosting us missile interceptors on its territory .
the us missile shield , which also involves the construction of a tracking radar in the czech republic , is strongly opposed in moscow . last week , russian army generals menacingly told poland that the hosting of us missiles would turn it into a potential military target . the last nrc meeting was held in june .
on that occasion , the nato chief praised russia for its cooperation with the alliance in spite of serious disagreements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has riled moscow by agreeing to host a us missile shield last week , a request by russia for an extraordinary meeting to discuss the georgia conflict was turned down , with the alliance 's chief saying more time was needed to prepare it . and now , the us ambassador to nato , kurt volker , said tuesday 's talks in brussels will have nato allies " consider " freezing , if not abandoning the nrc altogether . " we will talk amongst ourselves about nato 's relationship with russia , " volker said in an interview with german television . drastic steps unlikely noting that several member states which were once under soviet control had expressed strong anti-russian sentiments , gates said that since nato is built on consensus , " all opinions must be taken into account . " however , few analysts expect tuesday 's meeting to come up with any drastic decisions . they argue that while eastern european countries may push for a strong response to russia 's renewed military assertiveness , western powers such as france and germany will continue to favor a more conciliatory approach , if only to protect their commercial interests . speaking at an emergency eu meeting last week , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier argued that the best strategy for the west would be to keep its channels of communication with moscow open , rather than indulge in " one-sided condemnations .

muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .
the post would also be a way to keep muentefering from re-entering the daily political fray . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and muentefering had a good working relationship it 's unknown whether muentefering wants to be considered as a chancellor candidate to run against merkel next year .
spd head kurt beck , who has been responsible for the party 's recent move to the left , said he is respecting muentefering 's mourning period for his wife .

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .
the 26-year-old russian loves to flirt with the crowd .
she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .
instead , it was cosmopolitan . " i love to be alone at the top , " she said after her world record vault of 5.05 meters on monday night .
" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dsw , his paycheck was just shy of 14 million euros in 2007 .

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .

that 's an increase of some 7.8 percent from the year earlier , the association said .
board members of companies listed on germany 's dax stock exchange took home an average 4.7 million . us wins the stock-option race but while german managers have reached a pay level equal to or above that of their international counterparts , us managers still beat germans handily when it comes to stock options , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was once more germany 's top-earning manager germany 's biggest single earner was once again deutsche bank head josef ackermann .
according to dsw , his paycheck was just shy of 14 million euros in 2007 .
in second place was daimler ceo dieter zetsche with 10 million euros , followed by linde board chairman wolfgang reitzle , with 8.1 million .
postbank ceo wolfgang klein was the lowest earning head of a dax-listed company .
he took home just 1.5 million euros .
higher profits boosted pay the managers of listed companies , who are more likely to have a performance-based pay component , benefitted particularly from rising profits among german concerns .
profits were up nearly 18 percent in 2007 , the dsw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's dieter zetsche took second place in international comparisons , germany did well .
the average pay for the board chairman of a dax-listed company was above that of his french -lrb- 2.3 million euro -rrb- , swiss -lrb- 2.99 million -rrb- and even american -lrb- 3.03 million -rrb- counterparts .
but the picture changed when stock options were added to the mix .
in switzerland , pay was increased agian by half - to an average of 6 million euros - when stock options were included .
the dsw said that except for in a very few cases , they did n't find evidence of excess pay for mangers , and argued that stronger regulatory laws are not needed . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .

despite the recent talks between israel and the palestinians , the 65-year-old barenboim does not see an early end to the middle east conflict .

" when that is accepted by both sides then we can start a dialogue . "

" we call on russia to demonstrate - both in word and deed - its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship . " russia is not respecting the peace plan agreed by president dmitry medvedev , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday after a meeting of the alliance 's foreign ministers . " the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitri medvedev ... which is not happening at the moment , " he told reporters . the nato foreign ministers also agreed to create an additional nato-georgia commission to strengthen relations with tbilisi .
scheffer said the commission would function in a similar manner to an 11-year-old arrangement with ukraine but would not prejudge georgia 's prospects of entering the alliance . dialogue remains important nato , however , seemed unlikely to take drastic action , such as cutting off dialogue with moscow . russia needs to learn that it can not use force to change the borders of its neighbors , british foreign minister david miliband said ahead of the meeting . however , " i 'm not one who believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanors .

" the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire , " steinmeier said as he arrived for a meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels . russia has engaged to withdraw its troops from georgia but there was no sign on tuesday of that happening , the georgian interior ministry said . georgia remains on nato path bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and russia have agreed to a ceasefire germany 's coordinator for russian politics , andreas schockenhoff , reiterated tuesday that germany will not change its position on georgia 's eventual membership into nato . chancellor angela merkel has made it clear to both sides that germany will support the membership action plan extended to georgia in april , a step towards georgia 's eventual membership into nato .

that 's an increase of some 7.8 percent from the year earlier , the association said .
board members of companies listed on germany 's dax stock exchange took home an average 4.7 million . us wins the stock-option race but while german managers have reached a pay level equal to or above that of their international counterparts , us managers still beat germans handily when it comes to stock options , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was once more germany 's top-earning manager germany 's biggest single earner was once again deutsche bank head josef ackermann .
according to dsw , his paycheck was just shy of 14 million euros in 2007 .
in second place was daimler ceo dieter zetsche with 10 million euros , followed by linde board chairman wolfgang reitzle , with 8.1 million .
postbank ceo wolfgang klein was the lowest earning head of a dax-listed company .
he took home just 1.5 million euros .
higher profits boosted pay the managers of listed companies , who are more likely to have a performance-based pay component , benefitted particularly from rising profits among german concerns .
profits were up nearly 18 percent in 2007 , the dsw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's dieter zetsche took second place in international comparisons , germany did well .

but the picture changed when stock options were added to the mix .
in switzerland , pay was increased agian by half - to an average of 6 million euros - when stock options were included .
the dsw said that except for in a very few cases , they did n't find evidence of excess pay for mangers , and argued that stronger regulatory laws are not needed . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .
the post would also be a way to keep muentefering from re-entering the daily political fray . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and muentefering had a good working relationship it 's unknown whether muentefering wants to be considered as a chancellor candidate to run against merkel next year .
spd head kurt beck , who has been responsible for the party 's recent move to the left , said he is respecting muentefering 's mourning period for his wife .

according to media reports , the country 's biggest telecommunications company , deutsche telekom , has also been affected . a call center in bremen illegally sold on information from telekom databases to third parties , according to a report on the german public radio station norddeutsche rundfunk . the telecommunications company said it had been the victim of " extremely criminal machinations . "
telekom 's databases contain the personal information of 30 million customers in total .
but the company said the call center in question , which was working on behalf of the telecommunications giant , did not have full access to its data . telekom spokesman philipp blank told the ap news agency that database screen shots had been sold on .
but he said his company had no information showing that the data had been used with any intention to defraud consumers . bigger problem than believed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information is suspected to have originated from a call center the scale of the trade in consumer data is clearly much greater than previously assumed .
the german federation of consumer agencies presented the data of 6 million citizens , including the bank account details of 4 million of them , that he had managed to buy for 850 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- . the federation chairman , gerd billen , said it had not been a " big deal " to get hold of the data over the internet .
they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .
" in fact , i saved the addresses and banking information of 1.5 million clients . " tiegel told reporters he was given the cd by his boss during a three-week stint working for a call center in the northern german city of luebeck .
the public prosecutors ' office claims the center obtained the data illegally for business purposes . the data protection commissioner for north rhine-westphalia bettina sokol has called for a general ban on the trade in personal data , which she said had spiraled out of control . " it is necessary to have a general ban for the trade in personal information such as name , address , date-of-birth or profession .
this should only be passed on for commercial purposes if a consumer has expressly given his or her permission , " she said . german data protection commissioner peter schaar also said that companies should not be allowed to hide clauses permitting the sale of such data in the small print . the trade in data is not a peccadillo , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to media reports , the country 's biggest telecommunications company , deutsche telekom , has also been affected . a call center in bremen illegally sold on information from telekom databases to third parties , according to a report on the german public radio station norddeutsche rundfunk . the telecommunications company said it had been the victim of " extremely criminal machinations . "
telekom 's databases contain the personal information of 30 million customers in total .
but the company said the call center in question , which was working on behalf of the telecommunications giant , did not have full access to its data . telekom spokesman philipp blank told the ap news agency that database screen shots had been sold on .
but he said his company had no information showing that the data had been used with any intention to defraud consumers . bigger problem than believed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information is suspected to have originated from a call center the scale of the trade in consumer data is clearly much greater than previously assumed .
the german federation of consumer agencies presented the data of 6 million citizens , including the bank account details of 4 million of them , that he had managed to buy for 850 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- . the federation chairman , gerd billen , said it had not been a " big deal " to get hold of the data over the internet .
they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .
" in fact , i saved the addresses and banking information of 1.5 million clients . " tiegel told reporters he was given the cd by his boss during a three-week stint working for a call center in the northern german city of luebeck .
the public prosecutors ' office claims the center obtained the data illegally for business purposes . the data protection commissioner for north rhine-westphalia bettina sokol has called for a general ban on the trade in personal data , which she said had spiraled out of control . " it is necessary to have a general ban for the trade in personal information such as name , address , date-of-birth or profession .
this should only be passed on for commercial purposes if a consumer has expressly given his or her permission , " she said . german data protection commissioner peter schaar also said that companies should not be allowed to hide clauses permitting the sale of such data in the small print . the trade in data is not a peccadillo , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .
the 26-year-old russian loves to flirt with the crowd .
she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .
instead , it was cosmopolitan . " i love to be alone at the top , " she said after her world record vault of 5.05 meters on monday night .
" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 19.08.2008 zimbabwe blames runaway inflation on sanctions , biofuel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's hyperinflation is making it difficult to buy food shocking new statistics show that zimbabwe 's hyperinflation has reached the 11 million percent mark in june .
some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .
the 26-year-old russian loves to flirt with the crowd .
she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .
instead , it was cosmopolitan . " i love to be alone at the top , " she said after her world record vault of 5.05 meters on monday night .
" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .
" being a model is a good way to earn money , which i need to concentrate on my sport - which is my real passion . " dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to media reports , the country 's biggest telecommunications company , deutsche telekom , has also been affected . a call center in bremen illegally sold on information from telekom databases to third parties , according to a report on the german public radio station norddeutsche rundfunk . the telecommunications company said it had been the victim of " extremely criminal machinations . "
telekom 's databases contain the personal information of 30 million customers in total .
but the company said the call center in question , which was working on behalf of the telecommunications giant , did not have full access to its data . telekom spokesman philipp blank told the ap news agency that database screen shots had been sold on .
but he said his company had no information showing that the data had been used with any intention to defraud consumers . bigger problem than believed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information is suspected to have originated from a call center the scale of the trade in consumer data is clearly much greater than previously assumed .
the german federation of consumer agencies presented the data of 6 million citizens , including the bank account details of 4 million of them , that he had managed to buy for 850 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- . the federation chairman , gerd billen , said it had not been a " big deal " to get hold of the data over the internet .
they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .
" in fact , i saved the addresses and banking information of 1.5 million clients . " tiegel told reporters he was given the cd by his boss during a three-week stint working for a call center in the northern german city of luebeck .
the public prosecutors ' office claims the center obtained the data illegally for business purposes . the data protection commissioner for north rhine-westphalia bettina sokol has called for a general ban on the trade in personal data , which she said had spiraled out of control . " it is necessary to have a general ban for the trade in personal information such as name , address , date-of-birth or profession .
this should only be passed on for commercial purposes if a consumer has expressly given his or her permission , " she said . german data protection commissioner peter schaar also said that companies should not be allowed to hide clauses permitting the sale of such data in the small print . the trade in data is not a peccadillo , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 to beef up its monitoring mission in georgia .
but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .
osce evacuated the half dozen military monitors found assigned to south ossetia 's capital city of tskhinvali after the office building was shelled .
on tuesday , aug .
19 , after initial resistance from russia , the osce has gotten the green light to send 20 unarmed military monitors to the conflict region .
the first observers will begin arriving by the end of this week with another 70-80 expected soon after .
but it remains unclear whether the peacekeepers will be allowed in the disputed area of south ossetia .
an uneasy relationship the osce has said that peacekeepers " will be deployed immediately to the area adjacent to south ossetia , " after russia demanded that the monitors be kept out of the center of the conflict zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce wants to ensure that aid can reach people finding a consensus on where exactly observers will be allowed to go is an " extremely difficult thing , " said aleksi harkonen , the representative of finland which currently holds the osce chairmanship .
the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .
" now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment , " he said .
the first destination for osce monitors will be gori , a georgian town south of south ossetia , to observe the withdrawal of russian forces there , the senior finnish diplomat said .
un agencies and non-governmental organizations appealed for 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.6 million -rrb- to provide relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict .
russia , south ossetia unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors pulled out of tskhinvali after fighting began on monday , the president of south ossetia said he would not allow international observers back into his region .
" we have no confidence in these international observers , in these people who corrupt the truth , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity told reuters in an interview .
russia , a member of osce , has also become a vocal critic of the organization in recent years .
it has accused the 56-member group of being unfairly influenced by european members and the united states .
overcoming differences russia and georgia had strong disagreements about the osce mission .
russia had initially said that it wanted monitors only after its troops had withdrawn from georgia .
tbilisi had demanded that monitors be allowed inside south ossetia .

it is becoming more unlikely that the european central bank will cut interest rates . producer prices in germany surged in july to the highest point in nearly three decades , the country 's statistics office said tuesday .
but that did n't stop investor confidence from rebounding . annual producer prices in europe 's biggest economy climbed by 8.9 percent in july to record the fastest rise since october 1981 with the increase coming amid signs of slumping european economic growth , germany 's federal statistics office said tuesday , aug .
19 . in june , producer prices , which are considered to be an indicator of inflationary trends , had risen by an annual 6.7 percent . the european central bak raised rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent last month to help ward off resurgent inflation fuelled by high energy and food prices . annual energy prices jumped 24.5 percent in july , the german statistics office said . the latest german price data underscores the dilemma facing the ecb as it faces up to renewed inflationary pressures at a time when the global credit crunch and rising consumer prices are undercutting world economic growth . but analysts say with the ecb continuing to emphasize the importance of fighting inflation , tuesday 's jump in producer prices is likely to make it difficult for the frankfurt-based bank to ease monetary policy to help shore up growth . investors returning to markets meanwhile , german investor confidence rebounded in august , a key indicator released tuesday showed , despite concerns about the outlook for europe 's biggest economy and volatile financial markets . drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , the zew index for this month posted a surprise 8.4-point increase to minus 55.5 points . analysts had predicted that the index would fall to minus 62 points in august .
the zew july index dropped by 11.5 points to minus 63.9 points in july . the zew indicator is the first of europe 's leading monthly sentiment measures to be published for august . the publication of the zew index follows data released last week showing german economic growth contracting by 0.5 percent in the second quarter amid fears that europe could be edging its way towards a recession . but releasing the survey , zew president wolfgang franz said : " the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product growth rate in the second quarter of 2008 . " overall , they reckon with a weaker , but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .
the post would also be a way to keep muentefering from re-entering the daily political fray . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and muentefering had a good working relationship it 's unknown whether muentefering wants to be considered as a chancellor candidate to run against merkel next year .
spd head kurt beck , who has been responsible for the party 's recent move to the left , said he is respecting muentefering 's mourning period for his wife . " we have contact with one another and we will speak with one another about these questions , " beck told the ap news agency on monday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .
the group was established to help bridge cultural gaps between israelis and muslims .
conflict unlikely to end soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli-palestinian relationship is full of conflict " the palestinians are less ignorant about what takes place in israel because they have been occupied by israel for more than 40 years , " barenboim said .
" but they also do n't know the history and do n't understand why the jewish people had to establish their own state following the holocaust , " he said .
despite the recent talks between israel and the palestinians , the 65-year-old barenboim does not see an early end to the middle east conflict .
" what are happening now are not serious talks , " said the buenos aires-born conductor and musician .
need historical perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace is elusive in the middle east barenboim believes that progress can only be made in reaching a middle east peace agreement when both parties to the conflict have an understanding for the other side 's history .
" we are doomed or blessed to live together or next to each other , " he said .
" when that is accepted by both sides then we can start a dialogue . "
in addition to israelis and palestinians , the musicians comprising the west-eastern divan orchestra are from syria , lebanon , egypt , iran and turkey . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world . oksana chusovitina is one of a kind .
not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an olympic medal in gymnastics , she 's been competing for nearly two decades already - that 's longer than many of her teammates have been alive . and she 's competed in five olympic games under three flags .
in 1992 , just after the dissolution of the soviet union , she joined the unified ex-soviet squad and in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country uzbekistan , where she had already become something of a national hero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chusovitina 's silver will hang next to her team gold from 1992 but this year , after claiming german citizenship in 2006 , she is a member of the german team .
germany has traditionally not been shown particular strength in gymnastics and chusovitina 's silver on sunday in vault was germany 's first olympic medal in gymnastics in 20 years - a much needed boost to the team . son 's illness shaped gymnast 's path chusovitina began her olympic career in 1992 with a team gold in barcelona .
besides coming up dry after that in atlanta , sydney and athens , the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the uzbek athlete . in 2002 , chusovitina 's son alisher , then three years old , was diagnosed with leukemia .
since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in cologne , where she had competed in the german national league , she moved to germany with her husband bakhodir kurpanov , a former successful wrestler , and their son . in cologne , chusovitina was able to train with the german team and seek medical attention for alisher .
she competed like mad in the years that followed , using her prize money to cover medical bills . claiming german citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in germany for alisher 's follow-up examinations - and it allowed her to strive for a fifth games .
chusovitina had n't abandoned her hopes for an individual . ready for london in 2012 and sunday 's silver shows that , in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies , she has only improved with age . " i do n't feel 33 , i feel 18 , " said chusovitina .
" this medal is for my son .
i ca n't say how happy i am . " and she 's not thinking about retirement .
instead , she 's got the 2012 london games on her mind .

and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .

moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .

not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .

democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .

it is becoming more unlikely that the european central bank will cut interest rates . producer prices in germany surged in july to the highest point in nearly three decades , the country 's statistics office said tuesday .
but that did n't stop investor confidence from rebounding . annual producer prices in europe 's biggest economy climbed by 8.9 percent in july to record the fastest rise since october 1981 with the increase coming amid signs of slumping european economic growth , germany 's federal statistics office said tuesday , aug .
19 . in june , producer prices , which are considered to be an indicator of inflationary trends , had risen by an annual 6.7 percent . the european central bak raised rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent last month to help ward off resurgent inflation fuelled by high energy and food prices . annual energy prices jumped 24.5 percent in july , the german statistics office said . the latest german price data underscores the dilemma facing the ecb as it faces up to renewed inflationary pressures at a time when the global credit crunch and rising consumer prices are undercutting world economic growth . but analysts say with the ecb continuing to emphasize the importance of fighting inflation , tuesday 's jump in producer prices is likely to make it difficult for the frankfurt-based bank to ease monetary policy to help shore up growth . investors returning to markets meanwhile , german investor confidence rebounded in august , a key indicator released tuesday showed , despite concerns about the outlook for europe 's biggest economy and volatile financial markets . drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , the zew index for this month posted a surprise 8.4-point increase to minus 55.5 points . analysts had predicted that the index would fall to minus 62 points in august .
the zew july index dropped by 11.5 points to minus 63.9 points in july . the zew indicator is the first of europe 's leading monthly sentiment measures to be published for august . the publication of the zew index follows data released last week showing german economic growth contracting by 0.5 percent in the second quarter amid fears that europe could be edging its way towards a recession . but releasing the survey , zew president wolfgang franz said : " the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product growth rate in the second quarter of 2008 . " overall , they reckon with a weaker , but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 19.08.2008 zimbabwe blames runaway inflation on sanctions , biofuel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's hyperinflation is making it difficult to buy food shocking new statistics show that zimbabwe 's hyperinflation has reached the 11 million percent mark in june .
some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .
the 26-year-old russian loves to flirt with the crowd .
she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .
instead , it was cosmopolitan . " i love to be alone at the top , " she said after her world record vault of 5.05 meters on monday night .
" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.08.2008 some german social democrats pin hopes on a political moderate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering could help unite the spd desperate to halt their recent popularity freefall , members of the germany 's social democratic party are hoping for a political comeback by their popular former deputy chancellor franz muentefering . it 's been a tough year for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its approval rating hover at around 22 percent .
muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .

muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .
the post would also be a way to keep muentefering from re-entering the daily political fray . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and muentefering had a good working relationship it 's unknown whether muentefering wants to be considered as a chancellor candidate to run against merkel next year .
spd head kurt beck , who has been responsible for the party 's recent move to the left , said he is respecting muentefering 's mourning period for his wife . " we have contact with one another and we will speak with one another about these questions , " beck told the ap news agency on monday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 19.08.2008 peacekeepers head to georgian conflict zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current ceasefire between georgia and russia is tenuous the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- got russian and georgian approval tuesday , aug .
19 to beef up its monitoring mission in georgia .
but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .
osce evacuated the half dozen military monitors found assigned to south ossetia 's capital city of tskhinvali after the office building was shelled .
on tuesday , aug .
19 , after initial resistance from russia , the osce has gotten the green light to send 20 unarmed military monitors to the conflict region .
the first observers will begin arriving by the end of this week with another 70-80 expected soon after .
but it remains unclear whether the peacekeepers will be allowed in the disputed area of south ossetia .
an uneasy relationship the osce has said that peacekeepers " will be deployed immediately to the area adjacent to south ossetia , " after russia demanded that the monitors be kept out of the center of the conflict zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce wants to ensure that aid can reach people finding a consensus on where exactly observers will be allowed to go is an " extremely difficult thing , " said aleksi harkonen , the representative of finland which currently holds the osce chairmanship .
the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .

sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself .

" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?

the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's an increase of some 7.8 percent from the year earlier , the association said .
board members of companies listed on germany 's dax stock exchange took home an average 4.7 million . us wins the stock-option race but while german managers have reached a pay level equal to or above that of their international counterparts , us managers still beat germans handily when it comes to stock options , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann was once more germany 's top-earning manager germany 's biggest single earner was once again deutsche bank head josef ackermann .
according to dsw , his paycheck was just shy of 14 million euros in 2007 .
in second place was daimler ceo dieter zetsche with 10 million euros , followed by linde board chairman wolfgang reitzle , with 8.1 million .
postbank ceo wolfgang klein was the lowest earning head of a dax-listed company .
he took home just 1.5 million euros .
higher profits boosted pay the managers of listed companies , who are more likely to have a performance-based pay component , benefitted particularly from rising profits among german concerns .
profits were up nearly 18 percent in 2007 , the dsw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's dieter zetsche took second place in international comparisons , germany did well .
the average pay for the board chairman of a dax-listed company was above that of his french -lrb- 2.3 million euro -rrb- , swiss -lrb- 2.99 million -rrb- and even american -lrb- 3.03 million -rrb- counterparts .
but the picture changed when stock options were added to the mix .
in switzerland , pay was increased agian by half - to an average of 6 million euros - when stock options were included .
the dsw said that except for in a very few cases , they did n't find evidence of excess pay for mangers , and argued that stronger regulatory laws are not needed . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.08.2008 expert : musharraf 's departure will aid germany-pakistan ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani president pervez musharraf officially resigned from his post on monday in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. christian wagner , head of asia research at the german institute for international and security affairs , says that the relationship between germany and pakistan can only get better . dw-world.de : what will happen to relations between germany and pakistan now that musharraf has resigned ? dr. christian wagner : i think musharraf ’ s resignation has increased the democratic structure in pakistan .
in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

muenterfering , for many a beloved elder statesman known for his folksy style , has been alarmed as he 's watched the slide from the sidelines .
muentefering is reportedly so concerned by his party 's direction that he announced his comeback nine months after stepping down as deputy chancellor and employment minister , according to an article published in the rheinische post on sunday , aug .
17 .
an spd spokesman would not comment immediately on the newspaper report . muentefering left politics in november 2007 , to spend time with his wife , ankepetra , who died of cancer last month .
he has not publicly commented on his future political plans . a moderate voice muentefering is known as a centrist who maintained a good working relationship with political rival chancellor angela merkel .
he was seen as a key figure in holding together the " grand coalition " made up of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union with the spd as a junior partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd does n't want to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition moderate and conservative factions of the spd , which have felt sidelined in recent months as the party has shifted leftwards , welcomed muentefering 's return . " -lsb- muentefering -rsb- is an integration figure for the party and for many voters he is simply indispensible , " spd politician johannes kahrs said . the cdu 's christian wulff said he would " greatly welcome " muentefering 's return to party leadership , citing the elder statesman 's political acumen as an asset to the coalition . not everyone loves him while muentefering will reportedly return to parliament starting in september , it remains unclear whether he will also resume a leadership role within the spd . left-leaning spd members do not want muentefering to come back .
they are pushing for the 68-year-old muentefering to take up the post as head of the party 's friedrich ebert foundation .
the influential political organization has branch offices in more than 90 countries .
the post would also be a way to keep muentefering from re-entering the daily political fray . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and muentefering had a good working relationship it 's unknown whether muentefering wants to be considered as a chancellor candidate to run against merkel next year .
spd head kurt beck , who has been responsible for the party 's recent move to the left , said he is respecting muentefering 's mourning period for his wife . " we have contact with one another and we will speak with one another about these questions , " beck told the ap news agency on monday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 to beef up its monitoring mission in georgia .
but the osce might not get the access it wants . for more than 10 years , the osce maintained a small field office in south ossetia , a breakaway region of georgia that has seen periodic fighting in the years following the disintegration of the soviet union .
yet after fighting between russia and georgia broke out earlier this month , the osce found itself in the line of fire .
osce evacuated the half dozen military monitors found assigned to south ossetia 's capital city of tskhinvali after the office building was shelled .
on tuesday , aug .
19 , after initial resistance from russia , the osce has gotten the green light to send 20 unarmed military monitors to the conflict region .
the first observers will begin arriving by the end of this week with another 70-80 expected soon after .
but it remains unclear whether the peacekeepers will be allowed in the disputed area of south ossetia .
an uneasy relationship the osce has said that peacekeepers " will be deployed immediately to the area adjacent to south ossetia , " after russia demanded that the monitors be kept out of the center of the conflict zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce wants to ensure that aid can reach people finding a consensus on where exactly observers will be allowed to go is an " extremely difficult thing , " said aleksi harkonen , the representative of finland which currently holds the osce chairmanship .
the conflict started when georgia launched a military offensive against south ossetia , an area closely allied to russia .
moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but russia has been slow to withdraw its troops . on tuesday , russian president dmitry medvedev promised to withdraw all but 500 russian troops from georgia by friday , according to french president nicolas sarkozy 's office . humanitarian aid a priority the job of the unarmed osce officers will be to observe the ceasefire between georgia and russia , thereby paving the way for humanitarian organizations to come to the conflict zone , finland 's harkonen said .
" now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment , " he said .
the first destination for osce monitors will be gori , a georgian town south of south ossetia , to observe the withdrawal of russian forces there , the senior finnish diplomat said .
un agencies and non-governmental organizations appealed for 40 million euros -lrb- $ 58.6 million -rrb- to provide relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict .
russia , south ossetia unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors pulled out of tskhinvali after fighting began on monday , the president of south ossetia said he would not allow international observers back into his region .
" we have no confidence in these international observers , in these people who corrupt the truth , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity told reuters in an interview .
russia , a member of osce , has also become a vocal critic of the organization in recent years .
it has accused the 56-member group of being unfairly influenced by european members and the united states .

according to media reports , the country 's biggest telecommunications company , deutsche telekom , has also been affected . a call center in bremen illegally sold on information from telekom databases to third parties , according to a report on the german public radio station norddeutsche rundfunk . the telecommunications company said it had been the victim of " extremely criminal machinations . "
telekom 's databases contain the personal information of 30 million customers in total .
but the company said the call center in question , which was working on behalf of the telecommunications giant , did not have full access to its data . telekom spokesman philipp blank told the ap news agency that database screen shots had been sold on .
but he said his company had no information showing that the data had been used with any intention to defraud consumers . bigger problem than believed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information is suspected to have originated from a call center the scale of the trade in consumer data is clearly much greater than previously assumed .
the german federation of consumer agencies presented the data of 6 million citizens , including the bank account details of 4 million of them , that he had managed to buy for 850 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- . the federation chairman , gerd billen , said it had not been a " big deal " to get hold of the data over the internet .
they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are .

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire , " steinmeier said as he arrived for a meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels . russia has engaged to withdraw its troops from georgia but there was no sign on tuesday of that happening , the georgian interior ministry said . georgia remains on nato path bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and russia have agreed to a ceasefire germany 's coordinator for russian politics , andreas schockenhoff , reiterated tuesday that germany will not change its position on georgia 's eventual membership into nato . chancellor angela merkel has made it clear to both sides that germany will support the membership action plan extended to georgia in april , a step towards georgia 's eventual membership into nato .

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .
the group was established to help bridge cultural gaps between israelis and muslims .

" but they also do n't know the history and do n't understand why the jewish people had to establish their own state following the holocaust , " he said .
despite the recent talks between israel and the palestinians , the 65-year-old barenboim does not see an early end to the middle east conflict .
" what are happening now are not serious talks , " said the buenos aires-born conductor and musician .

" we are doomed or blessed to live together or next to each other , " he said .
" when that is accepted by both sides then we can start a dialogue . "

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .
political stalemate continues a summit of southern african leaders in johannesburg at the weekend failed to convince mugabe and the donor-backed tsvangirai to agree on a government of national unity , seen as the only solution to zimbabwe 's woes .
the two leaders disagree on what powers mugabe would retain if tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
western powers such as britain and the us are standing by to plough money into zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but only if tsvangirai , who took the most votes in the last credible presidential election in march , takes over the reins of power . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.08.2008 expert : musharraf 's departure will aid germany-pakistan ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani president pervez musharraf officially resigned from his post on monday in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. christian wagner , head of asia research at the german institute for international and security affairs , says that the relationship between germany and pakistan can only get better . dw-world.de : what will happen to relations between germany and pakistan now that musharraf has resigned ? dr. christian wagner : i think musharraf ’ s resignation has increased the democratic structure in pakistan .
in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .
the group was established to help bridge cultural gaps between israelis and muslims .
conflict unlikely to end soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli-palestinian relationship is full of conflict " the palestinians are less ignorant about what takes place in israel because they have been occupied by israel for more than 40 years , " barenboim said .
" but they also do n't know the history and do n't understand why the jewish people had to establish their own state following the holocaust , " he said .
despite the recent talks between israel and the palestinians , the 65-year-old barenboim does not see an early end to the middle east conflict .
" what are happening now are not serious talks , " said the buenos aires-born conductor and musician .
need historical perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace is elusive in the middle east barenboim believes that progress can only be made in reaching a middle east peace agreement when both parties to the conflict have an understanding for the other side 's history .
" we are doomed or blessed to live together or next to each other , " he said .
" when that is accepted by both sides then we can start a dialogue . "
in addition to israelis and palestinians , the musicians comprising the west-eastern divan orchestra are from syria , lebanon , egypt , iran and turkey . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has not lived up to an eu-brokered peace deal , the alliance said . nato 's 26 foreign ministers toughened their stance against russia at an emergency meeting called by the united states on tuesday , aug .
19 . " we have determined that we can not continue with business as usual , " the 26 nato foreign ministers said in a joint statement following talks in brussels .
" we call on russia to demonstrate - both in word and deed - its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship . " russia is not respecting the peace plan agreed by president dmitry medvedev , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday after a meeting of the alliance 's foreign ministers . " the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitri medvedev ... which is not happening at the moment , " he told reporters . the nato foreign ministers also agreed to create an additional nato-georgia commission to strengthen relations with tbilisi .
scheffer said the commission would function in a similar manner to an 11-year-old arrangement with ukraine but would not prejudge georgia 's prospects of entering the alliance . dialogue remains important nato , however , seemed unlikely to take drastic action , such as cutting off dialogue with moscow . russia needs to learn that it can not use force to change the borders of its neighbors , british foreign minister david miliband said ahead of the meeting . however , " i 'm not one who believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanors .
i think that the right response is hard-headed engagement , " he said , without specifying how he would want this put into action . russia agrees to monitoring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has not yet left georgia as promised the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will immediately dispatch 20 unarmed observers to tbilisi , after russia reportedly agreed to the monitoring mission tuesday morning . the organization 's team will supplement the current nine osce observers already based in south ossetia , finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said , speaking on the sidelines of the nato meeting . the osce had previously said it wants to send an additional 80 monitors to the area in the next few days .
both russia and georgia are members of the osce .
georgia has also agreed to the mission . germany demands troop pullout on aug .
8 , georgia launched a military offensive against its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has long provided military support to the province , which wants complete independence from georgia . moscow put a stop to the georgian operation , sending troops , tanks and warplanes into the area .
both sides have signed a ceasefire agreement , but the situation remains tense and there were no signs tuesday that russia was withdrawing its troops as promised . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us organized the emergency nato meeting germany has called on russia to pull back its troops " at least from the heart of georgia , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday as he arrived at the nato meeting . steinmeier did not say exactly what he meant by the " heart of georgia " but the reference could be taken to mean all georgian territory apart from the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire , " steinmeier said as he arrived for a meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels . russia has engaged to withdraw its troops from georgia but there was no sign on tuesday of that happening , the georgian interior ministry said . georgia remains on nato path bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia and russia have agreed to a ceasefire germany 's coordinator for russian politics , andreas schockenhoff , reiterated tuesday that germany will not change its position on georgia 's eventual membership into nato . chancellor angela merkel has made it clear to both sides that germany will support the membership action plan extended to georgia in april , a step towards georgia 's eventual membership into nato . " georgia can become a member of nato , " schockenhoff said in an interview in tuesday 's edition of the berliner zeitung newspaper .

it 's her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world . oksana chusovitina is one of a kind .
not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an olympic medal in gymnastics , she 's been competing for nearly two decades already - that 's longer than many of her teammates have been alive . and she 's competed in five olympic games under three flags .
in 1992 , just after the dissolution of the soviet union , she joined the unified ex-soviet squad and in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country uzbekistan , where she had already become something of a national hero . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chusovitina 's silver will hang next to her team gold from 1992 but this year , after claiming german citizenship in 2006 , she is a member of the german team .
germany has traditionally not been shown particular strength in gymnastics and chusovitina 's silver on sunday in vault was germany 's first olympic medal in gymnastics in 20 years - a much needed boost to the team . son 's illness shaped gymnast 's path chusovitina began her olympic career in 1992 with a team gold in barcelona .
besides coming up dry after that in atlanta , sydney and athens , the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the uzbek athlete . in 2002 , chusovitina 's son alisher , then three years old , was diagnosed with leukemia .
since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in cologne , where she had competed in the german national league , she moved to germany with her husband bakhodir kurpanov , a former successful wrestler , and their son . in cologne , chusovitina was able to train with the german team and seek medical attention for alisher .
she competed like mad in the years that followed , using her prize money to cover medical bills . claiming german citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in germany for alisher 's follow-up examinations - and it allowed her to strive for a fifth games .
chusovitina had n't abandoned her hopes for an individual . ready for london in 2012 and sunday 's silver shows that , in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies , she has only improved with age . " i do n't feel 33 , i feel 18 , " said chusovitina .
" this medal is for my son .
i ca n't say how happy i am . " and she 's not thinking about retirement .
instead , she 's got the 2012 london games on her mind .

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .
they forced musharraf to step down as commander in chief of the army this past autumn , and made him hold free elections in february . in the end , it was a democratic movement , and it lends musharraf 's resignation on monday , aug .
18 , historic dimensions .
democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .
but musharraf 's extreme isolation meant he could n't even resort to that option . the power struggle was n't only between democrats and musharraf .
his power had a lot to do with the political role of the army .
his resignation is likely to strengthen civil institutions in relation to the armed forces over the long term . what has musharraf left behind ?
in the end , the legacy of his rule appears likely to be more positive than it would currently appear . musharraf brought about a singular liberalization , particularly in the electronic media sector - even if he sometimes did it against his will .
society modernized thanks to a long-lasting economic revival .
moderates in pakistan are clearly stronger than they were before his putsch in 1999 .
musharraf also played a decisive role in the peace process with neighboring india , where he is significantly more popular than he is at home . strengthening islamic militants on the negative side , there were authoritarian and often contradictory policies , especially in the so-called war on terror .
under musharraf , pakistani intelligence officers let hundreds of their countrymen " disappear . "
sometimes the air force would bomb supposed militant enclaves .
but there was also the unmistakable feeling that the intelligence community supported extremists , when that would play a useful role in internal political power struggles . this turned out to be a terribly counterproductive course of action when it came to dealing with extremist ideologues and militant insurgents like the taliban .
it made the islamists martyrs in the eyes of many , and gave most pakistanis the impression that the battle against the taliban was only being waged on washington 's orders . the only way out of this is true democracy .
the parliament and the independent court system must be strengthened in order to stand up to the strong domestic and foreign forces that are used to pulling the behind-the-scenes strings of pakistani politics . musharraf 's political heirs are inheriting an enormous responsibility . thomas baerthlein is the deputy head of the south asia service at deutsche welle -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his legacy is likely to be better than expected , argues dw 's thomas baerthlein .
but there is still much to be achieved . pervez musharraf has recognized - rather late - that the game is over . in the end , there was no one left to support him .
not the parliamentarians in his own party .
not the army , which he led for more than a decade .
not his long-time allies washington , george bush and dick cheney .
and above all , not the pakistani people , some 80 percent of whom demanded his resignation , according to the most recent polls . musharraf 's tactics worked for nearly a decade , and put him at the top of political power .
his crowning achievement was to sell himself to the west as their indispensible ally in the " war on terror , " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in pakistan , where many people celebrated his putsch , he remained popular for a long time , above all among middle and upper-class liberals .
they saw him as a moderate reformer who would reign in putative radical islamists . of course , the influential military also profited a great deal under the long leadership of the general , especially financially . a difficult opponent in chaudhry but in march 2007 , his political structures started to collapse like a house of cards .
it became clearer and clearer that pervez musharraf had but a single political interest : pervez musharraf . the president took on pakistan 's chief justice iftikhar chaudhry , who was becoming too independent for his tastes - and who consistently appealed for the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein not only the judges and lawyers , but the media , civic society , political parties and hundreds of thousands of citizens showed solidarity with chaudhry .

democracy in pakistan has won a dramatic power struggle . army 's political role is changing the pakistani constitution is contradictory in that , on the one hand , it gives parliament the possibility to impeach its president , but also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament .

some athletes , like russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva flirt with the crowd , while others , like us swimmer amanda beard , take all their clothes off .
sex sells , but can it boost a sports career ? germany 's playboy magazine has four olympic athletes revealing all in its current edition - canoeist nicole reinhardt , hockey player katharina scholz , sailor petra niemann and judoka romy tarangul .
beijing fencing gold medalist britta heidemann posed for the same magazine four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hockey is sexy , " scholz said and many agree " for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it , " 25-year-old scholz said of the nude photo shoot .
" not everybody can go on the cover of playboy ; i did it because i am confident of my body and myself . " beard , meanwhile , who posed for playboy last year , shed her clothes to support people for the ethical treatment of animals ' ad campaign calling on consumers to forego fur . whether or not they bare all , however , many of the 10,500 young athletes in beijing 's olympic village are conscious of their sex appeal . for some , a sexy image can promote their sport . as if bikini-clad players were n't enough , scantily dressed dancers perform during the breaks at beach volleyball matches in chaoyang park .
there is even a rule in indoor volleyball on what women have to wear on the court to spice up their appearance . sex appeal ca n't buy fans but showing skin is n't always beneficial to sports , according to american professor mary jo kane , who conducts research on girls and women in sports . " the question is : does sex sell ? " she told the german dpa news agency .
" it sells magazines and products .
does it translate into greater interest and respect in women 's sports ?
the answer is , unequivocally , it does not . " the assumption is that sex sells .
the assumption is , for women 's sports to survive , you have to attract the real fans , which are male fans .
and you have to attract them with how pretty and sexy they are . " some sexier than others competitors in the more popular sports have a natural advantage , when it comes to wooing fans . track and field , for instance , is erotic per se , with athletes contorting their bodies into graceful arcs on the beijing track to rock music from pearl jam or green day blaring over the sound system . many remember the long fingernails of the late florence griffith joyner or gail devers , both former us olympic runners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole vaulter isinbayeva makes the most of her sex appeal but it is russia 's yelena isinbayeva , who has taken the art of flirting , and the sport of pole vaulting , to unsurpassable heights .
the 26-year-old russian loves to flirt with the crowd .
she blows kisses , smiles , and does summersaults after world records . she has n't appeared on the cover of playboy .
instead , it was cosmopolitan . " i love to be alone at the top , " she said after her world record vault of 5.05 meters on monday night .
" it 's so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible . " at least there 's money in it there is also leryn franco , a model and javelin thrower from paraguay , who crashed out on tuesday in qualifying .
for her , being sexy is n't about winning fans , it 's just a means to an end . " i have done campaigns for many companies , " she said .
" being a model is a good way to earn money , which i need to concentrate on my sport - which is my real passion . " dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to media reports , the country 's biggest telecommunications company , deutsche telekom , has also been affected . a call center in bremen illegally sold on information from telekom databases to third parties , according to a report on the german public radio station norddeutsche rundfunk . the telecommunications company said it had been the victim of " extremely criminal machinations . "
telekom 's databases contain the personal information of 30 million customers in total .
but the company said the call center in question , which was working on behalf of the telecommunications giant , did not have full access to its data . telekom spokesman philipp blank told the ap news agency that database screen shots had been sold on .
but he said his company had no information showing that the data had been used with any intention to defraud consumers . bigger problem than believed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information is suspected to have originated from a call center the scale of the trade in consumer data is clearly much greater than previously assumed .
the german federation of consumer agencies presented the data of 6 million citizens , including the bank account details of 4 million of them , that he had managed to buy for 850 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- . the federation chairman , gerd billen , said it had not been a " big deal " to get hold of the data over the internet .
they mainly came from a lottery company , but also from mobile phone contracts and charitable organizations . the federation urged people to be more careful with their personal details . tip of the iceberg last week , the consumer agency in schleswig-holstein was sent a cd-rom with 17,000 people 's personal details , including name , date-of-birth , telephone numbers , addresses and bank account information .
in some cases , money had been withdrawn from their accounts without their permission . the man who passed on the information claimed on monday that this represents just a fraction of the data in his possession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the information included consumers ' telephone and bank account numbers " it was only the first chunk of data , " detlef tiegel told the german news magazine spiegel .
" in fact , i saved the addresses and banking information of 1.5 million clients . " tiegel told reporters he was given the cd by his boss during a three-week stint working for a call center in the northern german city of luebeck .
the public prosecutors ' office claims the center obtained the data illegally for business purposes . the data protection commissioner for north rhine-westphalia bettina sokol has called for a general ban on the trade in personal data , which she said had spiraled out of control .

amid mixed reports , it remained unclear whether russia was fully withdrawing troops from georgia . nato ministers are expected to pledge support for georgia and criticize russian intervention into the country at the emergency meeting , which is taking place in the middle of europe 's traditional summer break . just before the ministered gathered in brussels on tuesday , aug .
19 , russian and georgian forces exchanged prisoners in an exhibition of goodwill , news agencies reported . " the process went smoothly , " georgian national security council secretary kakha lomaia said , according to reuters .
" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions . " a nato spokeswoman said ministers would deliver " a very clear message of solidarity to georgia . " meanwhile , reports regarding russia 's military activity in georgia were contradictory .
us officials said monday that russia had moved short-range missile launchers into south ossetia since fighting ceased there last week and that there was no sign of a significant pullback of its troops from georgia . russia 's defense ministry , however , on monday announced the start of its withdrawal .
the russian nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , on tuesday told france 's inter radio station that troops were pulling out of georgia . russia angered by nato criticisms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's push into georgia 's core territory has outraged the us and britain rogozin also reacted angrily to comments by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who described russia 's actions in georgia as " excessive " and " disproportionate . " de hoop scheffer 's comments were " utterly intolerable , " dmitry rogozin said in an interview with the official government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta . " these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues . " the nrc has also led nato and russia to cooperate on a practical level , such as with joint military exercises .
but that cooperation looks increasingly at risk . joint us , canadian and russian military exercises scheduled for aug .
20 have already been cancelled - and so have joint naval exercises between russia , the us , britain and france which were originally due to take place on friday . poland under pressure meanwhile , one of the most immediate results of russia 's intervention has been to convince reluctant poland of the merits of hosting us missile interceptors on its territory .
the us missile shield , which also involves the construction of a tracking radar in the czech republic , is strongly opposed in moscow . last week , russian army generals menacingly told poland that the hosting of us missiles would turn it into a potential military target . the last nrc meeting was held in june .
on that occasion , the nato chief praised russia for its cooperation with the alliance in spite of serious disagreements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has riled moscow by agreeing to host a us missile shield last week , a request by russia for an extraordinary meeting to discuss the georgia conflict was turned down , with the alliance 's chief saying more time was needed to prepare it . and now , the us ambassador to nato , kurt volker , said tuesday 's talks in brussels will have nato allies " consider " freezing , if not abandoning the nrc altogether . " we will talk amongst ourselves about nato 's relationship with russia , " volker said in an interview with german television . drastic steps unlikely noting that several member states which were once under soviet control had expressed strong anti-russian sentiments , gates said that since nato is built on consensus , " all opinions must be taken into account . " however , few analysts expect tuesday 's meeting to come up with any drastic decisions . they argue that while eastern european countries may push for a strong response to russia 's renewed military assertiveness , western powers such as france and germany will continue to favor a more conciliatory approach , if only to protect their commercial interests . speaking at an emergency eu meeting last week , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier argued that the best strategy for the west would be to keep its channels of communication with moscow open , rather than indulge in " one-sided condemnations .

amid mixed reports , it remained unclear whether russia was fully withdrawing troops from georgia . nato ministers are expected to pledge support for georgia and criticize russian intervention into the country at the emergency meeting , which is taking place in the middle of europe 's traditional summer break . just before the ministered gathered in brussels on tuesday , aug .
19 , russian and georgian forces exchanged prisoners in an exhibition of goodwill , news agencies reported . " the process went smoothly , " georgian national security council secretary kakha lomaia said , according to reuters .
" it was mediated by the french ambassador . the nato meeting , called by the united states , comes amid warnings from washington that the kremlin risks compromising its role in western institutions such as nato , the world trade organization and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- because of its military activity in georgia and in the breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia . " in recent years , russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic and security structures of the 21st century , " us president george w. bush said last week . " now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions . " a nato spokeswoman said ministers would deliver " a very clear message of solidarity to georgia . " meanwhile , reports regarding russia 's military activity in georgia were contradictory .
us officials said monday that russia had moved short-range missile launchers into south ossetia since fighting ceased there last week and that there was no sign of a significant pullback of its troops from georgia . russia 's defense ministry , however , on monday announced the start of its withdrawal .
the russian nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , on tuesday told france 's inter radio station that troops were pulling out of georgia . russia angered by nato criticisms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's push into georgia 's core territory has outraged the us and britain rogozin also reacted angrily to comments by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who described russia 's actions in georgia as " excessive " and " disproportionate . " de hoop scheffer 's comments were " utterly intolerable , " dmitry rogozin said in an interview with the official government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta . " these are not credible allegations , especially coming from the head of an organization like nato , which has itself used not just disproportionate force , but force against civilian targets and the civilian population , especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 , " the envoy added in an interview which was published on monday . nato-russia council soon a thing of the past ? one obvious repercussion may well involve the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- . established at a summit in rome in 2002 , the nrc has often been defended by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as " a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues . " the nrc has also led nato and russia to cooperate on a practical level , such as with joint military exercises .
but that cooperation looks increasingly at risk . joint us , canadian and russian military exercises scheduled for aug .
20 have already been cancelled - and so have joint naval exercises between russia , the us , britain and france which were originally due to take place on friday . poland under pressure meanwhile , one of the most immediate results of russia 's intervention has been to convince reluctant poland of the merits of hosting us missile interceptors on its territory .
the us missile shield , which also involves the construction of a tracking radar in the czech republic , is strongly opposed in moscow . last week , russian army generals menacingly told poland that the hosting of us missiles would turn it into a potential military target . the last nrc meeting was held in june .

the us missile shield , which also involves the construction of a tracking radar in the czech republic , is strongly opposed in moscow . last week , russian army generals menacingly told poland that the hosting of us missiles would turn it into a potential military target . the last nrc meeting was held in june .

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the coming weeks we will see a shifting of power in both parliament and the rest of the government .
the political parties are going to concern themselves with attempting to reduce the power of the office of the president .
this increase in democracy is certainly in germany ’ s interests , and should help in the battle against terrorism . there are two main front runners for the presidency : ashfaq parvez kayani and nawaz sharif .
are either of them currently in the lead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. wagner believes that relations will improve that will depend largely on what responsibilities will come along with the office of the president .
i assume that the powers of the president will be greatly reduced .
that means that the next president will presumably only have symbolic duties .
he won ’ t have the complete power which musharraf had to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister .
that will certainly no longer happen .
therefore i think it depends on whether both parties can agree on a common candidate or if each party will nominate there own , leading to a runoff election for the presidency . do you believe there is a better candidate from a german or eu perspective ? no , there isn ’ t really a better or worse candidate when it comes to a german or eu perspective .
i think what is really critical for germany and the eu is that now that musharraf has resigned , there is more hope for the democratic structure in pakistan .
however , you have to take into account that we will probably see a lot of instability in pakistan in the coming weeks .
up to now the greatest wish of the political coalition was the resignation of the president .
now that that ’ s happened , the riffs in the two main parties will once again become evident .
so because of that , i really believe that in the coming weeks we are going to see some serious political instability . how much influence will germany and the eu have over who becomes the next president ? well once again i think it means a lot for germany and the eu that democracy in pakistan is on the rise .
we had a taste of this in february with the election .
now with the resignation of musharraf the real power can be concentrated in parliament and the rest of the government .
that is certainly in germany ’ s interests , because with it the battle against terrorism in pakistan will now have a greater political legitimacy . how does the relationship between germany and pakistan look for the future ? i think germany and pakistan have had a very long and good relationship .
that is mainly due to an economic alliance .
in the past few years , germany has increasingly invested in education in the country .
germany is involved in the construction of a university in pakistan .
in the case of the eu , the relationship with pakistan is naturally not only due to economic reasons , but also to the relationship with afghanistan .
i think pakistan will be forced into taking action in the tribal areas to keep terrorists from infiltrating into pakistan from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 3,500 german soldiers in afghanistan there are currently some 3,500 german soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
do you believe with the unrest that is sure to occur in pakistan that more german troops will be required in the region ? there have been times when the us has conducted direct military actions against both al qaeda and the taliban along the border between pakistan und afghanistan .
up to now those actions have been condemned by the pakistani government .
i believe that the new government will comply with the actions conducted by western nations .
so i think the war on terrorism will continue to be fought from pakistan .
it would also be preferable for more cooperation between pakistani forces and the allied troops in afghanistan . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 19.08.2008 zimbabwe blames runaway inflation on sanctions , biofuel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's hyperinflation is making it difficult to buy food shocking new statistics show that zimbabwe 's hyperinflation has reached the 11 million percent mark in june .
some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .
the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment .
faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .
one us dollar was fetching up to 800 billion zimbabwean dollars at the time .
zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .

some say the actual figure is even higher . zimbabwe 's finance minister samuel mumbengegwi blamed the surge in inflation on rising food prices and western sanctions targeting the country 's ruling elite in an interview on tuesday , aug .
19 .
mumbengegwi said zimbabwe was not the only country to suffer inflation and placed part of the blame on the increasing use of biofuels .
" while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel , " said mumbengegwi .
price controls continue " but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic , " he said , referring to controversial government price controls on some foods , which critics say are forcing producers to shut up shop , worsening dire food shortages .
in a statement circulated on tuesday , zimbabwe 's central statistical office said inflation had hit 11.2 million percent in june , the world 's highest .
the rate compares with an official inflation figure of 2.2 million percent for may , a figure that had been deemed unrealistically low .
some analysts say 11.2 million per cent is also conservative .
dropping zeros last week , one of the zimbabwe 's leading banks - kingdom bank -estimated inflation now exceeds 20 million percent .

faced with critical cash shortages , zimbabwe 's reserve bank at the end of july slashed ten zeroes from the zimbabwe dollar .

zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of southern africa , has been in economic free fall since president robert mugabe embarked on a chaotic land reform program in 2000 that severely damaged commercial agriculture .
mugabe has blamed european union and united states sanctions targeting mainly him and other members of his zanu-pf party for the situation .
analysts say the crisis has worsened following mugabe 's disputed and violent re-election in a june 27 presidential run-off that was boycotted by his challenger morgan tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters .

both sides need to understand the other 's history , barenboim said . speaking ahead of a performance in berlin of the israeli-arab youth orchestra he co-founded in 1999 , barenboim said that israel was " ignorant " of palestinian life and that " it lacked curiosity " about the palestinian people .
" a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is , " said barenboim , who is the musical director of berlin 's showcase opera house , the staatsoper unter den linden .
the 120 members of barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra , which barenboim established along with the late palestinian writer edward said , are currently touring europe .
the group was established to help bridge cultural gaps between israelis and muslims .

mrs greenwald says being haredi means being someone who fears god sitting on a park bench in the late afternoon , michal greenwald watches her children run around the playground with dozens of other kids as she takes a few minutes rest from her hectic day .
a full-time property lawyer , mrs greenwald is the sole breadwinner and also takes care of her four young children and tends to the housework .
her husband , shmuel , spends his days studying in a religious seminary for men .
she says she can not imagine life any other way .
' ' girls are raised this way from a young age , and such are the lives of haredim in israel , " she says of the ultra-orthodox jews who choose to live separately from mainstream israeli society .
it is difficult to walk the streets of jerusalem without running into haredim , but their community can seem isolated and closed .
the men are distinct in their long black wool coats and trousers , stark white button-down shirts and black hats , even in the heat of the middle eastern summer .
living ' with a purpose ' mrs greenwald , 34 , lives in har nof , an ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of jerusalem where absolutely everything is closed on saturday - the sabbath - and only kosher food is sold in shops .
we look different , in fact we look very weird - we dress how people used to dress 100 years ago moshe eliahu haredi student and father like all haredi women , she dresses very modestly , covers her hair with a wig or scarf and will not allow physical contact of any kind with any man other than her husband .
" being haredi means being someone who fears god , " mrs greenwald says .
" it means that first and foremost in life are the torah -lrb- bible -rrb- and keeping the mitzvoth -lrb- commandments -rrb- . "
she is referring to the 613 commandments in the bible that jews believe were given to them by god .
" everything in my life is built around the torah , " she says .
" if i go on a trip with my family , i ca n't eat just anything , i ca n't go mixed swimming , and i 'm constantly thinking ' what is the proper thing to do now ? '
as haredim we do n't just live , but we live with a purpose . "
that purpose , as she defines it , is to fulfil the torah and mitzvoth by bettering herself as well as the world around her , and in so doing striving to become closer to god .
it is for this reason that she proudly supports her family while her husband pursues his religious studies .
' positive energy ' currently haredim make up about 10 % of israeli society , and have a less than positive reputation among secular israelis , many of whom view their customs as primitive and disapprove of their choice to study at seminaries and thus avoid the mandatory army draft .

mr eliahu , who also earns a meagre wage working at a support centre for haredi youth in the evenings , explains that haredim believe that there must always be a certain amount of men learning the jewish books in order for life , as we know it , to go on .
he is a direct descendant of the hatam sopher , a leading 19th century rabbi of european jewry and one of several key figures who were the early leaders of the various haredi sects .
mr eliahu says israel and the world need the " positive energy " that comes from learning torah .
" this sounds funny to the western ear - what can a man learning in a yeshiva all day possibly give back to the world ? " he says .
" torah learning that we do is the hidden code of the physical existence of all mankind , and if for one single second there is no torah learning in the air , all the world would go back to chaos . "
mr eliahu 's wife , miriam , teaches english at two jerusalem schools and takes care of their children .
" there 's no point to our physical existence without a spiritual purpose , and i , as the husband who is learning all day , am primarily responsible for that , " he explains .

mrs greenwald says being haredi means being someone who fears god sitting on a park bench in the late afternoon , michal greenwald watches her children run around the playground with dozens of other kids as she takes a few minutes rest from her hectic day .
a full-time property lawyer , mrs greenwald is the sole breadwinner and also takes care of her four young children and tends to the housework .
her husband , shmuel , spends his days studying in a religious seminary for men .
she says she can not imagine life any other way .
' ' girls are raised this way from a young age , and such are the lives of haredim in israel , " she says of the ultra-orthodox jews who choose to live separately from mainstream israeli society .
it is difficult to walk the streets of jerusalem without running into haredim , but their community can seem isolated and closed .
the men are distinct in their long black wool coats and trousers , stark white button-down shirts and black hats , even in the heat of the middle eastern summer .
living ' with a purpose ' mrs greenwald , 34 , lives in har nof , an ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of jerusalem where absolutely everything is closed on saturday - the sabbath - and only kosher food is sold in shops .
we look different , in fact we look very weird - we dress how people used to dress 100 years ago moshe eliahu haredi student and father like all haredi women , she dresses very modestly , covers her hair with a wig or scarf and will not allow physical contact of any kind with any man other than her husband .
" being haredi means being someone who fears god , " mrs greenwald says .
" it means that first and foremost in life are the torah -lrb- bible -rrb- and keeping the mitzvoth -lrb- commandments -rrb- . "
she is referring to the 613 commandments in the bible that jews believe were given to them by god .
" everything in my life is built around the torah , " she says .
" if i go on a trip with my family , i ca n't eat just anything , i ca n't go mixed swimming , and i 'm constantly thinking ' what is the proper thing to do now ? '
as haredim we do n't just live , but we live with a purpose . "
that purpose , as she defines it , is to fulfil the torah and mitzvoth by bettering herself as well as the world around her , and in so doing striving to become closer to god .
it is for this reason that she proudly supports her family while her husband pursues his religious studies .
' positive energy ' currently haredim make up about 10 % of israeli society , and have a less than positive reputation among secular israelis , many of whom view their customs as primitive and disapprove of their choice to study at seminaries and thus avoid the mandatory army draft .
" it 's an ancient concept in judaism that the spiritual and the physical are united , that to win a war you need both spirit and strength , " says moshe eliahu , a haredi father of two and full-time student at a jerusalem seminary .
haredi men in black suits and hats are a common sight in jerusalem " you need people fighting , but you also need people learning and praying . "
according to government figures , the majority of haredi men do not have paid jobs .
mr eliahu , who also earns a meagre wage working at a support centre for haredi youth in the evenings , explains that haredim believe that there must always be a certain amount of men learning the jewish books in order for life , as we know it , to go on .
he is a direct descendant of the hatam sopher , a leading 19th century rabbi of european jewry and one of several key figures who were the early leaders of the various haredi sects .
mr eliahu says israel and the world need the " positive energy " that comes from learning torah .
" this sounds funny to the western ear - what can a man learning in a yeshiva all day possibly give back to the world ? " he says .
" torah learning that we do is the hidden code of the physical existence of all mankind , and if for one single second there is no torah learning in the air , all the world would go back to chaos . "
mr eliahu 's wife , miriam , teaches english at two jerusalem schools and takes care of their children .
" there 's no point to our physical existence without a spiritual purpose , and i , as the husband who is learning all day , am primarily responsible for that , " he explains .
' defence mechanism ' he also rejects the view that haredi gender roles are primitive .
in judaism , he says , women are actually considered to be closer to god than men .
' ' they are the ones who create life , they are the queens . "
dressed in classic haredi garb , he acknowledges he stands out on the street .
' ' we look different , in fact we look very weird .
we dress how people used to dress 100 years ago , we have long peyot -lrb- side locks -rrb- , and all these things set us apart . "
he explains that haredi men dress this way as a " defence mechanism " to " protect ourselves from assimilation " .
mrs greenwald too defines herself by her religious ideals , setting herself apart from the values of wider society .
" i do n't live life for myself , " she says .
" my priority is my family , my home , and then my career .
i ca n't say i desire to become a famous lawyer , or to be a millionaire .
" for us , there is a bigger picture here .
we know this world is just a hallway to the real life , to the garden of eden . "

as haredim we do n't just live , but we live with a purpose . "
that purpose , as she defines it , is to fulfil the torah and mitzvoth by bettering herself as well as the world around her , and in so doing striving to become closer to god .
it is for this reason that she proudly supports her family while her husband pursues his religious studies .
' positive energy ' currently haredim make up about 10 % of israeli society , and have a less than positive reputation among secular israelis , many of whom view their customs as primitive and disapprove of their choice to study at seminaries and thus avoid the mandatory army draft .
" it 's an ancient concept in judaism that the spiritual and the physical are united , that to win a war you need both spirit and strength , " says moshe eliahu , a haredi father of two and full-time student at a jerusalem seminary .
haredi men in black suits and hats are a common sight in jerusalem " you need people fighting , but you also need people learning and praying . "
according to government figures , the majority of haredi men do not have paid jobs .
mr eliahu , who also earns a meagre wage working at a support centre for haredi youth in the evenings , explains that haredim believe that there must always be a certain amount of men learning the jewish books in order for life , as we know it , to go on .
he is a direct descendant of the hatam sopher , a leading 19th century rabbi of european jewry and one of several key figures who were the early leaders of the various haredi sects .
mr eliahu says israel and the world need the " positive energy " that comes from learning torah .
" this sounds funny to the western ear - what can a man learning in a yeshiva all day possibly give back to the world ? " he says .
" torah learning that we do is the hidden code of the physical existence of all mankind , and if for one single second there is no torah learning in the air , all the world would go back to chaos . "
mr eliahu 's wife , miriam , teaches english at two jerusalem schools and takes care of their children .
" there 's no point to our physical existence without a spiritual purpose , and i , as the husband who is learning all day , am primarily responsible for that , " he explains .
' defence mechanism ' he also rejects the view that haredi gender roles are primitive .
in judaism , he says , women are actually considered to be closer to god than men .
' ' they are the ones who create life , they are the queens . "
dressed in classic haredi garb , he acknowledges he stands out on the street .
' ' we look different , in fact we look very weird .
we dress how people used to dress 100 years ago , we have long peyot -lrb- side locks -rrb- , and all these things set us apart . "
he explains that haredi men dress this way as a " defence mechanism " to " protect ourselves from assimilation " .
mrs greenwald too defines herself by her religious ideals , setting herself apart from the values of wider society .
" i do n't live life for myself , " she says .
" my priority is my family , my home , and then my career .
i ca n't say i desire to become a famous lawyer , or to be a millionaire .

mrs greenwald says being haredi means being someone who fears god sitting on a park bench in the late afternoon , michal greenwald watches her children run around the playground with dozens of other kids as she takes a few minutes rest from her hectic day .
a full-time property lawyer , mrs greenwald is the sole breadwinner and also takes care of her four young children and tends to the housework .
her husband , shmuel , spends his days studying in a religious seminary for men .
she says she can not imagine life any other way .
' ' girls are raised this way from a young age , and such are the lives of haredim in israel , " she says of the ultra-orthodox jews who choose to live separately from mainstream israeli society .
it is difficult to walk the streets of jerusalem without running into haredim , but their community can seem isolated and closed .
the men are distinct in their long black wool coats and trousers , stark white button-down shirts and black hats , even in the heat of the middle eastern summer .
living ' with a purpose ' mrs greenwald , 34 , lives in har nof , an ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of jerusalem where absolutely everything is closed on saturday - the sabbath - and only kosher food is sold in shops .

she is referring to the 613 commandments in the bible that jews believe were given to them by god .

the money will go on a wide range of schemes , including drainage and culvert work , de-silting and raising banks .
it has come from the county and district councils , with a contribution from the environment agency .
work has already begun on some of the projects , with new bids being submitted for consideration in september .
" i hope this announcement will reassure people in gloucestershire that we and our partners are doing all we can , and as quickly as we can , to protect them from the threat of future flooding , " said councillor julie girling of gloucestershire county council .
" we have assessed schemes on various criteria , including the number of properties in danger of flooding and the likelihood that schemes will start this financial year . "
among the schemes receiving a slice of the £ 2m are projects to de-silt saintbridge balancing pond in gloucester to increase its capacity , and the removal of the sluice gate at bourton-on-the-water .
in cheltenham the prestbury flood risk management scheme , which has an estimated cost of £ 350,000 , will be paid for using the new money , as will a £ 300,000 de-silting programme on the river chelt .
tewkesbury , which was all but cut off by the june and july deluge of 2007 , will benefit from £ 90,000 which is to be spent on a scheme to clear and rebuild the culvert at castle street .

rival brands have accused the firm of psychologically pressurising athletes to wear its latest swimsuit while coaches have attacked speedo for sapping morale .
meanwhile a rival company , california 's tyr sport , has even mounted legal action - taking speedo to the us courts accusing it of false advertising and of conducting a monopoly .
tyr has also sued the us swimming team , its head coach mark schubert and even two-times olympian erik vendt for daring to wear speedo 's latest wonder-suit when he was contracted to slip into tyr 's swimwear .
performance boost behind all the upset is speedo 's lzr swimsuit - a space-age outfit that many believe can significantly improve performance .
already in beijing it has been worn in a string of world record swims , and helped michael phelps to take six gold medals so far .
so it 's no surprise that the outfit has sparked claims of " technological doping " , triggering fierce debates about performance on the poolside .
some athletes are so convinced of its positive effects on performance that they have ditched sponsorship agreements with rival firms to get hold of it .
phelps ' beijing gold record 400m individual medley -lrb- world record -rrb- 4x100m freestyle relay -lrb- wr -rrb- 200m freestyle -lrb- wr -rrb- 200m butterfly -lrb- wr -rrb- 4x200m freestyle -lrb- wr -rrb- 200m individual medley -lrb- wr -rrb- 100m butterfly 4x100m relay -lrb- wr -rrb- kosuke kitajima forced japan 's national team to drop its contract with mizuno 8022 and two other firms and allow its swimmers to use the lzr .
meanwhile , italy 's national squad - which is sponsored by arena - has said it will allow its swimmers to wear other brands , as long as they pay a fine .
but germany has been forced to keep its links with adidas , refusing appeals for its athletes to don the lzr .
" there have been 39 world records , long and short course , this year and 90 % of them were in speedo , " team coach orjan madsen told reuters in may .
" that , of course , does something to the athletes .
it 's almost impossible to put yourself in a state of mind where you say it does n't matter .
of course it matters . "
three years in the making at the group 's mystery-laden aqualab , and aided by nasa , the next-generation swimsuit sounds - and looks - like something superheroes would wear .
its corset-like design holds the wearer 's body in the optimum position , says speedo .
the firm claims that the water-repellent fabric and laser bonded seams cut drag while the overall design is intended to improve oxygen intake by as much as 5 % .
all of this led the us swimming team 's coach to declare the suits could improve performance by 2 % - a vital measure in a sport where hundredths of a second can mean a new world record , or the difference between a gold medal and leaving empty-handed .
' psychological pressure ' mr schubert believed in the suit so much he warned swimmers taking part in olympic trials earlier this year that they should wear the lzr " or they may end up at home watching on nbc " .
speedo 's dominance of the pool has sparked anger among its rivals sportswear manufacturer arena has withdrawn from the battleground .
but not without first firing some very public warning shots at speedo accusing it of putting athletes under clearly " enormous psychological pressure " .
in a recent statement arena said the new generation of swimsuits had " clearly produced an atmosphere of anxiety , confusion and uncertainty that has been amplified and hyped by the media throughout the world " .
but it said it had decided to " avoid any further , and probably fruitless , legal action " and instead would now dedicate its time to developing new and improved performance swimwear .
but perhaps arena 's decision was also prompted by the fact that the sport 's governing authority - fina - gave its blessing to the lzr after arena demanded that it investigate whether the swimsuit gave an unfair benefit to the athletes who wore it .
level playing field ?
the furore surrounding the lzr even forced fina to ensure the olympics would not be a battle of haves against have-nots - particularly when the lzr has a price tag of $ 550 -lrb- £ 294 -rrb- - by allowing all of the major manufacturers to hand out suits to national teams .
" it will be fair because we have a rule that says the swimsuits should be available for all the swimmers .
so everybody can have access to the swimsuits they want , " fina chief cornel marculescu said .
but speedo has clearly won the battle of beijing with more than 90 % of the swimmers donning its futuristic lzr costume .
acres of coverage have also benefited the brand - in particular the performance of us swimmer michael phelps and his mission to grab a record-breaking eight golds at the games .
value for money joyce julius & associates , a us firm which measures sponsorship values , has estimated that the airtime phelps has grabbed on american tv channel nbc alone is worth $ 3.6m to speedo .
the halo effect on the brand and the rest of its swimwear is going to be massive rune gustafson , interbrand " truly , we 've been able to leverage his popularity with all of our accounts because he has transcended swimming , " said stu isaac , senior vice president for marketing and sales for speedo .
" it 's helping speedo become cooler and addressing a younger market outside just that core competitive swimmer . "
speedo international 's co-president andy long says the group now plans to capitalise on its olympic coverage , using it to push into new beach and leisure wear markets in newer markets like china .
" in the run-up to the olympics we focused on the elite suits , now we 'll be using that olympic recognition around the world to continue the link . "
indeed , the firm says its showing at the olympics has sparked huge interest in its lzr suits - which wo n't be available to the general public until later this year .
" it 's a gold medal for branding for speedo at this olympics , " says jasmine montgomery of the consultants futurebrand .
" the glamour of beautiful athletes doing incredibly well is gold for speedo , you could n't put a price on the publicity it 's getting . "
' halo effect ' in coming months the group also plans to capitalise on its popularity , and broaden its appeal from traditional swimwear to a fashion brand - a move that will see it following in the footsteps of adidas and nike .
" the halo effect on the brand and the rest of its swimwear is going to be massive , " says rune gustafson , chief executive on international branding consultancy interbrand .
speedo is reaping the rewards of signing up record-breaker phelps " the strongest form of advertising is performance and word of mouth and this is what it 's all about . "
and michael phelps ' record-breaking performance will have do none harm , providing free advertising worth more than " tens of millions " , mr gustafson adds .
at present , competition swimwear makes up 60 % of its sales - but the group has branched out into beach fitness and leisure gear .
with the global swimwear market estimated to be worth $ 13.3bn -lrb- £ 6.6bn -rrb- , speedo 's coverage at the beijing olympics could deliver significant gains .
but speedo wo n't be the only winners .
if phelps continues his record-breaking streak his performance could pay dividends as the manufacturer has promised him a $ 1m payout should he win seven golds or more .
but as speedo 's mr long says , it 's a cheque the group will be " delighted " to sign .

rival brands have accused the firm of psychologically pressurising athletes to wear its latest swimsuit while coaches have attacked speedo for sapping morale .
meanwhile a rival company , california 's tyr sport , has even mounted legal action - taking speedo to the us courts accusing it of false advertising and of conducting a monopoly .
tyr has also sued the us swimming team , its head coach mark schubert and even two-times olympian erik vendt for daring to wear speedo 's latest wonder-suit when he was contracted to slip into tyr 's swimwear .
performance boost behind all the upset is speedo 's lzr swimsuit - a space-age outfit that many believe can significantly improve performance .
already in beijing it has been worn in a string of world record swims , and helped michael phelps to take six gold medals so far .
so it 's no surprise that the outfit has sparked claims of " technological doping " , triggering fierce debates about performance on the poolside .
some athletes are so convinced of its positive effects on performance that they have ditched sponsorship agreements with rival firms to get hold of it .
phelps ' beijing gold record 400m individual medley -lrb- world record -rrb- 4x100m freestyle relay -lrb- wr -rrb- 200m freestyle -lrb- wr -rrb- 200m butterfly -lrb- wr -rrb- 4x200m freestyle -lrb- wr -rrb- 200m individual medley -lrb- wr -rrb- 100m butterfly 4x100m relay -lrb- wr -rrb- kosuke kitajima forced japan 's national team to drop its contract with mizuno 8022 and two other firms and allow its swimmers to use the lzr .
meanwhile , italy 's national squad - which is sponsored by arena - has said it will allow its swimmers to wear other brands , as long as they pay a fine .
but germany has been forced to keep its links with adidas , refusing appeals for its athletes to don the lzr .
" there have been 39 world records , long and short course , this year and 90 % of them were in speedo , " team coach orjan madsen told reuters in may .
" that , of course , does something to the athletes .
it 's almost impossible to put yourself in a state of mind where you say it does n't matter .
of course it matters . "
three years in the making at the group 's mystery-laden aqualab , and aided by nasa , the next-generation swimsuit sounds - and looks - like something superheroes would wear .
its corset-like design holds the wearer 's body in the optimum position , says speedo .
the firm claims that the water-repellent fabric and laser bonded seams cut drag while the overall design is intended to improve oxygen intake by as much as 5 % .
all of this led the us swimming team 's coach to declare the suits could improve performance by 2 % - a vital measure in a sport where hundredths of a second can mean a new world record , or the difference between a gold medal and leaving empty-handed .
' psychological pressure ' mr schubert believed in the suit so much he warned swimmers taking part in olympic trials earlier this year that they should wear the lzr " or they may end up at home watching on nbc " .
speedo 's dominance of the pool has sparked anger among its rivals sportswear manufacturer arena has withdrawn from the battleground .
but not without first firing some very public warning shots at speedo accusing it of putting athletes under clearly " enormous psychological pressure " .
in a recent statement arena said the new generation of swimsuits had " clearly produced an atmosphere of anxiety , confusion and uncertainty that has been amplified and hyped by the media throughout the world " .
but it said it had decided to " avoid any further , and probably fruitless , legal action " and instead would now dedicate its time to developing new and improved performance swimwear .
but perhaps arena 's decision was also prompted by the fact that the sport 's governing authority - fina - gave its blessing to the lzr after arena demanded that it investigate whether the swimsuit gave an unfair benefit to the athletes who wore it .
level playing field ?
the furore surrounding the lzr even forced fina to ensure the olympics would not be a battle of haves against have-nots - particularly when the lzr has a price tag of $ 550 -lrb- £ 294 -rrb- - by allowing all of the major manufacturers to hand out suits to national teams .
" it will be fair because we have a rule that says the swimsuits should be available for all the swimmers .
so everybody can have access to the swimsuits they want , " fina chief cornel marculescu said .
but speedo has clearly won the battle of beijing with more than 90 % of the swimmers donning its futuristic lzr costume .
acres of coverage have also benefited the brand - in particular the performance of us swimmer michael phelps and his mission to grab a record-breaking eight golds at the games .
value for money joyce julius & associates , a us firm which measures sponsorship values , has estimated that the airtime phelps has grabbed on american tv channel nbc alone is worth $ 3.6m to speedo .
the halo effect on the brand and the rest of its swimwear is going to be massive rune gustafson , interbrand " truly , we 've been able to leverage his popularity with all of our accounts because he has transcended swimming , " said stu isaac , senior vice president for marketing and sales for speedo .
" it 's helping speedo become cooler and addressing a younger market outside just that core competitive swimmer . "
speedo international 's co-president andy long says the group now plans to capitalise on its olympic coverage , using it to push into new beach and leisure wear markets in newer markets like china .
" in the run-up to the olympics we focused on the elite suits , now we 'll be using that olympic recognition around the world to continue the link . "
indeed , the firm says its showing at the olympics has sparked huge interest in its lzr suits - which wo n't be available to the general public until later this year .
" it 's a gold medal for branding for speedo at this olympics , " says jasmine montgomery of the consultants futurebrand .
" the glamour of beautiful athletes doing incredibly well is gold for speedo , you could n't put a price on the publicity it 's getting . "
' halo effect ' in coming months the group also plans to capitalise on its popularity , and broaden its appeal from traditional swimwear to a fashion brand - a move that will see it following in the footsteps of adidas and nike .
" the halo effect on the brand and the rest of its swimwear is going to be massive , " says rune gustafson , chief executive on international branding consultancy interbrand .
speedo is reaping the rewards of signing up record-breaker phelps " the strongest form of advertising is performance and word of mouth and this is what it 's all about . "
and michael phelps ' record-breaking performance will have do none harm , providing free advertising worth more than " tens of millions " , mr gustafson adds .
at present , competition swimwear makes up 60 % of its sales - but the group has branched out into beach fitness and leisure gear .
with the global swimwear market estimated to be worth $ 13.3bn -lrb- £ 6.6bn -rrb- , speedo 's coverage at the beijing olympics could deliver significant gains .
but speedo wo n't be the only winners .
if phelps continues his record-breaking streak his performance could pay dividends as the manufacturer has promised him a $ 1m payout should he win seven golds or more .
but as speedo 's mr long says , it 's a cheque the group will be " delighted " to sign .

frank bainimarama , who seized power in a bloodless coup in december 2006 , says fiji is being pressured to return to democratic rule too quickly .
but new zealand prime minister helen clark said she suspected he was " looking for an excuse " .
soaring fuel and food prices are also on the agenda of the 16-nation summit .
they have hit pacific islands particularly hard due to their reliance on imported foods , physical isolation and weak economies .
bitter divisions mr bainimarama gave a commitment at last year 's pacific islands forum in tonga to hold democratic elections in fiji by march 2009 .
but he now says that the elections will be delayed for up to 15 months to allow a new electoral system to be set up .
he says this is necessary to try to overcome some of the deep divisions that remain in fiji between the majority indigenous population and fijians of indian background .
mr bainimarama , who accuses australia and new zealand of driving opposition to his regime , also blamed his absence on new zealand 's refusal to give his delegation visas to attend post-forum talks in auckland .
but ms clark rejected his arguments when she spoke to reporters in wellington .
" if that 's what he 's saying , then i suspect that he was looking for an excuse , " she said .
" i think it speaks volumes if they are not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders . "
australia 's foreign minister stephen smith told australian television it was " very disappointing that he wo n't turn up to effectively take his medicine " .
' durable democracy ' delegates at the summit , which runs from tuesday to thursday , are due to hear a report on fiji from a mission of member-nation foreign ministers .
reports say the mission has concluded that political will is the only obstacle to holding elections in fiji by march .
but in a statement sent to forum member states , mr bainimarama said his government needed time to reform a " racist , divisive , undemocratic and unfair electoral system " .
he said he wanted the forum to support the reform process , but if it did not " i will be compelled ... to tell the people of my country that they must now be prepared to suffer more sanctions , and international isolation as we pursue ... a better , more durable democracy " .
mr bainimarama has governed fiji since ousting elected prime minister laisenia qarase in december 2006 , accusing him of corruption .
fiji has endured four coups and a military mutiny since 1987 .

" the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively . "
he accused the milf leadership of having no control over local commanders .
" if they ca n't control them , the government will certainly control them , " he said .
troops are now searching for the rebels , who are thought to have escaped into nearby forest areas .
a night-time curfew has been imposed in iligan , the provincial capital of lanao del norte .
more than 100,000 people have been killed in almost four decades of separatist fighting in the south .

the supreme court is scheduled to hold another hearing on the agreement on 22 august .

hundreds of muslim rebels attacked towns in lanao del norte on monday , looting shops and burning houses .
a spokesman for the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- said a renegade commander was to blame for the attacks .
the violence came after the supreme court blocked a land deal aimed at ending years of fighting in the south .
the government had agreed to expand an existing muslim autonomous zone on mindanao island .
but the court suspended the deal earlier this month after christian communities argued it would increase sectarian divisions .
two weeks ago rebels occupied villages in north cotabato province .
the military used air strikes and artillery assaults to force them back and casualties were reported on both sides .
' act decisively ' monday 's raids in lanao del norte province took place near the border of the existing autonomous zone .
in pre-dawn attacks , rebels attacked at least two towns and some outlying villages .
troops and police fought fierce battles with the rebels in the mostly christian towns of kolambugan and kauswagan .
about 30 civilians and troops were killed and some residents were taken hostage by the retreating guerrillas , reports said .
several thousand people fled the fighting .
philippine military chief gen alexander yano said troops would chase down the rebels .
" you all know we have bent as far backward -lsb- as possible -rsb- to give peace a chance , " he told local radio .
" the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively . "
