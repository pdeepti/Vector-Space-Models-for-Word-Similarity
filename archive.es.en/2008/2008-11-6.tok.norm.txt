but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .
bush 's opposition to committing his country to clear targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions unless other major polluters such as china and india do the same is seen by many europeans as one of the main obstacles to saving the planet . and obama 's frequent remarks that protecting the environment should be seen as an opportunity , rather than a challenge , have sounded like sweet music in many european ears . " he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change . " and change is what we need in the world today , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .

late last week , ukraine 's parliament approved legislation clearing the way for the imf loan and establishing a stabilization fund to help ailing banks and companies unable to service their foreign debts due to the worldwide financial crisis .
guarantees for bank deposits will be increased so as to bolster confidence in the banking system , and the government will be able to take a stake in lenders if necessary .

his efforts came just months after he was refused permission to live in england with his british wife . the spanish interior ministry has rejected a request for political asylum by omar bin laden , one of the 19 children of al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , media reported thursday , nov .
6 . the 27-year-old son of osama bin laden had argued that he did not feel safe in any arab country . spain based its rejection partly on a report by the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , interior ministry sources were quoted as saying . bin laden can appeal the decision , following which spain would reconsider his case within two days .
if the ministry then made another negative decision and the unhcr issued another unfavorable report , bin laden would be expelled immediately . omar bin laden , who has publicly urged his father to abandon terrorism , was being held at madrid airport .
he arrived on flight from cairo to casablanca , which made a stopover in madrid on monday . in april , britain denied a visa to bin laden , who is married to a british citizen . dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .
" i think it 's now time to really start negotiating . " eu foreign ministers will be meeting on nov .
10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .
14 . one day later , medvedev and obama could have the opportunity to begin sorting out their differences .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said the two politicians may meet on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .
bush 's opposition to committing his country to clear targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions unless other major polluters such as china and india do the same is seen by many europeans as one of the main obstacles to saving the planet . and obama 's frequent remarks that protecting the environment should be seen as an opportunity , rather than a challenge , have sounded like sweet music in many european ears . " he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change .

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .
in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu .
-lrb- 05.10.2008 -rrb- new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas the eu 's decision to lower expections for biofuel use could be of some concern to leading producers such as brazil .
but the new technologies the eu is considering may actually be more profitable than current biofuels .

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .

the ecb has now slashed rates by 100 basis points in just four weeks , while the boe has trimmed rates by 250 basis points in a month . analysts expect both banks to follow up thursday 's cuts with more reductions in borrowing costs in the coming months and predict that rates could be as low as 2 percent by the middle of next year . the global drive to lower rates also forms part of the build-up to a meeting of european union leaders in brussels friday and a larger gathering of the group of 20 government chiefs in washington in a week to discuss measures for dealing with the global financial crisis . world-wide cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england 's cuts have been more aggressive indeed , this week 's ecb and boe reductions also come in the wake of new wave of rate cuts around the world lead by the us federal reserve and the bank of japan . the monetary authorities in norway , slovakia , the czech republic , south korea , taiwan , israel and china have also reduced the cost of money in the run-up to thursday 's boe 's nine-member monetary committee meeting in london and the ecb 's 21-head governing council gathering in frankfurt . on tuesday , australia 's reserve bank delivered its third rate cut in as many months slashing rates by a hefty 75 basis points . more to the point , the gloomy global economic outlook and falling inflation is giving central banks around the world room to move on borrowing costs . eurozone inflation slipped to 3.2 percent in october from 3.6 percent in september on falling oil prices .
preliminary data released last week showed business confidence in the currency bloc plunging to a 15-year low . the eurozone economy is expected to grow by a feeble 0.1 percent next year , the european commission said in its latest projections released monday inflation would sink to 2.2 per cent next year . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .
financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has been pushing his country towards the west the two-year agreement with imf allows the eastern european country to receive 3.5 billion euros immediately in exchange for agreeing to a series of financial reforms .

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.11.2008 medvedev challenges us , hopes obama means change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev blamed the us for the georgian war and the financial crisis russian president dmitry medvedev nominally said he hoped for improved ties with the new us president , but also that russia would fight us missile defense plans by deploying missiles near poland . in his first state-of-the-nation speech since taking office in may , medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 06.11.2008 bayern munich close in on champions ' league second round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an important point for coach klinsmann and bayern , but another unconvincing display .
a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .
bush 's opposition to committing his country to clear targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions unless other major polluters such as china and india do the same is seen by many europeans as one of the main obstacles to saving the planet . and obama 's frequent remarks that protecting the environment should be seen as an opportunity , rather than a challenge , have sounded like sweet music in many european ears . " he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change .

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .
in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”

then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .

and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .
" i think it 's now time to really start negotiating . " eu foreign ministers will be meeting on nov .
10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .
14 . one day later , medvedev and obama could have the opportunity to begin sorting out their differences .

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .

guarantees for bank deposits will be increased so as to bolster confidence in the banking system , and the government will be able to take a stake in lenders if necessary .

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .

in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .
in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty .

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .
bush 's opposition to committing his country to clear targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions unless other major polluters such as china and india do the same is seen by many europeans as one of the main obstacles to saving the planet . and obama 's frequent remarks that protecting the environment should be seen as an opportunity , rather than a challenge , have sounded like sweet music in many european ears . " he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .
bush 's opposition to committing his country to clear targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions unless other major polluters such as china and india do the same is seen by many europeans as one of the main obstacles to saving the planet . and obama 's frequent remarks that protecting the environment should be seen as an opportunity , rather than a challenge , have sounded like sweet music in many european ears . " he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change .

in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty . " a major conference is set to be held in the danish capital of copenhagen in 2009 to decide what will replace the kyoto framework , which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .

medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said .

discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .

10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 06.11.2008 drugs consumption in europe stable , report states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of drugs such as ecstasy has declined in some areas of europe drugs consumption in europe is generally stable or falling , but record opium production in afghanistan may lead to a surge in the availability of heroin across the continent , the eu 's drugs monitoring agency said . " overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .
" we can not ignore the threat posed by the glut of heroin now available on the world market , " goetz said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .
" i think it 's now time to really start negotiating . " eu foreign ministers will be meeting on nov .
10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .
14 . one day later , medvedev and obama could have the opportunity to begin sorting out their differences .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 06.11.2008 bayern munich close in on champions ' league second round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an important point for coach klinsmann and bayern , but another unconvincing display .
a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .
bayern may be on a winning run now , but the defending german champions and bundesliga favorites are still four points adrift of league leaders hoffenheim in the league .
with a key league match coming up on sunday nov .

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .

10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .
14 . one day later , medvedev and obama could have the opportunity to begin sorting out their differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .

late last week , ukraine 's parliament approved legislation clearing the way for the imf loan and establishing a stabilization fund to help ailing banks and companies unable to service their foreign debts due to the worldwide financial crisis .
guarantees for bank deposits will be increased so as to bolster confidence in the banking system , and the government will be able to take a stake in lenders if necessary .

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .
" they would rather have the job and pay a little bit more for a t-shirt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's stance on climate change is more euro-friendly than bush 's another major issue on the global agenda is the fight against climate change .
bush 's opposition to committing his country to clear targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions unless other major polluters such as china and india do the same is seen by many europeans as one of the main obstacles to saving the planet . and obama 's frequent remarks that protecting the environment should be seen as an opportunity , rather than a challenge , have sounded like sweet music in many european ears . " he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change .

his efforts came just months after he was refused permission to live in england with his british wife . the spanish interior ministry has rejected a request for political asylum by omar bin laden , one of the 19 children of al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , media reported thursday , nov .

if the ministry then made another negative decision and the unhcr issued another unfavorable report , bin laden would be expelled immediately . omar bin laden , who has publicly urged his father to abandon terrorism , was being held at madrid airport .
he arrived on flight from cairo to casablanca , which made a stopover in madrid on monday . in april , britain denied a visa to bin laden , who is married to a british citizen . dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 05.10.2008 -rrb- new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas the eu 's decision to lower expections for biofuel use could be of some concern to leading producers such as brazil .
but the new technologies the eu is considering may actually be more profitable than current biofuels .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu .

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .

guarantees for bank deposits will be increased so as to bolster confidence in the banking system , and the government will be able to take a stake in lenders if necessary .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his efforts came just months after he was refused permission to live in england with his british wife . the spanish interior ministry has rejected a request for political asylum by omar bin laden , one of the 19 children of al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , media reported thursday , nov .
6 . the 27-year-old son of osama bin laden had argued that he did not feel safe in any arab country . spain based its rejection partly on a report by the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , interior ministry sources were quoted as saying . bin laden can appeal the decision , following which spain would reconsider his case within two days .
if the ministry then made another negative decision and the unhcr issued another unfavorable report , bin laden would be expelled immediately . omar bin laden , who has publicly urged his father to abandon terrorism , was being held at madrid airport .
he arrived on flight from cairo to casablanca , which made a stopover in madrid on monday . in april , britain denied a visa to bin laden , who is married to a british citizen . dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 06.11.2008 drugs consumption in europe stable , report states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of drugs such as ecstasy has declined in some areas of europe drugs consumption in europe is generally stable or falling , but record opium production in afghanistan may lead to a surge in the availability of heroin across the continent , the eu 's drugs monitoring agency said . " overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .
" we can not ignore the threat posed by the glut of heroin now available on the world market , " goetz said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .

late last week , ukraine 's parliament approved legislation clearing the way for the imf loan and establishing a stabilization fund to help ailing banks and companies unable to service their foreign debts due to the worldwide financial crisis .
guarantees for bank deposits will be increased so as to bolster confidence in the banking system , and the government will be able to take a stake in lenders if necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 06.11.2008 drugs consumption in europe stable , report states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of drugs such as ecstasy has declined in some areas of europe drugs consumption in europe is generally stable or falling , but record opium production in afghanistan may lead to a surge in the availability of heroin across the continent , the eu 's drugs monitoring agency said . " overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .

" " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty . " a major conference is set to be held in the danish capital of copenhagen in 2009 to decide what will replace the kyoto framework , which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .
" we can not ignore the threat posed by the glut of heroin now available on the world market , " goetz said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he will influence how china and developing countries reason about climate issues , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . russia on front burner for many europeans , the main challenge of the united states and european union will be its handling of an increasingly belligerent russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both us candidates wanted to take a tough line with russian president dmitry medvedev while people like lithuanian president valdas adamkus hope that obama 's " strong stand in the face of russia 's aggression against georgia " will help countries like his feel better protected , diplomatic doves like germany hope the democrat 's multilateralism will help restore relations with the eu 's most powerful neighbor . though his willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with rogue states like iran is likely to resonate positively in berlin , obama 's call for a stronger european role in nato 's fight against afghanistan 's taliban will cause unease in many european capitals . eu hopes for change obama 's election is unequivocal good news for those eu countries for whom the defense of human rights represents a top priority . commenting on the victory , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said obama 's election should increase the chances that the us join the international criminal court in the hague and close down the internationally controversial us prison on guantanamo bay on cuba . as javier solana , the eu 's top diplomat , put it , obama achieved a " fantastic victory " based on the promise of change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 06.11.2008 bayern munich close in on champions ' league second round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an important point for coach klinsmann and bayern , but another unconvincing display .
a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .
bayern may be on a winning run now , but the defending german champions and bundesliga favorites are still four points adrift of league leaders hoffenheim in the league .
with a key league match coming up on sunday nov .
9 against rivals schalke – who are currently fourth in the league just one point behind bayern – klinsmann 's men will probably be glad that reaching the final stages of the champions ' league is now looking like a formality . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .
bayern may be on a winning run now , but the defending german champions and bundesliga favorites are still four points adrift of league leaders hoffenheim in the league .
with a key league match coming up on sunday nov .
9 against rivals schalke – who are currently fourth in the league just one point behind bayern – klinsmann 's men will probably be glad that reaching the final stages of the champions ' league is now looking like a formality . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .

while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .

carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .
" i think it 's now time to really start negotiating . " eu foreign ministers will be meeting on nov .
10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .
14 . one day later , medvedev and obama could have the opportunity to begin sorting out their differences .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said the two politicians may meet on nov .

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .
bayern may be on a winning run now , but the defending german champions and bundesliga favorites are still four points adrift of league leaders hoffenheim in the league .

the ecb has now slashed rates by 100 basis points in just four weeks , while the boe has trimmed rates by 250 basis points in a month . analysts expect both banks to follow up thursday 's cuts with more reductions in borrowing costs in the coming months and predict that rates could be as low as 2 percent by the middle of next year . the global drive to lower rates also forms part of the build-up to a meeting of european union leaders in brussels friday and a larger gathering of the group of 20 government chiefs in washington in a week to discuss measures for dealing with the global financial crisis . world-wide cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england 's cuts have been more aggressive indeed , this week 's ecb and boe reductions also come in the wake of new wave of rate cuts around the world lead by the us federal reserve and the bank of japan . the monetary authorities in norway , slovakia , the czech republic , south korea , taiwan , israel and china have also reduced the cost of money in the run-up to thursday 's boe 's nine-member monetary committee meeting in london and the ecb 's 21-head governing council gathering in frankfurt . on tuesday , australia 's reserve bank delivered its third rate cut in as many months slashing rates by a hefty 75 basis points . more to the point , the gloomy global economic outlook and falling inflation is giving central banks around the world room to move on borrowing costs . eurozone inflation slipped to 3.2 percent in october from 3.6 percent in september on falling oil prices .
preliminary data released last week showed business confidence in the currency bloc plunging to a 15-year low . the eurozone economy is expected to grow by a feeble 0.1 percent next year , the european commission said in its latest projections released monday inflation would sink to 2.2 per cent next year . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu .
-lrb- 05.10.2008 -rrb- new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas the eu 's decision to lower expections for biofuel use could be of some concern to leading producers such as brazil .
but the new technologies the eu is considering may actually be more profitable than current biofuels .

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .
in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty . " a major conference is set to be held in the danish capital of copenhagen in 2009 to decide what will replace the kyoto framework , which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu .

but the new technologies the eu is considering may actually be more profitable than current biofuels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.11.2008 opinion : bad timing and worse talk from russia 's medvedev großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev gave a speech to the nation shortly after the historic victory of barack obama in the us presidential election .
it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they admit there is much room for improvement . under outgoing us president george w. bush , defeat in tackling some of the world 's most pressing problems was often blamed on a lack of trans-atlantic cooperation . " i sincerely hope that with the leadership of president obama , the us will join forces with europe , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , adding that , together , the us and eu could work " for the benefit of our societies -lrb- and -rrb- the world . " the most immediate crisis facing the world is the global credit crunch , which originated in the us , and which many europeans blame squarely on excessive deregulation in the us markets . " while the financial crisis and its economic fall-outs come primarily from the absence or lack of regulation of us markets , our duty is to work hand in hand with the united states , " said joseph daul , who chairs the conservative grouping in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , not obama , will be heading the first major financial reform summit in washington the leaders of britain , france , germany and italy will travel to washington on nov .
15 for the first in a series of international summits aimed at reforming the way global finance is run . while obama will not be in charge until january , europeans like french president nicolas sarkozy , who believe capitalism should be constrained and corporate salaries curbed , might find a sympathetic ear in the future democratic leadership . but when it comes to finding remedies to the global economic slowdown , trans-atlantic teamwork could well break down . free trade at risk ? the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , believes that free trade is the best way to promote global prosperity .
but judging from some of the comments he made on the campaign trail , there is a concrete risk that obama 's protectionist instincts may stand in the way of a deal . " look , people do n't want a cheaper t-shirt if they 're losing a job in the process , " obama said in august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians are urging russia and the us to enter into a constructive dialog . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized russia 's plans to deploy missiles in kaliningrad .
he told german television it was " the wrong signal at the wrong time . " steinmeier called on russia to enter into dialogue with the united states on the issue .
he said he hoped moscow would recognize the election of barack obama as an opportunity for a new beginning .
at the same time , he warned of a new spiral of rearmament in europe . russia 's president dmitry medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 announced plans to position short-range missiles in the western russian territory of kaliningrad , located on the eu 's eastern border between lithuania and poland .
medvedev justified the move as a reaction to us plans to set up a missile defense shield in poland . russia is a required partner " russia is not an easy partner , " steinmeier said .
but without russia , international crises such as afghanistan , iran , the middle east or caucasus could not be solved , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense system will entail short-range missiles karsten voigt , the coordinator of german-american cooperation in the german foreign office , called medvedev 's plans " negative and destructive " and said the issue showed the importance of disarmament dialogue with russia . " you have to talk with russia , because you need russia in order to curtail iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " voigt said in an interview with news agency ap . nato meanwhile voiced " serious worries " about the compatibility of russia 's plans with arms control arrangements , alliance spokesman robert pszczel said . " moreover , placing these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " pszczel told afp news agency . eu seeks united voice towards russia the european commission urged member states to agree to resume eu-russia partnership talks in its review of eu-russia relations issued on wednesday .
discussions between the two sides were suspended in september following the russia-georgia conflict . however , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the talks " are not a gift to russia . " " we have a deep and complex relationship where our mutual interests are deeply entwined , " ferrero-waldner told the eu parliament 's foreign affairs committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caucasus conflict has severely strained russian-eu ties " this does not mean business as usual because we can not accept the status quo in georgia , " she said .
" i think it 's now time to really start negotiating . " eu foreign ministers will be meeting on nov .
10 .
it would be an opportunity for member states to find a common basis for the negotiations to proceed , the review said . " when the eu speaks with one voice , and acts as one , russia takes notice , " it said . ferrero-waldner criticized russia 's missile deployment plans . " if you are going to put missiles in kaliningrad that is not going to increase security in europe , " ferrero-waldner told the eu lawmakers .
" i wonder how such steps are compatible with the new european security strategy that russia wants . " the eu foreign ministers meeting will take place just days ahead of an eu-russia summit in nice , france on nov .
14 . one day later , medvedev and obama could have the opportunity to begin sorting out their differences .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said the two politicians may meet on nov .

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .

obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 06.11.2008 biofuel producers call proposed eu regulations unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' flower power ' is no longer just a hippie fantasy .
but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu , brazil at odds over biofuel cooperation , says official dw-world.de talked to ricardo dorneles , the secretary for biofuels in brazil 's ministry for mines and energy , about his country 's biofuels industry and brazil 's relationship with the eu .
-lrb- 05.10.2008 -rrb- new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas the eu 's decision to lower expections for biofuel use could be of some concern to leading producers such as brazil .
but the new technologies the eu is considering may actually be more profitable than current biofuels .

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .
" we can not ignore the threat posed by the glut of heroin now available on the world market , " goetz said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ecb has now slashed rates by 100 basis points in just four weeks , while the boe has trimmed rates by 250 basis points in a month . analysts expect both banks to follow up thursday 's cuts with more reductions in borrowing costs in the coming months and predict that rates could be as low as 2 percent by the middle of next year . the global drive to lower rates also forms part of the build-up to a meeting of european union leaders in brussels friday and a larger gathering of the group of 20 government chiefs in washington in a week to discuss measures for dealing with the global financial crisis . world-wide cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england 's cuts have been more aggressive indeed , this week 's ecb and boe reductions also come in the wake of new wave of rate cuts around the world lead by the us federal reserve and the bank of japan . the monetary authorities in norway , slovakia , the czech republic , south korea , taiwan , israel and china have also reduced the cost of money in the run-up to thursday 's boe 's nine-member monetary committee meeting in london and the ecb 's 21-head governing council gathering in frankfurt . on tuesday , australia 's reserve bank delivered its third rate cut in as many months slashing rates by a hefty 75 basis points . more to the point , the gloomy global economic outlook and falling inflation is giving central banks around the world room to move on borrowing costs . eurozone inflation slipped to 3.2 percent in october from 3.6 percent in september on falling oil prices .
preliminary data released last week showed business confidence in the currency bloc plunging to a 15-year low . the eurozone economy is expected to grow by a feeble 0.1 percent next year , the european commission said in its latest projections released monday inflation would sink to 2.2 per cent next year . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 06.11.2008 bayern munich close in on champions ' league second round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an important point for coach klinsmann and bayern , but another unconvincing display .
a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .
bayern may be on a winning run now , but the defending german champions and bundesliga favorites are still four points adrift of league leaders hoffenheim in the league .
with a key league match coming up on sunday nov .
9 against rivals schalke – who are currently fourth in the league just one point behind bayern – klinsmann 's men will probably be glad that reaching the final stages of the champions ' league is now looking like a formality . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.11.2008 german coalition under fire for backing online investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering their history , germans are wary of state surveillance and breaches of privacy in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .
parliament will vote on the proposal next thursday .
if approved , the law could come into effect by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

the imf has pledged a massive loan . the international monetary fund has approved a 12.8 billion-euro -lrb- $ 16.4-billion -rrb- loan for ukraine to stabilize the nation 's economy , which is being pummeled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
imf deputy managing director and acting chairman murilo portugal said in a statement wednesday that the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress .
“ falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , ” he added .
the banking sector has been hit hard due to its increased exposure to foreign loans since the orange revolution protests of 2004 brought to power a pro-western leadership and economic reformers pressed for more european integration .
some banks have reportedly frozen customers ' accounts while untold numbers of ukrainians have rushed to withdraw their cash , fearing the worst as job losses spread .

late last week , ukraine 's parliament approved legislation clearing the way for the imf loan and establishing a stabilization fund to help ailing banks and companies unable to service their foreign debts due to the worldwide financial crisis .
guarantees for bank deposits will be increased so as to bolster confidence in the banking system , and the government will be able to take a stake in lenders if necessary .

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution . germany 's grand coalition government has reached an agreement on the finer details of the so-called bka -lrb- or " federal criminal police office " -rrb- law .
it will allow german security services to monitor suspected civilians more closely , without people knowing that they 're being watched .
significantly , it also gives the federal criminal police for the first time the right to act preventatively , foiling crimes before they happen .
online espionage has been one of the biggest sticking points during debates in berlin .
under the new proposal investigations can still monitor online activities secretly using so-called trojan software , but only if a judge deems that there is good reason to do so .
however , online evidence can not be used in court if someone 's private life were unduly invaded to obtain it .
a specially designated data protection agent is to be called in for sensitive cases .
in a compromise with the social democrats , this part of the law will only be introduced temporarily .
it is to expire in 2020 , but be critically re-examined after five years . a delicate balance berlin has been divided on this issue for months , seeking a balance between an effective crime-fighting law , and one which protects people 's right to privacy , which is guaranteed by the german constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition says the law is unconstitutional " these were tough talks , but they were well worth it , " said the deputy chairman of the center-right cdu-csu alliance , wolfgang bosbach in an interview with news agency ap .
" we have raised the legal hurdles for some forms of personal investigation , but this is still a law for the real world , and the federal criminal police office will be able to use it to fight terror effectively . "
the proposed law allows german investigators additional methods of clandestine observation on their suspects : video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties - all without the observed citizen 's knowledge or permission .
a breach of the constitution ?
however , while the ruling parties may have reached agreement after months of bickering , they are still unlikely to get approval from opposition parties .
" legally , this is a completely unacceptable result , which the free democrats will reject in parliament , ” said free democrat deputy chairperson sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger .
in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , schnarrenberger said that online searches take so long to complete that urgent cases which would yield results are impossible to imagine .
" it is essential that online investigations are subjected to the most effective judicial checks due to the severity of violating the constitution , " said schnarrenberger , who has previously served as germany 's justice minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : america embraces change obama becomes us president ; lays out challenges ahead european press review : welcome , president obama ! opinion : america 's new face world leaders , adversaries comment on obama inauguration trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 06.11.2008 us expert : obama will improve trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempe : relations between germany and the us will improve under obama with the election of barrack obama , change has come to the united states .
obama 's first challenge is to repair america 's reputation , says fred kempe , president of the atlantic council of the united states . deutsche welle : from your point of view , how would you describe the impact of the election of obama concerning the trans-atlantic relations between europe and america ?
fred kempe : it 's an understatement to say that this is a historic moment .
it is the first time any country in the world with a white , democratic majority has elected a minority - someone of color - to lead it .
what it brings us in the trans-atlantic relationship is a chance , but it 's also a chance that we need to seize .
there will be a change in domestic attitudes across europe towards the united states - toward us leadership - but the us must use that opportunity to reach out to europe but at the same time europeans must seize the opportunity to work more closely with the united states .
and my only fear is that if we do n't seize the opportunity , then we 'll be looking back one year from now as a historic moment lost to us .
so what are the first steps , the first challenges , that obama has to face ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fred kempe the first challenge is to repair america 's reputation .
it has a strategic impact when great majorities of germans , french , turks , africans , and asians do n't believe in american leadership .
if he changes that , it will make it easier for america to operate on the world stage .
the second thing he has to do - and he has to do this right away - is take on the global financial crisis .
my guess is that before nov .
15 , when we have the meeting of global leaders here in the united states on the global financial crisis , that obama will have already named his top financial leaders - his treasury secretary and others - and that they may cooperate in one form or another with the bush administration in that meeting .
in other words i think the transition will have to take place much more quickly that usual because of the crisis situation that we 're in .
let 's talk a little bit about afghanistan and iraq .
obama has already shown his ideas about afghanistan - talking about strengthening nato and reinforcing the mission in afghanistan .
what do you think about that ?
is it a good idea and will he be able to convince other european partners that it is ?
all the major european countries are already involved in afghanistan , but i do n't think that they 've explained to their populations , and in some cases to themselves , the strategic importance and value .
i think that obama will make requests of afghanistan that wo n't be unlike the requests of the bush administration .
he 'll be more sophisticated , he 'll be more skilled in how he makes these requests .
he 'll have a deeper understanding , for example , about domestic impediments for chancellor merkel in sending troops to the south of afghanistan .
but then he 'll say , " well ca n't you do that more economically ? " or " ca n't you do more to help us fight drugs ? "
so i think europe is going to be facing a leader to whom it is going to be more difficult to say no .
and the question is how will then european leaders respond ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has n't been a threat to russia in a long time , says kempe if europe manages to say no , will we see another face of obama that we do n't know yet ?
i think obama realizes he 's very skilled .
if one reads what he said about foreign policy over time , he understands the necessity in the world to work multilaterally , and he understands this grows out of a reduction in relative influence in the world .
which would happen no matter what ; we 've seen the rise of asia , we 've seen a surge in russia .
in any case , the us would have less influence and would have to work more closely with its partners to get anything done on the world stage .
i think obama will not let difficulties with partners blow out of proportion , but i do think he 's going to be forceful in saying what he wants .
the interesting thing to watch is will europeans also be forceful ?
will europe now come to the united states and say , this is what we now want to do in terms of climate , this is what we now want to do in terms of the middle east , so that you have a true partnership going for it .
i think there is a historic moment to do that .
so how does europe have to change its attitudes and ideas towards america ?
to understand that the global security issues that america talks about and pays so much to defend are also european issues .
europe has been so engaged with its own internal issues in bringing about the european union that it has n't been as externally focused as america would like it to be .
now you have a united states that is quite eager to have a closer relationship with the european union .
it is quite eager to have the european union and european countries as partners on the world stage , but i think that what europe will have to do is come together , which is always difficult with so many countries as part of the european union , and be clear also about what role it wants to play with america on the world stage .
i think it could require a whole new way of communicating with each other , bringing the eu , nato and other members together , perhaps in a new institution or form of some sort , on a regular basis , so that one is talking over strategic issues in a regular way at the highest levels in both europe and the united states .
let 's talk about another conflict , which may be the ukraine and georgia and their membership in nato .
what do you think obama can do to get both those countries into nato without angering russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like jfk , people might put obama 's photo on the wall , says kempe russia is a problem at the moment that is not going to go away , and there are disagreements also within europe about how to deal with russia .
poland , the baltic states and even england do n't see the issue in the same terms as , say , the french and the germans .
and the french and the germans also see it a bit differently .
so the real question is can one come together with a mixture of carrots and sticks ?
carrots to better integrate russia in our security and economic institutions , but at the same time across europe to say very clearly to russia that it 's really up to its neighbors to decide what institutions that they want to belong to .
nato , for many years already , is really no longer a threat of any sort to russia .
and one has to make it clear to russia that they do n't control the sovereign decisions of their neighbors .
that is what obama will want to say and that is the stand he will want to take and the real question is whether the german leaders and french leaders want to say that quite as clearly .
so will there be this change in foreign policy that obama promised ?
yes .
i think the most important thing that he understands , and he said that clearly last night , is that he understands that the united states ' superpower status has n't just been based on military and economic power , it 's also been based on a power of ideas and a certain moral power .
i think he 's going to bring that back into his foreign policy .
i remember when i was growing up , john f. kennedy 's photograph was on the wall in many of my german relatives ' -lrb- homes -rrb- .
i think that in africa , in places in the middle east , and across europe many people will see obama as a kind of president where you can put his picture on the wall .
and i do think one thing we will be very clear : he 's a great danger to radical extremists who are anti-american .
he 's a great danger to al qaeda , because he 's going to take away this picture they 've been drawing of america by his mere presence .
so i think in many respects and on many levels i think us foreign policy will be much more effective , even if the problems do n't change . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.11.2008 medvedev challenges us , hopes obama means change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev blamed the us for the georgian war and the financial crisis russian president dmitry medvedev nominally said he hoped for improved ties with the new us president , but also that russia would fight us missile defense plans by deploying missiles near poland . in his first state-of-the-nation speech since taking office in may , medvedev on wednesday , nov .
5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .
moscow drew heavy criticism from the west for its intervention in us-ally georgia 's breakaway regions , which it recognized as independent after the war in august . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , did not mention president-elect barack obama by name and lashed out at the united states ' , seeming to challenge its policy on all fronts .
medvedev , 43 , began the address in the kremlin 's most sumptuous st. george hall by charging washington with encouraging georgia 's " barbaric aggression , " which russia says led it into a five-day war in georgia 's separatist region of south ossetia in august .
he said the us had used the war as a pretext for nato enlargement , which moscow views along with the missile defense plans as a us-led threat to its security , and placed blame for the global financial crisis on us " selfish " and " reckless " policies .
hope for better ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow hopes for improved ties with washington russia 's relations with the us deteriorated under the presidencies of medvedev 's predecessor vladimir putin and us president george w. bush , unraveling cooperation on non-nuclear proliferation , iran and other issues .
" i would like to stress that we have no problems with the american people .
we have no inherent anti-americanism , " medvedev said in the nationally televised address .
but he placed the onus on obama 's new administration to seek compromise , saying he hoped they would " make a choice in favor of fully-fledged relations with russia . "
missile stand-off in eastern europe the kremlin leader also called for an extension of the presidential term from four to six years among other political reforms that will set washington on watch for any back-tracking on what it already views as a frail democracy in russia .
the announcement that moscow would deploy short-range iskander missiles in its baltic sea enclave kaliningrad bordering with poland was the first detailing of retaliatory steps russia has said it would take to counter a us missile shield in eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile defense shield ruffled some feather in eastern europe medvedev added that the navy would also be called upon and an electronic-blocking radar would be deployed to impair the us missile elements planned in poland and the czech republic .
he did not did not say whether the iskander installations would be nuclear armed .
minutes into his speech wednesday , medvedev blamed us policy for recklessness in spreading its financial ills to global markets and it could no longer stand up as the underwriter of the global financial order .
blame for financial crisis , georgian war " we need to create mechanisms that would block erroneous , egotistical and sometimes even dangerous decisions by some members of the global community , " medvedev said .
he added russia 's recent war with georgia was a product of us self-interests and unilateral foreign policy that was detrimental to the stability of the volatile region and the greater security order .
medvedev added that washington had sought to use the war in georgia to push forward nato expansion along russia 's borders beyond its conventional purview as a western military alliance .
" the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for sending nato warships to the black sea and then for the forceful foisting on europe of the us ' anti-missile systems , which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by russia , " medvedev told the assembled parliamentary officials .
his hawkish criticism of us foreign policy aped putin 's resurgent and confrontational foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under putin and bush , ties were cordial but cool after the war with georgia , putin accused one of the us presidential candidates of trumping up the conflict to improve his chances of victory , and said the war will be as important in shaping future russian foreign policy as 9/11 was to the us .
expecting a ' fresh approach ' from obama but other top russian officials anticipated that obama meant a possibility for a thaw in relations .
he is widely seen in russia as more open to dialogue and flexible on issues such as missile defense where his rival john mccain was viewed as representing a throwback to cold war policy of containment .
shortly after ribbing the united states in his address , medvedev telegrammed congratulations to obama , stressing the importance of cooperation between the two countries for global security .
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he anticipated a " fresh approach " from the us under obama that leaves behind the " stereotypes " for cold war confrontation .
" we believe that the us president will himself shape the tone of relations with russia .
as to the president 's advisors , they will also have the possibility to look in a new way at the old approaches and maybe to review the stereotypes that earlier were intrinsic to them , " karasin told news agency interfax on wednesday .
moscow drew heavy criticism from the west for its intervention in us-ally georgia 's breakaway regions , which it recognized as independent after the war in august . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the ministry then made another negative decision and the unhcr issued another unfavorable report , bin laden would be expelled immediately . omar bin laden , who has publicly urged his father to abandon terrorism , was being held at madrid airport .
he arrived on flight from cairo to casablanca , which made a stopover in madrid on monday . in april , britain denied a visa to bin laden , who is married to a british citizen . dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .

but is it really green fuel ?
worried by the potential damage to the climate , the eu wants to introduce tough environmental standards for biofuels it purchases .
but some developing nations say this would n't be fair , and they may file a wto complaint . eight developing countries have told the eu that they might file a world trade organization complaint unless europe reconsiders its new proposals on biofuels .
the eu is set to decide on tougher biofuel regulations in the coming weeks .
until recently biofuels were considered an exciting new source of renewable energy , creating fuel from plants like rapeseed .
but environmentalists charge that using grains and oilseeds for fuel has pushed up food prices and forced farmers to start hacking into rainforests and draining wetlands in order to expand their agricultural output .
these concerns have resonated with the eu , and so the bloc intends to introduce new restrictions defining what type of land is suitable for creating biofuels .
if the plans were to go ahead , fuels coming from what brussels deems to be ecologically unsound sources would not be purchased by eu member states .
producers consider action over unfair treatment argentina , brazil , colombia , malawi , mozambique , sierra leone , indonesia and malaysia have written a letter of complaint to the eu , criticising these new proposals , and threatening action unless brussels reconsiders : bildunterschrift : rainforests like these are threatened by biofuels “ they impose unjustifiably complex requirements on producers , ” said the draft letter , which was obtained by the news agency reuters .
“ some of our countries do n't exclude the possibility of defending their rights in the world trade organisation , as a last resort . ”
the biofuel producers say that this legislation amounts to a double standard .
european nations have already expanded into their wild areas so as to improve their overall quality of life , so europeans have no right to stop other countries from doing the same , they argue : “ provisions relating to land-use change will impinge disproportionately on developing countries , where there are stocks of undeveloped arable land which can be used for biofuels production , ” the letter said .
greener fuels in light of un warnings about fossil fuel usage and clmate change , the european commission , the home of new eu laws , has proposed that 10 percent of all road transport fuel should come from renewable sources by 2020 .
much of that 10 percent would come from biofuels , creating a huge potential market on which nations like brazil and indonesia are keen to capitalize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your car most likely runs with some biofuels in it too but as biofuels lose their popularity and their reputation as a truly green source of fuel , the eu has begun looking for other sources of alternative energy .
the spike in food prices over the last few years has also contributed to the move away from biofuels .
the eu is planning to reduce the amount of fuels it purchases which are made from staple food crops like brazilian sugar .
the cap is currently at 10 per cent , but brussels intends to reduce that maximum limit to six percent instead .
selling sugar as a fuel source is more lucrative than selling sugar as sugar . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .
in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty . " a major conference is set to be held in the danish capital of copenhagen in 2009 to decide what will replace the kyoto framework , which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .

the ecb has now slashed rates by 100 basis points in just four weeks , while the boe has trimmed rates by 250 basis points in a month . analysts expect both banks to follow up thursday 's cuts with more reductions in borrowing costs in the coming months and predict that rates could be as low as 2 percent by the middle of next year . the global drive to lower rates also forms part of the build-up to a meeting of european union leaders in brussels friday and a larger gathering of the group of 20 government chiefs in washington in a week to discuss measures for dealing with the global financial crisis . world-wide cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england 's cuts have been more aggressive indeed , this week 's ecb and boe reductions also come in the wake of new wave of rate cuts around the world lead by the us federal reserve and the bank of japan . the monetary authorities in norway , slovakia , the czech republic , south korea , taiwan , israel and china have also reduced the cost of money in the run-up to thursday 's boe 's nine-member monetary committee meeting in london and the ecb 's 21-head governing council gathering in frankfurt . on tuesday , australia 's reserve bank delivered its third rate cut in as many months slashing rates by a hefty 75 basis points . more to the point , the gloomy global economic outlook and falling inflation is giving central banks around the world room to move on borrowing costs . eurozone inflation slipped to 3.2 percent in october from 3.6 percent in september on falling oil prices .
preliminary data released last week showed business confidence in the currency bloc plunging to a 15-year low . the eurozone economy is expected to grow by a feeble 0.1 percent next year , the european commission said in its latest projections released monday inflation would sink to 2.2 per cent next year . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

various groups are calling for obama to back up his green campaign talk . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he does not expect a radical change in us climate policy after barack obama takes over as president . " america as a whole is not ready for the contribution it needs to make in order to lessen the negative affects of global warming , " steinmeier said . " the dominant issue in the us has always been energy security .
in addition , there are the considerations on how it can make itself independent of uncertain suppliers like venezuela , " the foreign minister said . the minister told an environmental conference in freiburg , southern germany , that washington would take pains to ensure climate protection measures do not harm the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier democrat barack obama won the us presidential election on tuesday and will take over from president george w. bush on january 20 , 2009 . his victory has raised hopes that the us will change the approach to climate change of the bush administration , which refused to sign the kyoto agreement on curbing carbon pollution . steinmeier said the world as a whole has to work more closely together to create a " new green deal . " " climate change is one of the challenges which we can either solve together or fail on together , " said steinmeier , who is due to face off again angela merkel for the chancellorship next september . calls for ' proof ' other green groups , including investors , lobbyists and bankers around the world are calling for obama to prove that the us will change its approach to climate change under his administration . in his acceptance speech tuesday night , obama called climate change a top priority , but investors , analysts and others are aware that reviving a stalled economy will take precedence over dealing with carbon trading programs and the development of clean energy . analysts have been wary of obama 's campaign promises , doubting that he will delivery on cap and trade programs or investing over $ 150 billion over 10 years in low-carbon energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy could trump environmental issues " i 'd like to see the first $ 15 billion funded in his first budget , " said mark diesendorf , environmental and sustainable energy analyst at australia 's university of new south wales . but the fact that the us government is low on cash while observing rising unemployment and falling profits across various industrial sectors could mean a halt sweeping plans during obama 's first year in office . " he 's certainly committed to a very aggressive reduction target , but the economic downturn suggests that there may be a light-start approach , similar to what we had in europe , " said abyd karmali , global head of emissions trading at merrill lynch . german groups hopeful despite the worries , environmental groups in germany still have high expectations for the future president and have praised his talk of expanding renewable energy programs and encouraging more efficiency and energy savings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in from of the white house urging president bush to sign the kyoto protocol - it did n't work " many environmental groups are putting a lot of hope in obama , " said hubert weiger of the green group bund .
" like all industrialized countries , the us has to move to a sustainable economic model . " the environmental group nabu also expressed its hope that an obama adminstration would have a fundamentally different approach to climate protection than outgoing us president bush . " but obama must ensure that the us immediately begins to play a constructive role in international un negotiations for a post-kyoto treaty .

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .
despite the club showing signs of improvement , bayern has started the season sluggishly – so much so that there were rumours of klinsmann getting the sack just a few matches into the season .

a late goal from tim borowski meant that bayern munich snatched a clutch draw against fiorentina in the champions ' league .
bayern 's lead in group f now looks insurmountable , and a place in the knock-out stages beckons . coach juergen klinsmann admitted after the game that bayern munich could easily have lost in florence , though he did think that a draw was a fair reflection of the game .
the hosts fiorentina grabbed the lead after 11 minutes , when romanian international striker adrian mutu volleyed the ball home after some nice work on the right flank by luciano zauri .
then for around an hour it was a largely one-sided match , with fiorentina pushing forward , looking for their second goal .
michael rensing in the bayern goal was really earning his wages in the first half , making a string of crucial saves .
the club 's outspoken captain and midfield hard-man mark van bommel was disappointed with his side 's showing : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian mutu opened the scoring in florence “ we did n't play well in the first half , we showed too much respect and deserved to be a goal behind , ” the dutchman said .
but in the closing stages fiorentina 's back line went on the missing list and began ball-watching .
sniffing a chance , frenchman franck ribery threaded the ball through the italians ' static defence , and tim borowski latched on to it inside the box and slotted the ball home .
this 78th minute goal undid over an hour of good work from the hosts in just the blink of an eye .
the fiorentina coach cesare prandelli said his team could have won the match if his players were a little more experienced on the big stage : “ we were excellent for 70 minutes and then we collapsed , ” prandelli lamented .
“ we should have concentrated better . ”
one foot in the knockout stages bayern munich could have even taken victory , with the best of a slew of late chances falling to forward miroslav klose .
he did the hard work , beating his man and getting a great look at the goal , but then blazed his shot over the bar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often the bayern stars were chasing shadows “ we wanted to avoid a defeat , so 1-1 is just fine , ” klose said after the match .
the draw means bayern remain top of group f in the champions ' league group phase , level on points with second position lyon .
fiorentina are in third , five points adrift , and considering that the top two sides in the group proceed to the next round , it would take a minor miracle for the italian outfit to oust either lyon or bayern with only two matches remaining .
“ it 's a really important point because it leaves fiorentina well behind us and now we have a good chance of qualifying from the group , ” bayern coach juergen klinsmann told reporters after the game .
“ at half time we spoke about the need to find another gear and summoning up the desire to go out and score the goal we wanted .
in the second half you sensed it was only a matter of time before we forced one over the line . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern last won the champions league in 2001 welcome good news new bayern coach juergen klinsmann is still clinging to the positives of his reign at bayern munich .

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't only the timing that was off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . originally , russia 's medvedev wanted to hold his speech on the state of the nation in front of both chambers of the russian parliament at the end of october .
but then he posponed it until nov .
5 , just hours after the us presidential election .
given the tense relations between the west and russia , there probably could n't have been a worse time for a strategic speech by the russian president than this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel medvedev 's avoidance of the kind of fierce anti-american statements favored by some other russian politicians speaks to his better political instincts .
still , it was unfortunate that medvedev held the talk so shortly after obama 's victory . the repetition of the rather simplistic viewpoint that the us is responsible for the war in georgia , the financial crisis and every other ill afflicting the planet might have seemed convincing to some russian ears , but it did nothing to address the complex realities of these issues .
and it is not shared by countries in europe , despite their often pointed criticism of washington , especially after americans voted for political change along with barack obama . russia 's opposition to the us missile defense system in poland and the czech republic is already well known .
but the part of the speech that will stay in the minds of western politicians and citizens is medvedev 's announcement that moscow will station short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad . even if the military significance of russian missiles in the middle of europe is limited , it burnishes the image of an aggressive russia .
the missile plan is meant to show russia 's strength , but really it strengthens europe 's fear of russia . stoking fears medvedev did n't do himself any favors with the timing of his speech or the foreign policy annoucement , even though some kremlinologists believe he did offer something interesting : namely a reform program that includes lowering the seven-percent hurdle parties need to enter parliament and simplifying rules around party and candidate registration .
such changes could indicate careful efforts to liberalize the political structures created by medvedev 's predecessor , vladimir putin . medvedev 's harsh criticism of the all-powerful state bureaucracy and his plans for an education offensive illustrate that the president has understood where some of russia 's real problems lie .
but while some of these propositions may fascinate russia experts , they have almost no effect on public opinion in europe . that 's because obama 's victory and the end of george w. bush 's eight-year tenure signal the start of a new phase in trans-atlantic relations , which russia wants no part of .
and while europe and the us do not agree on every political issue , moscow should realize that for europe - and also for germany - the partnership with the us takes priority . europe 's relationship with russia is important but not on the same level as the trans-atlantic one , even if that is something russia does n't like to hear . europe 's feelings about the us were illustrated by the strong interest here in the recent us election , and also by the overwhelming european enthusiasm over obama 's victory .
the only part of medvedev 's speech that will be remembered : moscow is putting new missiles in kaliningrad . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welle 's russian radio and online departments . -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" overall , for most forms of consumption , we are not seeing major increases , and , in some areas , trends appear to be downwards , " said wolfgang goetz , head of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- on thursday , november 6 .
the emcdda 's 2008 annual report shows a steady or declining use among europeans of amphetamine and ecstasy , while there are signs that consumption of cannabis - by far the most popular illicit drug in europe - is falling among young people in some countries .
in germany , for instance , 11.9 per cent of those aged between 15 and 34 years old reported using cannabis in 2006 , compared to 14.6 per cent in 2003 .
a similar trend has been observed in england and wales , where the number of young adults who say they consume cannabis fell from 19.6 per cent in 2000 to 15.6 per cent in the 2006-07 period .
cocaine and heroin growing in popularity the survey also confirms the growing popularity of cocaine , which is now consumed by some 3.5 million young europeans each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine remains popular the highest number of consumers of this drug among 15 to 34 year olds is found in denmark , ireland , italy , britain and spain , which recorded a european peak of 5.2 per cent in 2006 .
however , the biggest concern of the lisbon-based agency remains heroin , which is responsible for up to 8,000 deaths in europe each year and is consumed by between 1.3 and 1.7 million people across the continent .
while " current evidence does not point to an epidemic growth in heroin problems , " the emcdda notes a 10 per cent increase in the number of seizures in europe during the 2003-06 period .
according to the united nations ' office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- , opium production in the world 's biggest supplier - afghanistan - totaled 7,700 tons this year , only slightly down from the 2007 record production of 8,200 tons .
" we can not ignore the threat posed by the glut of heroin now available on the world market , " goetz said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 19.09.2008 -rrb- dw-world : frankfurt still germany 's drug capital , but learning to cope frankfurt has long been struggling to contain its drug scene .
new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities .
-lrb- 12.07.2008 -rrb- dw-world : stressed-out students turning to drugs , study says germany 's new bachelor 's and master 's courses are whittling away the time students devote to their degrees .

the forests around verdun , where so many died , are still and silent .
nature has smoothed countryside torn up by shellfire , and undermined by the men who sheltered from it .
ahead on the carpet of brightly coloured autumn leaves , christina holstein forced her way through low hanging branches to follow a trail she knows well .
ms holstein , a british expat now living in luxembourg , has made the wartime history of this area her speciality and runs tours of the verdun battlefield .
on the first day of our trip across the area , she had offered to show us how events of nine decades ago had left an indelible mark on the landscape .
' moving silence ' stumbling over tree roots , ducking beneath brambles , we found what we were looking for .
there in front were the unmistakeable features of french trenches - deep channels , virtually unchanged , that sheltered men struggling to and from the front line . "
so much of suffering here was for so little gain , it should never happen again " christina holstein , tour guide here and there , the dark mouths of the dugouts that provided some safety from the shelling , or the concrete fire steps from which riflemen and machine-gunners could engage an enemy hunkered down in identical trenches less than a 100 metres away .
a quarter of a million french and german soldiers died in the savage fighting around the town of verdun , the bones of those who could not be identified lie beneath the floor of the giant ossuary which dominates the forest skyline .
after the war , much of the land could neither be farmed nor built on , and it was left untouched as a national memorial .
" it 's the silence that i find most moving , " ms holstein said , gazing across what was once no man 's land .
" so much of suffering here was for so little gain , it should never happen again . "
warning signs the following day , i stood high above another battlefield , far to the north-west .
vimy ridge stands witness to the losses sustained by men who had come to fight a war thousands of miles from home .
in 1917 , the canadian corps attacked and captured german positions on the hills around arras .
more than 3,000 canadians died .
the shell holes and trenches are now covered by a manicured carpet of grass - canada has adopted this corner of france as its own memorial .
the warning signs remind visitors that unexploded shells and grenades lie where they fell .
on the crest of the hill , the giant figure of a grieving mother , cut from gleaming white stone , looks down on a tomb .
a few yards away sections of the allied and german trenches have been preserved .
steps lead to the network of tunnels bored by british engineers , stretching back more than a mile from the front .
i stood in the semi-darkness and tried to imagine the fear and the courage of young men waiting for the whistles that would summon so many of them to certain death in the bloody chaos above .
never forget then onward to our final destination .
the ypres salient was a bulge in the allied front line .
for much of the great war , the germans dominated high ground on three sides , pulverising ypres and turning poorly drained farmland into a quagmire .
two great battles took place here , resulting in carnage on a horrific scale .
near the village of passendale , the headstones that mark the passing of almost 12,000 allied soldiers line the gentle slope in neat ranks .
standing among them , i looked down the slope towards ypres , behind me the cross of remembrance has been erected on top of one of the german pillboxes that directed fire onto the allied advance .
beyond it , the wall which bears the names of 30,000 more men whose remains were never identified .
that evening , as is the case every night , hundreds stood in silence for the last post ceremony under ypres ' menin gate .
at its close i chatted to some of the schoolchildren who had laid wreaths .
until now , the great war was just another episode in their history curriculum .
now they say this visit to the battlefields has reinforced their view that they too must not forget .

the forests around verdun , where so many died , are still and silent .
nature has smoothed countryside torn up by shellfire , and undermined by the men who sheltered from it .
ahead on the carpet of brightly coloured autumn leaves , christina holstein forced her way through low hanging branches to follow a trail she knows well .
ms holstein , a british expat now living in luxembourg , has made the wartime history of this area her speciality and runs tours of the verdun battlefield .
on the first day of our trip across the area , she had offered to show us how events of nine decades ago had left an indelible mark on the landscape .
' moving silence ' stumbling over tree roots , ducking beneath brambles , we found what we were looking for .
there in front were the unmistakeable features of french trenches - deep channels , virtually unchanged , that sheltered men struggling to and from the front line .
so much of suffering here was for so little gain , it should never happen again christina holstein , tour guide here and there , the dark mouths of the dugouts that provided some safety from the shelling , or the concrete fire steps from which riflemen and machine-gunners could engage an enemy hunkered down in identical trenches less than a 100 metres away .
a quarter of a million french and german soldiers died in the savage fighting around the town of verdun , the bones of those who could not be identified lie beneath the floor of the giant ossuary which dominates the forest skyline .
after the war , much of the land could neither be farmed nor built on , and it was left untouched as a national memorial .
" it 's the silence that i find most moving , " ms holstein said , gazing across what was once no man 's land .
" so much of suffering here was for so little gain , it should never happen again . "
warning signs the following day , i stood high above another battlefield , far to the north-west .
vimy ridge stands witness to the losses sustained by men who had come to fight a war thousands of miles from home .
ms holstein runs tours of the former battlefields in 1917 , the canadian corps attacked and captured german positions on the hills around arras .
more than 3,000 canadians died .
the shell holes and trenches are now covered by a manicured carpet of grass - canada has adopted this corner of france as its own memorial .
the warning signs remind visitors that unexploded shells and grenades lie where they fell .
on the crest of the hill , the giant figure of a grieving mother , cut from gleaming white stone , looks down on a tomb .
a few yards away sections of the allied and german trenches have been preserved .
steps lead to the network of tunnels bored by british engineers , stretching back more than a mile from the front .
i stood in the semi-darkness and tried to imagine the fear and the courage of young men waiting for the whistles that would summon so many of them to certain death in the bloody chaos above .
never forget then onward to our final destination .
thousands of commonwealth soldiers are buried near passendale the ypres salient was a bulge in the allied front line .
for much of the great war , the germans dominated high ground on three sides , pulverising ypres and turning poorly drained farmland into a quagmire .
two great battles took place here , resulting in carnage on a horrific scale .
near the village of passendale , the headstones that mark the passing of almost 12,000 allied soldiers line the gentle slope in neat ranks .
standing among them , i looked down the slope towards ypres , behind me the cross of remembrance has been erected on top of one of the german pillboxes that directed fire onto the allied advance .
beyond it , the wall which bears the names of 30,000 more men whose remains were never identified .
that evening , as is the case every night , hundreds stood in silence for the last post ceremony under ypres ' menin gate .
at its close i chatted to some of the schoolchildren who had laid wreaths .
until now , the great war was just another episode in their history curriculum .
now they say this visit to the battlefields has reinforced their view that they too must not forget .

the forests around verdun , where so many died , are still and silent .
nature has smoothed countryside torn up by shellfire , and undermined by the men who sheltered from it .
ahead on the carpet of brightly coloured autumn leaves , christina holstein forced her way through low hanging branches to follow a trail she knows well .
ms holstein , a british expat now living in luxembourg , has made the wartime history of this area her speciality and runs tours of the verdun battlefield .
on the first day of our trip across the area , she had offered to show us how events of nine decades ago had left an indelible mark on the landscape .
' moving silence ' stumbling over tree roots , ducking beneath brambles , we found what we were looking for .
there in front were the unmistakeable features of french trenches - deep channels , virtually unchanged , that sheltered men struggling to and from the front line .
so much of suffering here was for so little gain , it should never happen again christina holstein , tour guide here and there , the dark mouths of the dugouts that provided some safety from the shelling , or the concrete fire steps from which riflemen and machine-gunners could engage an enemy hunkered down in identical trenches less than a 100 metres away .
a quarter of a million french and german soldiers died in the savage fighting around the town of verdun , the bones of those who could not be identified lie beneath the floor of the giant ossuary which dominates the forest skyline .
after the war , much of the land could neither be farmed nor built on , and it was left untouched as a national memorial .
" it 's the silence that i find most moving , " ms holstein said , gazing across what was once no man 's land .
" so much of suffering here was for so little gain , it should never happen again . "
warning signs the following day , i stood high above another battlefield , far to the north-west .

ms holstein runs tours of the former battlefields in 1917 , the canadian corps attacked and captured german positions on the hills around arras .
more than 3,000 canadians died .
the shell holes and trenches are now covered by a manicured carpet of grass - canada has adopted this corner of france as its own memorial .
the warning signs remind visitors that unexploded shells and grenades lie where they fell .
on the crest of the hill , the giant figure of a grieving mother , cut from gleaming white stone , looks down on a tomb .
a few yards away sections of the allied and german trenches have been preserved .
steps lead to the network of tunnels bored by british engineers , stretching back more than a mile from the front .
i stood in the semi-darkness and tried to imagine the fear and the courage of young men waiting for the whistles that would summon so many of them to certain death in the bloody chaos above .
never forget then onward to our final destination .
thousands of commonwealth soldiers are buried near passendale the ypres salient was a bulge in the allied front line .
for much of the great war , the germans dominated high ground on three sides , pulverising ypres and turning poorly drained farmland into a quagmire .
two great battles took place here , resulting in carnage on a horrific scale .
near the village of passendale , the headstones that mark the passing of almost 12,000 allied soldiers line the gentle slope in neat ranks .
standing among them , i looked down the slope towards ypres , behind me the cross of remembrance has been erected on top of one of the german pillboxes that directed fire onto the allied advance .

the discovery points to the potential importance of hormone levels in both .
the study of 3,412 women suggests a 30 % lower risk for people with a history of disabling headaches .
however , the researchers , from the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle , warned more work was needed to confirm the link .
while these results need to be interpreted with caution , they point to a possible new factor that may be related to breast cancer risk dr christopher li fred hutchinson cancer center while an estimated 30 % of women will suffer at least one migraine in their lifetime , for a much smaller group , they are a regular feature .
scientists have connected the condition , which can feature nausea and visual disturbances alongside severe headaches , with fluctuating levels of hormones .
being pregnant , or on the contraceptive pill , both of which affect hormone levels , can lead to noticeable changes in the frequency and severity of attacks .
the us researchers are the first to look at whether this might have an effect on the chances of developing breast cancer , which , in two of its most common forms is fuelled by the hormones oestrogen and progesterone .
their group of women included 1,938 who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and 1,474 who had no history of the disease .
women were asked to report whether they had ever been diagnosed with migraines by a health professional .
those with a history of migraines were far less likely to go on to develop breast cancer .
caution urged dr christopher li , reporting the results in the journal cancer epidemiology , biomarkers and prevention , said that the hormone hypothesis appeared the most likely .
a high-oestrogen state , he said , such as that found in pregnancy , could be linked to both a reduction in attacks , and the conditions needed to stimulate breast cancer development .
he said : " while these results need to be interpreted with caution , they point to a possible new factor that may be related to breast cancer risk .

the discovery points to the potential importance of hormone levels in both .
the study of 3,412 women suggests a 30 % lower risk for people with a history of disabling headaches .
however , the researchers , from the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle , warned more work was needed to confirm the link .
while these results need to be interpreted with caution , they point to a possible new factor that may be related to breast cancer risk dr christopher li fred hutchinson cancer center while an estimated 30 % of women will suffer at least one migraine in their lifetime , for a much smaller group , they are a regular feature .
scientists have connected the condition , which can feature nausea and visual disturbances alongside severe headaches , with fluctuating levels of hormones .
being pregnant , or on the contraceptive pill , both of which affect hormone levels , can lead to noticeable changes in the frequency and severity of attacks .
the us researchers are the first to look at whether this might have an effect on the chances of developing breast cancer , which , in two of its most common forms is fuelled by the hormones oestrogen and progesterone .
their group of women included 1,938 who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and 1,474 who had no history of the disease .
women were asked to report whether they had ever been diagnosed with migraines by a health professional .
those with a history of migraines were far less likely to go on to develop breast cancer .
caution urged dr christopher li , reporting the results in the journal cancer epidemiology , biomarkers and prevention , said that the hormone hypothesis appeared the most likely .
a high-oestrogen state , he said , such as that found in pregnancy , could be linked to both a reduction in attacks , and the conditions needed to stimulate breast cancer development .
he said : " while these results need to be interpreted with caution , they point to a possible new factor that may be related to breast cancer risk .
" this gives us a new avenue to explore the biology behind risk reduction . "

the wales audit office said the system can be complex and " can be confusing " .
it will also look at experiences of gp out-of-hours services and the nhs direct phone-line advice service .
earlier this week , a coroner in mid wales found a " systemic failure " after a patient died after trying to call an ambulance and reach her local surgery .
ruth hedge , 60 , died of natural causes at her home in borth , ceredigion in april 2007 , but her cause of death was " aggravated by neglect " said the coroner . "
there is confusion at the present time , there 's no doubt about that " carol jones , board of community health councils in wales michael howells said at her inquest , mrs hedge 's death could have been avoided .
an ambulance had been stood down because her case was not seen as serious enough but it also emerged she had experiences difficulties in contacting her local surgery and using an out-of-hours service .
mr howells said mrs hedge would have been " thoroughly confused " after her series of phone calls .
the wales audit office said patients may go to one particular service when it would have been better for them to have gone somewhere else .
it said it is taking what it calls an " unusual step " in asking for people 's help in assessing how easy it is to use emergency health care and also nhs care in the home .
the survey will also look at handover targets in a & e departments .
although it can not investigate individual cases , the study team said it is interested in hearing people 's views and experiences of so-called " unscheduled care " - such as emergency hospital treatment , or where patients need help to care for themselves at home .
auditor general jeremy colman said : " it 's actually rather unusual for us to issue a consultation of this kind but what we 're looking into is all the various ways in which people can get unscheduled care in the nhs , and there are a great many ways in which unscheduled care arises .
" we want to hear directly from citizens , the people who experience it , what it 's like , good experiences and some less good experiences .
" this will help us design a study which we hope will lead to big improvements in the way unscheduled care operates in wales . "
carol jones , director of the board of community health councils in wales , said she believed there were " too many points of contact " between patients and the health service .
" the welsh assembly government and public health department need to work together to look at how the members of the public can learn what they need to do to get either a gp appointment or when it 's appropriate to phone for an ambulance .
" there is confusion at the present time , there 's no doubt about that . "
patient experiences will form part of a study to assess where bottlenecks and problems are occurring and to make improvements .
the audit office also wants ideas on how the current system could be improved .
it is asking people to contact them with their views by filling in an online unscheduled care questionnaire or by calling through on 029 2032 0610 .
here are a selection of some of your experiences of using nhs doctors or a & e services in an emergency .
as a qualified nurse , in a particular home , a patient had pulled their feed tube out at 8pm .
in order for my patient not to be admitted to hospital for an operation to have the tube re-inserted , it needed to be replaced within the hour at the home -lrb- a procedure now carried out routinely by rapid response -rrb- .
i contacted rapid response , as we had been instructed to do .
they were unable to attend - only one person in the county and she was at the other end of the county .
asked me to prime care - they would phone back within 30 minutes .
one and a half hours later , i contacted prime call again , to no avail .
they stated that all the ambulances were backed up at the local general hospital , patients were being treated in them , and even if i were to dial 999 - no ambulances were available !
my patient was eventually ' admitted ' at about 2 a.m.
jane , wales we seem to forget that the 999 ambulance service is for life threatening emergencies and not a free taxi service or as an alternative to the gp services .
if emergency ambulances are sent to all those who dial 999 who are not emergencies then those with life threatening conditions will have to wait even longer for emergency ambulances and we will have more deaths .
the reason why gps were in ambulance control assessing calls is because there are so many people call the 999 services when it is inappropriate to do so .
there needs to be more public awareness on who to contact and when , phoning 999 for non-emergencies creates this problem and costs lives .
in my three decades of nursing , including working in a & e for many of those , i have seen first hand the misuse of a & e services , the 999 services and the emergency out of hours gp services for situations and conditions that are not emergencies and can be seen by the gp as a routine case .
a high percentage of people attending a & e do n't need to be there , again a high percentage of people arriving at a & e via an ambulance can walk off the ambulance , if you can walk off an ambulance by definition you do not need an emergency ambulance !
again the out of hours gp service is there for emergency and urgent cases and not to be used because you can not see your own gp or have minor symptoms .
by using these services incorrectly this is causing long waiting times in a & e , delaying ambulances going to true emergencies and delaying the out of hours gp from seeing people who need them .
it is easy to blame the a & e 's , gp 's , ambulance service and nhs direct for these problems -lrb- often done by those who do not understand these services or want to jump on the ' bandwagon ' of blame -rrb- when it is due to the public misusing the out of hours and emergency services .
we need to educate the public to the correct use of these services and how to access the correct medical services at the correct time for the correct reason .

the wales audit office said the system can be complex and " can be confusing " .
it will also look at experiences of gp out-of-hours services and the nhs direct phone-line advice service .
earlier this week , a coroner in mid wales found a " systemic failure " after a patient died after trying to call an ambulance and reach her local surgery .
ruth hedge , 60 , died of natural causes at her home in borth , ceredigion in april 2007 , but her cause of death was " aggravated by neglect " said the coroner .
there is confusion at the present time , there 's no doubt about that carol jones , board of community health councils in wales michael howells said at her inquest , mrs hedge 's death could have been avoided .
an ambulance had been stood down because her case was not seen as serious enough but it also emerged she had experiences difficulties in contacting her local surgery and using an out-of-hours service .
mr howells said mrs hedge would have been " thoroughly confused " after her series of phone calls .
the wales audit office said patients may go to one particular service when it would have been better for them to have gone somewhere else .
it said it is taking what it calls an " unusual step " in asking for people 's help in assessing how easy it is to use emergency health care and also nhs care in the home .
ruth hedge tried to contact a gp and also called an ambulance before her death the survey will also look at handover targets in a & e departments .
although it can not investigate individual cases , the study team said it is interested in hearing people 's views and experiences of so-called " unscheduled care " - such as emergency hospital treatment , or where patients need help to care for themselves at home .
auditor general jeremy colman said : " it 's actually rather unusual for us to issue a consultation of this kind but what we 're looking into is all the various ways in which people can get unscheduled care in the nhs , and there are a great many ways in which unscheduled care arises .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
" we want to hear directly from citizens , the people who experience it , what it 's like , good experiences and some less good experiences .
" this will help us design a study which we hope will lead to big improvements in the way unscheduled care operates in wales . "
carol jones , director of the board of community health councils in wales , said she believed there were " too many points of contact " between patients and the health service .
" the welsh assembly government and public health department need to work together to look at how the members of the public can learn what they need to do to get either a gp appointment or when it 's appropriate to phone for an ambulance .
" there is confusion at the present time , there 's no doubt about that . "
patient experiences will form part of a study to assess where bottlenecks and problems are occurring and to make improvements .
the audit office also wants ideas on how the current system could be improved .
it is asking people to contact them with their views by filling in an online unscheduled care questionnaire or by calling through on 029 2032 0610 .
here are a selection of some of your experiences of using nhs doctors or a & e services in an emergency .
as a qualified nurse , in a particular home , a patient had pulled their feed tube out at 8pm .
in order for my patient not to be admitted to hospital for an operation to have the tube re-inserted , it needed to be replaced within the hour at the home -lrb- a procedure now carried out routinely by rapid response -rrb- .
i contacted rapid response , as we had been instructed to do .
they were unable to attend - only one person in the county and she was at the other end of the county .
asked me to prime care - they would phone back within 30 minutes .
one and a half hours later , i contacted prime call again , to no avail .
they stated that all the ambulances were backed up at the local general hospital , patients were being treated in them , and even if i were to dial 999 - no ambulances were available !
my patient was eventually ' admitted ' at about 2 a.m.
jane , wales we seem to forget that the 999 ambulance service is for life threatening emergencies and not a free taxi service or as an alternative to the gp services .
if emergency ambulances are sent to all those who dial 999 who are not emergencies then those with life threatening conditions will have to wait even longer for emergency ambulances and we will have more deaths .
the reason why gps were in ambulance control assessing calls is because there are so many people call the 999 services when it is inappropriate to do so .
there needs to be more public awareness on who to contact and when , phoning 999 for non-emergencies creates this problem and costs lives .
in my three decades of nursing , including working in a & e for many of those , i have seen first hand the misuse of a & e services , the 999 services and the emergency out of hours gp services for situations and conditions that are not emergencies and can be seen by the gp as a routine case .
a high percentage of people attending a & e do n't need to be there , again a high percentage of people arriving at a & e via an ambulance can walk off the ambulance , if you can walk off an ambulance by definition you do not need an emergency ambulance !
again the out of hours gp service is there for emergency and urgent cases and not to be used because you can not see your own gp or have minor symptoms .
by using these services incorrectly this is causing long waiting times in a & e , delaying ambulances going to true emergencies and delaying the out of hours gp from seeing people who need them .
it is easy to blame the a & e 's , gp 's , ambulance service and nhs direct for these problems -lrb- often done by those who do not understand these services or want to jump on the ' bandwagon ' of blame -rrb- when it is due to the public misusing the out of hours and emergency services .

but unlike neighbouring powys council , officials in ceredigion propose turning off lamps in rural areas only between midnight and 0500 gmt .
thousands of lights have been blacked-out across powys as part of a controversial cost-cutting policy , which is saving the council £ 225,000 .
ceredigion 's street light budget is facing a £ 50,000 shortfall .
the county has 6,193 street lights , but the plan is unlikely to affect the towns of aberystwyth , aberaeron , cardigan , lampeter , llandysul , tregaron and new quay .
it is hoped the scheme will save ceredigion between £ 30,000 and £ 45,000 .
' budget settlement ' the council 's highways scrutiny committee met on wednesday to discuss the issue .
councillor lyndon lloyd , who represents beulah ward , near aberporth , which could be blacked-out under the scheme , said : " the committee recommended an option to turn off all lights in rural areas in the short-term and in the long-term invest in more energy efficient lights .
" it could affect villages in my area .
it 's not a happy situation , but if the county council had received a better budget settlement then perhaps it could have maintained the lights . "
mr lloyd said community councils in ceredigion could be allowed to pay to maintain their own lights .
council colleague towyn evans , who represents the rural ward of llandyfriog in south ceredigion , said the planned scheme was regrettable , but a sign of the times .
" any loss of service and people will be unhappy with it , " he added .
" but every council will be looking at making savings . "
ceredigion council 's cabinet is expected to discuss the plans on 25 november .
other welsh councils in torfaen and pembrokeshire are also planning to extinguish street lights .

but unlike neighbouring powys council , officials in ceredigion propose turning off lamps in rural areas only between midnight and 0500 gmt .
thousands of lights have been blacked-out across powys as part of a controversial cost-cutting policy , which is saving the council £ 225,000 .
ceredigion 's street light budget is facing a £ 50,000 shortfall .
the county has 6,193 street lights , but the plan is unlikely to affect the towns of aberystwyth , aberaeron , cardigan , lampeter , llandysul , tregaron and new quay .
it is hoped the scheme will save ceredigion between £ 30,000 and £ 45,000 .
' budget settlement ' the council 's highways scrutiny committee met on wednesday to discuss the issue .
councillor lyndon lloyd , who represents beulah ward , near aberporth , which could be blacked-out under the scheme , said : " the committee recommended an option to turn off all lights in rural areas in the short-term and in the long-term invest in more energy efficient lights .
" it could affect villages in my area .
it 's not a happy situation , but if the county council had received a better budget settlement then perhaps it could have maintained the lights . "
mr lloyd said community councils in ceredigion could be allowed to pay to maintain their own lights .
council colleague towyn evans , who represents the rural ward of llandyfriog in south ceredigion , said the planned scheme was regrettable , but a sign of the times .
" any loss of service and people will be unhappy with it , " he added .
" but every council will be looking at making savings . "
ceredigion council 's cabinet is expected to discuss the plans on 25 november .
other welsh councils in torfaen and pembrokeshire are also planning to extinguish street lights .

hellen bach and norman macintosh , from newport , have produced the cd to raise cash for the bbc appeal .
the pair have also enlisted other radio 2 presenters , including mark radcliffe .
the cd is the latest fundraising item to be sold by the pair on behalf of togs -lrb- terry 's old geezers or gals -rrb- , a group of sir terry 's devoted fans .
after the togs sold a small calendar for children in need in 1999 , ms bach decided to approach sir terry to take the idea further , ready for this year 's appeal on friday , 14 november .
" i went to see sir terry when he was signing books in bournemouth , " she said .
" he said ' yes , if you are mad enough and have got enough time and money then i will support you ' .
so that 's what i did . "
" i went to sir terry and said i had an idea " hellen bach they set up a togs calendar site to sell merchandise and , with the help of fellow togs , have now raised around £ 3.5m for children in need .
a celebrity calendar is still produced every year along with other togs spin-offs including janet and john story cds , clothing and mugs .
last year the couple handed over £ 1.5m to children in need , mainly due to sales of the janet and john cd .
the cd earned ms bach and mr macintosh a gold disc after it sold more than 100,000 copies .
ms bach , who used to work for an insurance company , said : " we gave our jobs up last year to do this full time .
we were working every hour and we 're still not on top of it .
" we get an admin fee for what gets sold but everyone else who works for us is a volunteer . "
' wonderful speech ' the music cd , bandaged , is launched on thursday , features children 's songs including twinkle , twinkle little star and puff the magic dragon .
sir terry and aled jones have teamed up to sing little drummer boy and peace on earth , which ms bach hopes could be a christmas number one .
other songs include the hippopotamus song -lrb- mud , mud , glorious mud -rrb- by sir terry , my brother by radio 2 presenter alex lester and right said fred by mark radcliffe .
" i went to sir terry and said i had an idea .
i said it was time we brought back some children 's songs from years gone by , " said ms bach .
and sir terry , who has also been the bbc 's eurovision commentator since the 1970s , is proud of the efforts of his " old geezers " .
" he came to the -lsb- togs -rsb- convention in leicester in september and did a wonderful speech where he said he ca n't thank us enough for what we do , " said ms bach .

the financial body said it would make $ 4.5bn immediately available as part of the two-year package .
the plan includes " monetary and exchange rate policy shifts , banking recapitalisation and fiscal and incomes policy adjustments " .
the imf has agreed loans to several nations to restore their economies .
hungary and iceland have both reached agreement with the imf over loan deals .
' considerable stress ' the imf has forecast that ukraine will fall into recession next year , with its economic output shrinking by 3 % .
" the ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress , " said imf deputy managing director murilo portugal .
falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook murilo portugal , imf deputy managing director he said said the government plan and the imf loan aimed " to restore financial and macroeconomic stability by adopting a flexible exchange rate regime with targeted intervention " .
the loan for ukraine was finally approved after being agreed at the end of october .
increasing access to credit and a property boom had led to rapid growth in ukraine 's capital kiev , but investors have withdrawn funds following the recent financial turmoil and uncertainty .
ukraine is also heavily reliant on commodities , but prices of these have fallen recently .
" falling prices for ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in ukraine 's current account outlook , " said mr portugal .

the us state department stressed the planned shield in the czech republic and poland was " not aimed at russia " .
nato voiced " serious concerns " about moscow 's intentions .
president dmitry medvedev said putting short-range iskander missiles near nato members poland and lithuania would " neutralise " the us missile shield .
in his state-of-the nation address on wednesday , mr medvedev said russia had been forced to respond to the us plans by deploying missiles in its kaliningrad enclave , between poland and lithuania .
the us has repeatedly stated that its shield is a defence against missiles from " rogue " nations , but russia sees it as a direct threat , correspondents say .
while mr medvedev 's announcement was extremely provocative , the kremlin 's clear message was that america was to blame , the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in moscow says .
russia ' growling ' " the steps that the russian government announced ... are disappointing , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" the missile defence sites in the czech republic and poland are not aimed at russia .
" this missile defence system is designed to protect against rogue states , for example iran , who are working on long-range missile technology . "
mr mccormack also expressed hopes that " one day they -lsb- the russians -rsb- will realise that " .
a nato spokesman said the alliance was concerned about the compatibility of russian plans with existing arms control " arrangements " .
" moreover , placing of these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " nato spokesman robert pszczel told the afp news agency .
lithuanian president valdas adamkus said russia 's decision to deploy missiles was " beyond comprehension " , while czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg described the move as " unfortunate " .
however , polish prime minister donald tusk played down mr medvedev 's announcement .
" we have been used to the fact that russia growls every now and then .

the us state department stressed the planned shield in the czech republic and poland was " not aimed at russia " .
nato voiced " serious concerns " about moscow 's intentions .
president dmitry medvedev said putting short-range iskander missiles near nato members poland and lithuania would " neutralise " the us missile shield .
in his state-of-the nation address on wednesday , mr medvedev said russia had been forced to respond to the us plans by deploying missiles in its kaliningrad enclave , between poland and lithuania .
the us has repeatedly stated that its shield is a defence against missiles from " rogue " nations , but russia sees it as a direct threat , correspondents say .
while mr medvedev 's announcement was extremely provocative , the kremlin 's clear message was that america was to blame , the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in moscow says .
russia ' growling ' " the steps that the russian government announced ... are disappointing , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" the missile defence sites in the czech republic and poland are not aimed at russia .
" this missile defence system is designed to protect against rogue states , for example iran , who are working on long-range missile technology . "
mr mccormack also expressed hopes that " one day they -lsb- the russians -rsb- will realise that " .
a nato spokesman said the alliance was concerned about the compatibility of russian plans with existing arms control " arrangements " .
" moreover , placing of these iskander missiles in the kaliningrad region would not help nato and russia to improve their relationship , " nato spokesman robert pszczel told the afp news agency .
lithuanian president valdas adamkus said russia 's decision to deploy missiles was " beyond comprehension " , while czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg described the move as " unfortunate " .
however , polish prime minister donald tusk played down mr medvedev 's announcement .
" we have been used to the fact that russia growls every now and then .
i would not give too much meaning to this declaration , " he said .

the internet portal 's co-founder and ceo jerry yang made the comment despite the fact yahoo rejected a $ 33 -lrb- £ 21 -rrb- a share offer from microsoft back in may .
mr yang 's suggestion also came hours after google pulled out of an internet advertising partnership with yahoo .
" to this day the best thing for microsoft to do is buy yahoo , " said mr yang .
" i do n't think that is a bad idea at all , at the right price whatever that price is .
we 're willing to sell the company , " he told a packed ballroom at the web 2.0 summit in san francisco .
during the on stage conversation in front of a standing-room only crowd , mr yang was asked why the company did not take the $ 33 a share offered back in the summer .
the company 's share price closed wednesday below $ 14 -lrb- £ 8.80 -rrb- a share .
" they walked away from a public offering and we were ready to negotiate .
we wanted to negotiate a deal .
we felt we were n't that far apart .
" at the end of the day , they withdrew and they have since been clear about not wanting to buy the company , " explained mr yang in a rare public appearance .
microsoft did however come back and offer to buy the search part of yahoo , but a deal was never struck .
again mr yang said the offer then was not good enough but he still remained open to persuasion .
" as far as a search deal goes , we are open-minded about it .
the last time we felt the deal was not a good one for the company but that does n't mean we wo n't do one . "
when asked if any negotiations were pending with the software giant , mr yang said " there is no new news . "
microsoft declined to comment .
and when quizzed about a possible deal with aol , mr yang played coy with his host john battelle .
" buying aol ?
i ca n't talk about that , john .
if i told you i would have to kill you . "
' disappointed ' while yahoo is still holding the door open to microsoft , google closed one earlier in the day on a deal the two companies had struck up over search advertising .
after four months of scrutiny from the department of justice , google decided to back out of the agreement it had made to provide advertising around the internet portal 's search results .
it had been estimated that the venture would have been worth around $ 800m -lrb- £ 500m -rrb- a year to yahoo .
" pressing ahead risked not only a protracted legal battle but also damage to relationships with valued partners , " said google 's chief counsel david drummond .
mr yang said he was " disappointed that they -lsb- google -rsb- did n't want to defend this deal . "
but he felt that in his mind , the government scuppered it .
" i really thought the government in this case does not understand our industry .
they have a market definition that i think is too narrow and i think things like this tend to have unintended consequences for our entire industry .
" so i clearly do n't agree with what the viewpoint is , but they are the government and they can decide on these things . "
mr yang pointed out that the google partnership was not crucial to its bottom line and that it was " incremental " to its overall growth plans .

the grant of £ 330,000 will be used to undertake urgent roof works at bletchley park - where allied codebreakers worked in world war ii .
discussions are also in progress on a further three-year , £ 600,000 funding programme for the historic site .
the donation follows efforts to highlight the dilapidated state of the huts and other buildings at bletchley .
the rooms of the grade ii-listed mansion , replete with painted ceilings , timber panelling , and ornate plasterwork , are at risk because the roof has been patched rather than renovated so many times during the 130 years of the mansion 's history .
the work funded by the grant is projected to finish in march .
' enormous endeavour ' " bletchley park played a fundamental role in the allies winning the second world war and is of great importance to the history of europe , " said dr simon thurley , chief executive of english heritage .
" english heritage is committed to saving this fascinating group of buildings so that future generations can understand something of the enormous human endeavour which went on there . "
in july about 100 uk academics signed a letter to the times condemning the neglect of bletchley .
the bletchley park trust has raised more than £ 5m since taking over the site in 1992 .
it is in ongoing talks with english heritage , as well as the milton keynes borough council , to raise a further £ 600,000 .
english heritage has pledged £ 100,000 a year for the next three years if its partners in the deal can match those funds .
the sum would be put toward a rolling programme to restore the huts that housed the world war ii codebreakers who cracked many of the codes used by the german .
the cash from english heritage follows a donation by hi-tech firms ibm and pgp to the national museum of computing which shares the bletchley site .
