program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.12.2008 brussels approves european bank rescue packages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb was germany 's first casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis the eu 's executive on tuesday approved a raft of member-state plans to prop up their ailing financial institutions , including germany ’ s ikb and nordlb , two of the country ’ s banks worst hit by the financial crisis . the german plan to guarantee the two banks ' business is " necessary to avoid a serious disturbance in the german economy , " the european commission said in a statement .
the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2008 ibisevic , hoffenheim lead bundesliga top eleven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has had hoffenheim celebrating all season with plenty of players performing well , it was difficult for dw-world to single out the individuals who made the biggest difference in the first half of the season .
one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 23.12.2008 " total sanitation " for india – are alternative toilets a solution ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man demonstrating an " ecosan " toilet in thergaon , maharashtra the un declared 2008 the " international year of sanitation " .
the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "
it is possible to change minds , but it takes time .
the indian government has only just started to promote alternative toilets . thomas bärthlein 23/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic us japan drills us-japanese military drills have begun in the sea of japan as the region seethes with conflict .

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .
and it left latvia extremely vulnerable to the shocks of the current financial crisis .
in recent months the economy has gone into reverse , with analysts predicting a severe recession and rumors of an impending devaluation of the national currency , the lats , sweeping the country .

scores of vessels chugging through the gulf of aden or rounding the horn of africa this year have been attacked by somali pirates this year .
pirates seized more than 200 ships this year alone - often kidnapping crews - and demanding millions of dollars in ransom .
the sharp rise in piracy in the waters off somalia has forced both the eu and the us to rush their navies to the area to protect merchant shipping .
no " guantanamo on the sea " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung visited the german navy in djibouti this week since many of the pirates come from somalia , which has been without a working government since the overthrow of military dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 , german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that he believed suspected pirates should face an international court .
" it needs to be an international authority .
no one wants a ' guantanamo on the sea ' , " jung told reporters in djibouti , where he saw off 220 german troops joining the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- anti-piracy mission known as " atalanta " .
german lawmakers agreed last week to send up to 1,400 soldiers and a frigate - the karlsruhe - to the gulf of aden as part of the eu mission .
the mandate allows for pirates to be captured if necessary , and they could be kept on board temporarily before possibly being put on trial in africa .
there have been around 95 pirate attacks in somali waters this year .
nearly 400 people and 19 ships are currently being held along the somali coast , including a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million worth of oil .
in october , french forces captured nine suspected pirates at sea and handed them over to somali security forces . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "

vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .

munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .

this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .

schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .

honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.12.2008 germany stockpiles natural gas as dispute with russia heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine says it has enough reserves to keep supplying europe germany has kept its stores of natural gas full as it warily follows a new year-end dispute between russia and ukraine .
at the same time , russia is warning that the era of cheap gas is coming to an end . germany 's economics ministry spokeswoman said gas distributors had assured berlin there would be no shortages in germany because of the dispute .
" the storage is pretty full , " she said on tuesday , dec .
23 , referring to the rock formations into which germany injects vast quantities of siberian natural gas so that it has gas to heat buildings and run factories through the winter .
russia could cut supplies the russian gas-export monopoly , gazprom , and the russian government have warned european consumers of possible disruptions in supplies pumped through ukrainian territory at the start of 2009 .
gazprom is threatening cuts to kiev over a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.8 billion euro -rrb- debt russia says ukraine 's state gas company naftogaz owes gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily dependent on natural gas from siberia ukraine claims it only owes $ 814 million .
russia wants ukraine to pay its debt by discounting transit fees in 2009 .
" so far , no solution has been found because of the non-constructive position of the ukrainian party , " russian first deputy prime minister and gazprom chairman viktor zubkov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying on monday .
russia has also warned that prices could go up in the new year .
ukraine currently pays russia $ 179.5 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas but that could jump to $ 400 for 1,000 cubic meters starting next year .
ukraine believes it should pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas in 2009 , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko 's press secretary said last week .
russia could cut supplies about 80 percent of russian gas exports to western europe use pipelines across ukrainian territory .
a breakdown in a similar gas pricing dispute between gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz at the start of 2006 led to fuel shortages and a price spike across europe in the dead of winter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia expects a steep increase in gas prices for 2009 in recent weeks , ukraine accumulated more than 16 billion cubic meters of gas in underground reservoirs , sufficient to cover ukrainian gas needs well into 2009 , said oleksander shlapak , a senior spokesman for president viktor yushchenko .
" we give a full guarantee of continued gas deliveries -lrb- to europe -rrb- , " shlapak said .
" but if there is a cut-off -lrb- by russia -rrb- we are prepared to cover our needs from reservoir reserves . "

at the same time , russia is warning that the era of cheap gas is coming to an end . germany 's economics ministry spokeswoman said gas distributors had assured berlin there would be no shortages in germany because of the dispute .
" the storage is pretty full , " she said on tuesday , dec .
23 , referring to the rock formations into which germany injects vast quantities of siberian natural gas so that it has gas to heat buildings and run factories through the winter .
russia could cut supplies the russian gas-export monopoly , gazprom , and the russian government have warned european consumers of possible disruptions in supplies pumped through ukrainian territory at the start of 2009 .
gazprom is threatening cuts to kiev over a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.8 billion euro -rrb- debt russia says ukraine 's state gas company naftogaz owes gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily dependent on natural gas from siberia ukraine claims it only owes $ 814 million .
russia wants ukraine to pay its debt by discounting transit fees in 2009 .
" so far , no solution has been found because of the non-constructive position of the ukrainian party , " russian first deputy prime minister and gazprom chairman viktor zubkov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying on monday .
russia has also warned that prices could go up in the new year .
ukraine currently pays russia $ 179.5 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas but that could jump to $ 400 for 1,000 cubic meters starting next year .
ukraine believes it should pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas in 2009 , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko 's press secretary said last week .
russia could cut supplies about 80 percent of russian gas exports to western europe use pipelines across ukrainian territory .
a breakdown in a similar gas pricing dispute between gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz at the start of 2006 led to fuel shortages and a price spike across europe in the dead of winter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia expects a steep increase in gas prices for 2009 in recent weeks , ukraine accumulated more than 16 billion cubic meters of gas in underground reservoirs , sufficient to cover ukrainian gas needs well into 2009 , said oleksander shlapak , a senior spokesman for president viktor yushchenko .
" we give a full guarantee of continued gas deliveries -lrb- to europe -rrb- , " shlapak said .
" but if there is a cut-off -lrb- by russia -rrb- we are prepared to cover our needs from reservoir reserves . "
ukraine has been hard hit by the global financial crisis , with its economy shrinking 14.4 percent in the past year .
since september , ukraine 's currency , the hryvnia , has lost about half of its value compared with the dollar .
the imf made a $ 16.4 billion loan to ukraine in november to help recapitalize banks and get the country through the current financial crisis .
putin : say goodbye to cheap gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin expects prices to rise over the long term russian prime minister vladimir putin , speaking at the gas exporting countries forum -lrb- gecf -rrb- on tuesday , said that the era of cheap gas prices was ending .
" the expenses necessary for developing fields are rising sharply , and this means that despite the current problems in finances the era of cheap energy resources , of cheap gas , is of course coming to an end , " putin said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "

sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .

euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .

euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2008 ibisevic , hoffenheim lead bundesliga top eleven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has had hoffenheim celebrating all season with plenty of players performing well , it was difficult for dw-world to single out the individuals who made the biggest difference in the first half of the season .
one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .

euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2008 ibisevic , hoffenheim lead bundesliga top eleven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has had hoffenheim celebrating all season with plenty of players performing well , it was difficult for dw-world to single out the individuals who made the biggest difference in the first half of the season .
one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.12.2008 eu calls for peaceful transition in guinea after leader 's death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the parliament building in guinea the european union has called on guinea ’ s military and government to ensure a peaceful leadership transition after the death of the west african nation ’ s long-term leader sparked reports of a military coup tuesday . a military radio statement within hours of the death of president lansana conte said that both the government and the constitution had been suspended .
army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .

" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .

vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .

our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .
and it left latvia extremely vulnerable to the shocks of the current financial crisis .
in recent months the economy has gone into reverse , with analysts predicting a severe recession and rumors of an impending devaluation of the national currency , the lats , sweeping the country .

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .
and it left latvia extremely vulnerable to the shocks of the current financial crisis .
in recent months the economy has gone into reverse , with analysts predicting a severe recession and rumors of an impending devaluation of the national currency , the lats , sweeping the country .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .

nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .

under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .

deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia could cut supplies the russian gas-export monopoly , gazprom , and the russian government have warned european consumers of possible disruptions in supplies pumped through ukrainian territory at the start of 2009 .
gazprom is threatening cuts to kiev over a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.8 billion euro -rrb- debt russia says ukraine 's state gas company naftogaz owes gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily dependent on natural gas from siberia ukraine claims it only owes $ 814 million .
russia wants ukraine to pay its debt by discounting transit fees in 2009 .
" so far , no solution has been found because of the non-constructive position of the ukrainian party , " russian first deputy prime minister and gazprom chairman viktor zubkov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying on monday .
russia has also warned that prices could go up in the new year .
ukraine currently pays russia $ 179.5 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas but that could jump to $ 400 for 1,000 cubic meters starting next year .
ukraine believes it should pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas in 2009 , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko 's press secretary said last week .
russia could cut supplies about 80 percent of russian gas exports to western europe use pipelines across ukrainian territory .
a breakdown in a similar gas pricing dispute between gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz at the start of 2006 led to fuel shortages and a price spike across europe in the dead of winter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia expects a steep increase in gas prices for 2009 in recent weeks , ukraine accumulated more than 16 billion cubic meters of gas in underground reservoirs , sufficient to cover ukrainian gas needs well into 2009 , said oleksander shlapak , a senior spokesman for president viktor yushchenko .
" we give a full guarantee of continued gas deliveries -lrb- to europe -rrb- , " shlapak said .
" but if there is a cut-off -lrb- by russia -rrb- we are prepared to cover our needs from reservoir reserves . "
ukraine has been hard hit by the global financial crisis , with its economy shrinking 14.4 percent in the past year .
since september , ukraine 's currency , the hryvnia , has lost about half of its value compared with the dollar .
the imf made a $ 16.4 billion loan to ukraine in november to help recapitalize banks and get the country through the current financial crisis .

scores of vessels chugging through the gulf of aden or rounding the horn of africa this year have been attacked by somali pirates this year .
pirates seized more than 200 ships this year alone - often kidnapping crews - and demanding millions of dollars in ransom .
the sharp rise in piracy in the waters off somalia has forced both the eu and the us to rush their navies to the area to protect merchant shipping .
no " guantanamo on the sea " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung visited the german navy in djibouti this week since many of the pirates come from somalia , which has been without a working government since the overthrow of military dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 , german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that he believed suspected pirates should face an international court .
" it needs to be an international authority .
no one wants a ' guantanamo on the sea ' , " jung told reporters in djibouti , where he saw off 220 german troops joining the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- anti-piracy mission known as " atalanta " .
german lawmakers agreed last week to send up to 1,400 soldiers and a frigate - the karlsruhe - to the gulf of aden as part of the eu mission .
the mandate allows for pirates to be captured if necessary , and they could be kept on board temporarily before possibly being put on trial in africa .
there have been around 95 pirate attacks in somali waters this year .
nearly 400 people and 19 ships are currently being held along the somali coast , including a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million worth of oil .
in october , french forces captured nine suspected pirates at sea and handed them over to somali security forces . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .
and it left latvia extremely vulnerable to the shocks of the current financial crisis .
in recent months the economy has gone into reverse , with analysts predicting a severe recession and rumors of an impending devaluation of the national currency , the lats , sweeping the country .

scores of vessels chugging through the gulf of aden or rounding the horn of africa this year have been attacked by somali pirates this year .
pirates seized more than 200 ships this year alone - often kidnapping crews - and demanding millions of dollars in ransom .
the sharp rise in piracy in the waters off somalia has forced both the eu and the us to rush their navies to the area to protect merchant shipping .
no " guantanamo on the sea " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung visited the german navy in djibouti this week since many of the pirates come from somalia , which has been without a working government since the overthrow of military dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 , german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that he believed suspected pirates should face an international court .
" it needs to be an international authority .
no one wants a ' guantanamo on the sea ' , " jung told reporters in djibouti , where he saw off 220 german troops joining the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- anti-piracy mission known as " atalanta " .
german lawmakers agreed last week to send up to 1,400 soldiers and a frigate - the karlsruhe - to the gulf of aden as part of the eu mission .
the mandate allows for pirates to be captured if necessary , and they could be kept on board temporarily before possibly being put on trial in africa .
there have been around 95 pirate attacks in somali waters this year .
nearly 400 people and 19 ships are currently being held along the somali coast , including a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million worth of oil .
in october , french forces captured nine suspected pirates at sea and handed them over to somali security forces . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is suspected of either overseeing or calling for multiple murders in both 1990 and 1994 .
" in particular , he is accused of involvement in a massacre at nyarubuye in mid-april 1994 in the course of which several thousand people were killed , " said a statement in karlsruhe , where the federal prosecutors are based .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between berlin and kigali have grown frosty the prosecutors said the separate german inquiry began in march this year after rwanda had requested his arrest in germany .
he was initially detained on april 23 in frankfurt but released november 3 after german judges ruled against his extradition , citing a ruling by the international tribunal on rwanda which is based in the tanzanian city of arusha .
german law allows trials for crimes abroad provided the accused is a german resident or the victims are german .
second arrest in as many months last month , a senior tutsi politician , rose kabuye , was arrested on a french warrant after landing in germany .
though she was later extradited to france , the arrest has strained ties between kigali and berlin .
rwanda strongly condemned the move , arguing that kabuye was on official state business and therefore merited diplomatic immunity .
the country expelled the german ambassador and recalled its envoy from berlin .
kabuye was accused of being an accessory in the assassination of hutu president juvenal habyarimana in 1994 , an event that is blamed for triggering the genocide of 800,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye , shown here in 1997 with madeline albright , was arrested last month it has been debated whether tutsi rebels shot down the plane or hutu militants stage-managed the assassination as a provocation .

news reports in paris tuesday said she has been freed on bail and was allowed to fly home to rwanda for christmas , but is required to reappear before a judge in france on january 10 . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

army captain moussa dadis camara said a council of civilian and military leaders would be set up to replace the government as state institutions were " incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country , " the bbc reported .
" in the next few days , a transitional consultative council will be set up made up of soldiers and civilians taking account of ethnic balance .
it will be led by a president , " camara said .
but guinean prime minister ahmed tidiane souare later dispelled those claims , saying the government and state institutions had not been dissolved and that plans were being made for conte 's funeral .
" i do not know these people who have spoken .
we are trying to settle this question of national importance , " he said .
" i am sure that they will see reason .
they have not used force .
there has been no threat against anybody . "
souare said on radio france internationale that most soldiers in the guinean military remained loyal to the country 's constitution and asked them to resist any attempted coup .
the circumstances surrounding conte 's death are not yet available , but he was known to suffer from diabetes and was a heavy smoker .
conjecture surrounded his exact date of birth , but he was believed to have been 74 when he died .
eu calls for calm transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lansana conte of guinea had seized power in 1984 a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the eu was keeping up with developments in guinea and urged all european residents to remain in their homes until the situation deescalated .
the eu called on political and army leaders to " respect constitutional measures to ensure a peaceful transition " of power through elections .
national assembly president aboubacar sompare announced conte 's death on state television in the early hours of tuesday , asking guinea 's supreme court to officially declare the presidency vacant so a presidential election could be held within 60 days , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
sompare was expected to be named interim president in line with the constitution , despite the army 's announcement that it would hand-pick a military president in the coming days .
the streets of the capital conakry were said to be quiet with no visible troop presence following reports of conte 's death and possible coup .
lack of successor conte seized control of guinea in a bloodless coup in 1984 and maintained a tight grip on the nation through three controversial elections until his death late monday , dec .
22 .
in recent years , the nation has seen a military mutiny , anti-government riots and strikes over the rising cost of food and fuel .
conte did not groom a successor and his death prompted fears that the military would make a move to fill the power vacuum .
rumours that his health had deteriorated had been circulating since last week , but officials had denied the reports . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .

but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .

once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .

shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .
the little children , too , use the toilet .
my mother-in-law found it a little strange at first .
she said : this gives me a pain in the belly ! i was really angry with her .
and she used to sit angrily on the toilet .
but now she likes it , " shobha laughs .
is ecological sanitation an alternative ?
but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?
so we need to start promoting ecological sanitation at this stage !
otherwise it will take another campaign to convert these water-flush systems to some sort of water efficient or dry toilet system . "
there are different models of sustainable sanitation .
they are based on collecting urine and faeces and re-using them locally , either as manure in agriculture or for producing biogas .
other countries have progressed further than india in this field .
china has already installed more than a million sustainable or " ecosan " toilets .
hampered by taboos in india , on the other hand , there are only small initiatives so far .
taboos and psychological inhibitions against the use of human faeces are widespread .
dr. subhas vithal mapuskar introduced ecosan toilets for biogas production in a village near pune some decades ago .
he remembers : " initially , they started using that gas for getting hot water .
once they started using it for hot water , their first impression about the dirtiness of that gas disappeared .
and then , gradually , they themselves didn ’ t know when that hot water bucket remained aside and the pressure cooker got on the gas burner . "
it is possible to change minds , but it takes time .
the indian government has only just started to promote alternative toilets . thomas bärthlein 23/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media fukushima human error a report for the iaea points to human error as the cause of japan 's worst nuclear disaster .

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .

at the same time , russia is warning that the era of cheap gas is coming to an end . germany 's economics ministry spokeswoman said gas distributors had assured berlin there would be no shortages in germany because of the dispute .
" the storage is pretty full , " she said on tuesday , dec .
23 , referring to the rock formations into which germany injects vast quantities of siberian natural gas so that it has gas to heat buildings and run factories through the winter .
russia could cut supplies the russian gas-export monopoly , gazprom , and the russian government have warned european consumers of possible disruptions in supplies pumped through ukrainian territory at the start of 2009 .
gazprom is threatening cuts to kiev over a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.8 billion euro -rrb- debt russia says ukraine 's state gas company naftogaz owes gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily dependent on natural gas from siberia ukraine claims it only owes $ 814 million .
russia wants ukraine to pay its debt by discounting transit fees in 2009 .
" so far , no solution has been found because of the non-constructive position of the ukrainian party , " russian first deputy prime minister and gazprom chairman viktor zubkov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying on monday .
russia has also warned that prices could go up in the new year .
ukraine currently pays russia $ 179.5 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas but that could jump to $ 400 for 1,000 cubic meters starting next year .
ukraine believes it should pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas in 2009 , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko 's press secretary said last week .
russia could cut supplies about 80 percent of russian gas exports to western europe use pipelines across ukrainian territory .
a breakdown in a similar gas pricing dispute between gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz at the start of 2006 led to fuel shortages and a price spike across europe in the dead of winter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia expects a steep increase in gas prices for 2009 in recent weeks , ukraine accumulated more than 16 billion cubic meters of gas in underground reservoirs , sufficient to cover ukrainian gas needs well into 2009 , said oleksander shlapak , a senior spokesman for president viktor yushchenko .
" we give a full guarantee of continued gas deliveries -lrb- to europe -rrb- , " shlapak said .
" but if there is a cut-off -lrb- by russia -rrb- we are prepared to cover our needs from reservoir reserves . "
ukraine has been hard hit by the global financial crisis , with its economy shrinking 14.4 percent in the past year .
since september , ukraine 's currency , the hryvnia , has lost about half of its value compared with the dollar .
the imf made a $ 16.4 billion loan to ukraine in november to help recapitalize banks and get the country through the current financial crisis .

at the same time , russia is warning that the era of cheap gas is coming to an end . germany 's economics ministry spokeswoman said gas distributors had assured berlin there would be no shortages in germany because of the dispute .
" the storage is pretty full , " she said on tuesday , dec .
23 , referring to the rock formations into which germany injects vast quantities of siberian natural gas so that it has gas to heat buildings and run factories through the winter .
russia could cut supplies the russian gas-export monopoly , gazprom , and the russian government have warned european consumers of possible disruptions in supplies pumped through ukrainian territory at the start of 2009 .
gazprom is threatening cuts to kiev over a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.8 billion euro -rrb- debt russia says ukraine 's state gas company naftogaz owes gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily dependent on natural gas from siberia ukraine claims it only owes $ 814 million .
russia wants ukraine to pay its debt by discounting transit fees in 2009 .
" so far , no solution has been found because of the non-constructive position of the ukrainian party , " russian first deputy prime minister and gazprom chairman viktor zubkov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying on monday .
russia has also warned that prices could go up in the new year .
ukraine currently pays russia $ 179.5 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas but that could jump to $ 400 for 1,000 cubic meters starting next year .
ukraine believes it should pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas in 2009 , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko 's press secretary said last week .
russia could cut supplies about 80 percent of russian gas exports to western europe use pipelines across ukrainian territory .
a breakdown in a similar gas pricing dispute between gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz at the start of 2006 led to fuel shortages and a price spike across europe in the dead of winter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia expects a steep increase in gas prices for 2009 in recent weeks , ukraine accumulated more than 16 billion cubic meters of gas in underground reservoirs , sufficient to cover ukrainian gas needs well into 2009 , said oleksander shlapak , a senior spokesman for president viktor yushchenko .
" we give a full guarantee of continued gas deliveries -lrb- to europe -rrb- , " shlapak said .
" but if there is a cut-off -lrb- by russia -rrb- we are prepared to cover our needs from reservoir reserves . "
ukraine has been hard hit by the global financial crisis , with its economy shrinking 14.4 percent in the past year .
since september , ukraine 's currency , the hryvnia , has lost about half of its value compared with the dollar .
the imf made a $ 16.4 billion loan to ukraine in november to help recapitalize banks and get the country through the current financial crisis .
putin : say goodbye to cheap gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin expects prices to rise over the long term russian prime minister vladimir putin , speaking at the gas exporting countries forum -lrb- gecf -rrb- on tuesday , said that the era of cheap gas prices was ending .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2008 ibisevic , hoffenheim lead bundesliga top eleven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has had hoffenheim celebrating all season with plenty of players performing well , it was difficult for dw-world to single out the individuals who made the biggest difference in the first half of the season .
one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .

the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .

euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .

at the same time , russia is warning that the era of cheap gas is coming to an end . germany 's economics ministry spokeswoman said gas distributors had assured berlin there would be no shortages in germany because of the dispute .
" the storage is pretty full , " she said on tuesday , dec .
23 , referring to the rock formations into which germany injects vast quantities of siberian natural gas so that it has gas to heat buildings and run factories through the winter .
russia could cut supplies the russian gas-export monopoly , gazprom , and the russian government have warned european consumers of possible disruptions in supplies pumped through ukrainian territory at the start of 2009 .
gazprom is threatening cuts to kiev over a $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.8 billion euro -rrb- debt russia says ukraine 's state gas company naftogaz owes gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily dependent on natural gas from siberia ukraine claims it only owes $ 814 million .
russia wants ukraine to pay its debt by discounting transit fees in 2009 .
" so far , no solution has been found because of the non-constructive position of the ukrainian party , " russian first deputy prime minister and gazprom chairman viktor zubkov was quoted by news agency interfax as saying on monday .
russia has also warned that prices could go up in the new year .
ukraine currently pays russia $ 179.5 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas but that could jump to $ 400 for 1,000 cubic meters starting next year .
ukraine believes it should pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas in 2009 , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko 's press secretary said last week .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .
and it left latvia extremely vulnerable to the shocks of the current financial crisis .
in recent months the economy has gone into reverse , with analysts predicting a severe recession and rumors of an impending devaluation of the national currency , the lats , sweeping the country .

one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .

one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .

scores of vessels chugging through the gulf of aden or rounding the horn of africa this year have been attacked by somali pirates this year .
pirates seized more than 200 ships this year alone - often kidnapping crews - and demanding millions of dollars in ransom .
the sharp rise in piracy in the waters off somalia has forced both the eu and the us to rush their navies to the area to protect merchant shipping .
no " guantanamo on the sea " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung visited the german navy in djibouti this week since many of the pirates come from somalia , which has been without a working government since the overthrow of military dictator mohamed siad barre in 1991 , german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that he believed suspected pirates should face an international court .
" it needs to be an international authority .
no one wants a ' guantanamo on the sea ' , " jung told reporters in djibouti , where he saw off 220 german troops joining the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- anti-piracy mission known as " atalanta " .
german lawmakers agreed last week to send up to 1,400 soldiers and a frigate - the karlsruhe - to the gulf of aden as part of the eu mission .
the mandate allows for pirates to be captured if necessary , and they could be kept on board temporarily before possibly being put on trial in africa .
there have been around 95 pirate attacks in somali waters this year .
nearly 400 people and 19 ships are currently being held along the somali coast , including a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million worth of oil .
in october , french forces captured nine suspected pirates at sea and handed them over to somali security forces . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2008 ibisevic , hoffenheim lead bundesliga top eleven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has had hoffenheim celebrating all season with plenty of players performing well , it was difficult for dw-world to single out the individuals who made the biggest difference in the first half of the season .
one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

he is suspected of either overseeing or calling for multiple murders in both 1990 and 1994 .
" in particular , he is accused of involvement in a massacre at nyarubuye in mid-april 1994 in the course of which several thousand people were killed , " said a statement in karlsruhe , where the federal prosecutors are based .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between berlin and kigali have grown frosty the prosecutors said the separate german inquiry began in march this year after rwanda had requested his arrest in germany .
he was initially detained on april 23 in frankfurt but released november 3 after german judges ruled against his extradition , citing a ruling by the international tribunal on rwanda which is based in the tanzanian city of arusha .
german law allows trials for crimes abroad provided the accused is a german resident or the victims are german .
second arrest in as many months last month , a senior tutsi politician , rose kabuye , was arrested on a french warrant after landing in germany .
though she was later extradited to france , the arrest has strained ties between kigali and berlin .
rwanda strongly condemned the move , arguing that kabuye was on official state business and therefore merited diplomatic immunity .
the country expelled the german ambassador and recalled its envoy from berlin .
kabuye was accused of being an accessory in the assassination of hutu president juvenal habyarimana in 1994 , an event that is blamed for triggering the genocide of 800,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye , shown here in 1997 with madeline albright , was arrested last month it has been debated whether tutsi rebels shot down the plane or hutu militants stage-managed the assassination as a provocation .
kabuye 's arrest has likewise worsened the relationship between kigali and paris .
news reports in paris tuesday said she has been freed on bail and was allowed to fly home to rwanda for christmas , but is required to reappear before a judge in france on january 10 . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2008 ibisevic , hoffenheim lead bundesliga top eleven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has had hoffenheim celebrating all season with plenty of players performing well , it was difficult for dw-world to single out the individuals who made the biggest difference in the first half of the season .
one pick , however , was blindingly obvious . strikers there are no-brainers , and then there are no-no-no-brainers .
vedad ibisevic is one of the latter .
not only do his 18 goals put him on track to challenge gert mueller 's single-season scoring record , he has 7 assists to boot .
the bosnian is the league 's clear mvp thus far and the biggest reason hoffenheim are the surprise table-toppers .
our second striker may be something of a surprise : bielefeld 's artur wichniarek .
others have scored more often , but the pole 's 10 goals have come for a defensively oriented , bottom-of-the-table team .
and they were potential life-saver as well .
without them bielefeld would be on a measly seven points .
honorable mentions : ba -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , grafite -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , helmes -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , petric -lrb- hamburg -rrb- midfielders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god only knows where bayern would be without ribery his dominance may not show up in the individual statistics , but if you 're looking for the one top playmaker in the league , bayern 's frank ribery is your man .
munich began a mediocre 2-3-2 with the frenchman injured .
since he 's been back in the starting line-up , bayern are undefeated and tied on points at the top of the league .
wolfsburg have disappointed expectations somewhat , but zvjezdan misimovic ca n't be faulted for that .
in his first season for his new club , he 's played in every bundesliga match , scoring 5 goals and assisting on 10 others .
the only way he could top that would be to teach his teammates how to win away from home .
free kicks are an art form , and the midfielder opposing defenses least want to see lining up for them is hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic .
with 4 goals and 8 assists , he 's become the league 's leading specialist in this area , and he 's also developed into a fine one-on-one player , capable of winning balls and kick-starting hoffenheim 's high-octane attack .
hertha berlin 's cicero is another battler who seems to be everywhere on the pitch at one time .
in his first season in germany , he 's become a mainstay , playing all but 21 minutes of hertha 's league games .
he 's also an offensive threat , having scored five goals , most of them on headers after sneaking into opponents ' penalty areas .
honorable mentions : augusto -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , kacar -lrb- hertha -rrb- , eduardo -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , khedira -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the frenchman was stymied by hoffenheim youngster andreas beck at the back , we 'll start with hoffenheim 's andreas beck .
the 21-year-old was the league leaders ' only major addition this season , but if there were any questions that he 's headed for a very bright future , he answered them in hoffenheim 's match against bayern , in which he tied no less than ribery into frustrated knots .
last year dortmund had one of the worst defenses in the league .
this season , they 're second best , and much of the credit must go to neven subotic who 's come up big in the middle .
subotic can also get up the field .
he 's scored 5 goals – not shabby for a central defender – and two of them have been game winners .
schalke have disappointed , but that 's down to their inability to convert chances .
the royal blues still have the league 's best defense , and the heart of their back four is marcelo bordon .
if schalke do manage to recover and challenge at top , they can thank their big man in the middle .
bayern 's philipp lahm has been hampered by injuries , but there 's no overlooking his value to the defending champions .
the goal he scored against hoffenheim got bayern back into that crucial match , and he 's the one player in the league who consistently attracts the attention of top clubs like real madrid and manchester united .
honorable mentions : simunic -lrb- hertha -rrb- , compper -lrb- hoffenheim -rrb- , lucio -lrb- bayern -rrb- , ze roberto -lrb- bayern -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been the man between posts goal hertha 's jaroslav drobny is anything but the prototype of the modern , offensive goalkeeper .
but he 's stopped a higher percentage of shots than anyone in the league , and his performances against a number of foes have secured berlin wins in games they probably should have lost .
without him , berlin would be nowhere near the top three .

the 52-year-old had to undergo emergency surgery but survived . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior public prosecutor helmut walch announces the release of the munich couple the attack raised fears in germany of neo-nazis resorting to violence , but the assailant , who yelled rightist abuse , has not been caught .
so far four suspects have been detained , but all of them have been released . mannichl unable to identify suspects in passau , a police spokesman said a 33-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman from munich had been under suspicion as accessories , but no evidence had been found against them or any of their neo-nazi friends .
earlier , two passau rightists were held , but released after mannichl was shown their photographs . he said neither was the assailant .
since then wanted posters have been issued , using drawings of two men from mannichl 's descriptions . those drawings show men with unusual tattoos on their scalps , but police say they have no firm evidence of the assailant 's identity .
police say it is possible the drawings show one and the same man . candlelight vigil against neo-nazis on monday evening , 500 people gathered in the rain on the market square of fuerstenzell , the passau suburb where mannichl lives , for a candlelight vigil to denounce neo-nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannichl is known for his strong stand against right-wing extremism leaving hospital last week , mannichl said he would not be intimidated and vowed to continue fighting right-wing extremists .

mannichl ordered the grave dug up to seize the flag as evidence . one of germany 's police unions , dpg , appealed tuesday for 500 extra police to be hired to " patrol " the internet and trawl neo-nazi web sites to uncover neo-nazi intentions and gather evidence of hate speech . dpa news agency -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .

the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .

" an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound .

but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .

kovacic then administered strong painkillers to sanders , who had been paralyzed since an accident in 2002 and could not breathe unaided .
sanders died minutes later .
schoenle was charged with manslaughter , while kovacic was tried for being an accessory to manslaughter and grievous bodily harm after he disregarded warning alerts from sanders ' room and provided the pain killers .
" the court found that the doctors behaved correctly both ethically and medically , " a court spokeswoman said following the ruling that found that sanders had already been terminally ill when his life was ended .
prosecutors said sanders ' brother , paul , had switched off the life support equipment " with the knowledge of the chief doctor and the ward physician " and the consent of the rest of the sanders family .
euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

euthanasia debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger kusch assisted the suicide of 79-year-old bettina schardt in wuerzburg , bavaria .
the euthanasia question has been subject to heated public debate over recent months , with german politicians , church leaders and social workers taking a stand against former hamburg justice minister and euthanasia advocate roger kusch .
kusch advertizes himself as a " suicide counselor , " providing advice and support for those seeking to die , such as a 79-year-old wurzburg woman who chose to end her own life late june despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
non-active euthanasia - such as turning off hospital equipment - is not illegal in germany if the patient consents to the act .
nonetheless , german politicians are considering closing what they see as a legal loophole .
in july , the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , called for " organized assisted suicide " or " commercialized assisted suicide , " as practiced by kusch , to be outlawed .
the lower house , the bundestag , is still mulling the legal and ethical implications of the issue .
in the eu , the practice has been legalized in the netherlands and belgium , while french law regulates the " right to die , " which empowers the terminally ill to refuse life-extending treatments . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scores of vessels chugging through the gulf of aden or rounding the horn of africa this year have been attacked by somali pirates this year .
pirates seized more than 200 ships this year alone - often kidnapping crews - and demanding millions of dollars in ransom .

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .
and the major achievement has been done in the last eight years . "
a success story at this pace , india is likely to achieve ‘ total sanitation ’ by 2015 .
the current campaign differs from previous ones in that it focuses on raising people 's awareness and involves the local population .
shobha yadav , a landless labourer lives in a village in the western state of maharashtra .
her family constructed a toilet two years ago . „ when it rained , it used to be really difficult to go out " , she remembers .
" hands and feet used to get dirty in the mud .
now we don ’ t have these problems any more .

the aim was to chalk out a strategy on how to improve sanitation , as more than 2 billion people around the world have no access to proper toilets .
india has the largest number of people without sanitation facilities .
though some progress has been made towards achieving " total sanitation " in india , the country 's water shortage poses new challenges . about 600 million people , half of the indian population , have no access to proper sanitation .
the majority of them live in rural areas .
it normally means they have to go for open defecation in the fields - or along the railway tracks , for example .
since the government launched its " total sanitation campaign " a few years ago , things have begun to change , though .
prakash kumar , a consultant and sanitation expert with unicef , says : " in 1984 , only 8 % of the rural population in india had access to sanitation .
now it has grown to 32 % in 2008 .
but the total sanitation campaign in fact effectively started from 2000 .

but prakash kumar hints at another problem - the shortage of water in large parts of india : „ sometimes i tell my colleagues at unicef and the government of india it is a blessing in disguise that 600 million people are using open defecation " , he says .
" see the consequences : by 2015 , close to 1.2 billion people in india start to use conventional toilets .
all these conventional toilets need water .
from where will the water come ?

there are different models of sustainable sanitation .

the plan will attempt to ensure that neither ikb nor nordlb can benefit from an unfair commercial advantage gained through the assistance package , the commission added .
under the german scheme , ikb will receive a state guarantee covering up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- worth of debt in a bid to guarantee the bank 's ability to refinance its business in the midst of the global credit crunch .
nordlb , which was also hit hard by the worldwide freezing up of credit markets , is to receive a state guarantee which is to run for up to five years and is backed by a " very good , diversified guarantee pool of assets , " the commission statement said .
the commission is tasked with making sure that member states do not break the bloc 's strict rules on fair competition when they move to prop up key businesses or industries .
spanish , italian packages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of spain 's governor warned of total financial meltdown the commission also approved a spanish state guarantee for inter-bank lending valued at up to 200 billion euros , officials confirmed . the scheme has an initial ceiling of 100 billion euros , but this can be doubled " if market conditions request it , " the commission said , adding that the package was an " adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the spanish economy . " an italian scheme for bailing out troubled banks valued at up to 20 billion euros was also approved tuesday , allowing that country 's government to buy into banks unable to weather the global financial crisis .
the decision , which was taken after " intensive " negotiations with the italian government , allows rome to deploy " around 15 to 20 billion euros " to bail out troubled lenders , but only if they can prove that they are " fundamentally sound . " latvian bank aid a latvian government plan to support its banks was also approved tuesday .
latvia has emerged as one of the european countries most affected by the global economic slowdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times could lie ahead for latvia if a deep recession eventuates the plan , worth up to 10 percent of latvia 's total economic output and set to last for six months , allows riga to take over distressed banks and gives sweeping guarantees on loans and deposits in a bid to stabilize the country 's jittery financial sector .
but , like the german plan , the latvian package is bound by strict commission rules on how and when the government could use those rights so as to avoid handing banks an unfair commercial advantage .
the commission " therefore concluded that the scheme was an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the latvian economy , " a separate commission statement said .
deep recession ahead since latvia joined the eu in 2004 , its small , lightly regulated economy has consistently recorded both the highest growth rates and the highest inflation in the bloc .
that growth was principally fuelled by domestic consumption driven by a booming market for consumer borrowing .
and it left latvia extremely vulnerable to the shocks of the current financial crisis .
in recent months the economy has gone into reverse , with analysts predicting a severe recession and rumors of an impending devaluation of the national currency , the lats , sweeping the country .

the council donates £ 34,000 a year to shelter , but it is looking at making extensive savings .
the charity claimed a funding reduction would force it to cut its advice service in the county , and this would place people at risk .
powys council said a decision had not been made , but it had to make savings .
the local authority is looking at making cutbacks in a number of areas following a " challenging " budget settlement from the welsh assembly government .
many of the cost-cutting plans have proved unpopular , including the council 's street light switch-off which has seen thousands of lamps blacked-out across the county .
this potential decision stands to leave hundreds of people at risk of homelessness without specialist help john puzey , shelter cymru however , some lights are being switched back on for part of the night following a review .
shelter cymru provides free specialist advice , advocacy and legal representation for people in mortgage arrears across wales , but it could be forced to reduce this specialist help in powys by one-third .
director of shelter cymru john puzey said : " this potential decision stands to leave hundreds of people at risk of homelessness without specialist help .
" whilst we fully appreciate the financial challenges faced by local government , it seems very short-sighted to propose such a cut at this time of increasing mortgage repossessions , a time when most authorities are considering how they can build up their local response to the affordability crisis . "
the charity 's head of services jj costello added : " specialist housing advice plays an important role in the prevention of homelessness .
this decision will result in increased demand upon already over-stretched statutory services . "
possession actions the council has funded shelter since 2001 .
during 2007-08 , the charity helped 611 people in powys , dealing with 982 housing problems and opening 321 cases .
the charity said 57 % of those households were facing homelessness , and a third were at an imminent risk of homelessness as they faced possession actions from either a mortgage lender or a landlord .
a powys council spokesman said cuts had to be made .
he added : " the disappointing financial allocation from the welsh assembly government for 2009-2010 for powys county council means that a number of efficiencies / cuts have to be made in a number of areas .
" one of the areas under consideration is the funding provided to shelter cymru to provide housing advice services in powys , although it must be stressed that no final decision has been made by the council on this matter . "

powys council said a decision had not been made , but it had to make savings .
the local authority is looking at making cutbacks in a number of areas following a " challenging " budget settlement from the welsh assembly government .
many of the cost-cutting plans have proved unpopular , including the council 's street light switch-off which has seen thousands of lamps blacked-out across the county .
this potential decision stands to leave hundreds of people at risk of homelessness without specialist help john puzey , shelter cymru however , some lights are being switched back on for part of the night following a review .
shelter cymru provides free specialist advice , advocacy and legal representation for people in mortgage arrears across wales , but it could be forced to reduce this specialist help in powys by one-third .
director of shelter cymru john puzey said : " this potential decision stands to leave hundreds of people at risk of homelessness without specialist help .
" whilst we fully appreciate the financial challenges faced by local government , it seems very short-sighted to propose such a cut at this time of increasing mortgage repossessions , a time when most authorities are considering how they can build up their local response to the affordability crisis . "
the charity 's head of services jj costello added : " specialist housing advice plays an important role in the prevention of homelessness .
this decision will result in increased demand upon already over-stretched statutory services . "
possession actions the council has funded shelter since 2001 .
during 2007-08 , the charity helped 611 people in powys , dealing with 982 housing problems and opening 321 cases .
the charity said 57 % of those households were facing homelessness , and a third were at an imminent risk of homelessness as they faced possession actions from either a mortgage lender or a landlord .
a powys council spokesman said cuts had to be made .
he added : " the disappointing financial allocation from the welsh assembly government for 2009-2010 for powys county council means that a number of efficiencies / cuts have to be made in a number of areas .
" one of the areas under consideration is the funding provided to shelter cymru to provide housing advice services in powys , although it must be stressed that no final decision has been made by the council on this matter . "

a bbc investigation found that in 2008 some social services saw more than 40 % of the children disappear .
it is feared that many of them will go on to be exploited by traffickers .
the figures , obtained by the bbc news website through freedom of information requests , were described as " worrying " by a childcare expert .
the figures show that between 2005 and 2008 , 138 children -lrb- out of 857 who had come to the attention of social services -rrb- were listed as having gone missing from social services .
the survey included councils involved in childcare in bedfordshire , buckinghamshire , cambridgeshire , essex , hertfordshire , norfolk , northamptonshire and suffolk .
suffolk county council , which covers an area including the giant container port of felixstowe , saw some of the highest number of children go missing .

christine beddoe , director of child protection charity ecpat uk , said she was concerned by the figures .
" some traffickers get people into the country and they go into local authority care and are targeted to take them away , " she said .
" some of the children have been groomed to run away with full instructions on how to get away from their carers .
children seeking asylum would be entitled to benefits and care .
we have been lobbying for a guardian system to support children . "
' worrying ' figures a guardian would be an individual given legal responsibility for them .
dr ravi kohli , bedfordshire university 's head of the department of applied social studies , said the figures were worrying but not surprising .
" children are more likely to disappear if they have some connections with traffickers or organised gangs , " said dr kohli , author of the book social work with unaccompanied asylum seeking children .
" the children are brought to the country , where the family pays for the procurement , and that price needs to be paid off , particularly with older children and girls through sexual exploitation .
" for boys it is more likely they will be trafficked for credit card fraud . "
he said he knew of one case in which " children from china had mobile phone numbers -lrb- of traffickers -rrb- sewn into their clothing " .
he said councils need more funds to deal with the problems .
" there have been attempts in at least two parts of the country to provide safe houses - not accessible to the criminal networks , " he said , but this costs money .
" at the moment local authorities are not getting sufficient funding to get this set up . "
he said knowledge of the concerns among social service staff on the issues is " patchy " .
he said " more awareness " of the issues was needed .

a department for children , schools and families spokeswoman said : " we recognise the vulnerability of unaccompanied asylum seeking children .

it is feared that many of them will go on to be exploited by traffickers .
the figures , obtained by the bbc news website through freedom of information requests , were described as " worrying " by a childcare expert .
the figures show that between 2005 and 2008 , 138 children -lrb- out of 857 who had come to the attention of social services -rrb- were listed as having gone missing from social services .
the survey included councils involved in childcare in bedfordshire , buckinghamshire , cambridgeshire , essex , hertfordshire , norfolk , northamptonshire and suffolk .

the survey included councils involved in childcare in bedfordshire , buckinghamshire , cambridgeshire , essex , hertfordshire , norfolk , northamptonshire and suffolk .
suffolk county council , which covers an area including the giant container port of felixstowe , saw some of the highest number of children go missing .
in 2008 , 20 out of 48 children aged under 18 disappeared in suffolk .
missing foreign children in 2008 -lrb- total numbers in brackets -rrb- beds 0 -lrb- 18 -rrb- milton keynes 4 -lrb- 18 -rrb- cambs 12 -lrb- 57 -rrb- essex 2 -lrb- 39 -rrb- herts 10 -lrb- 36 -rrb- norfolk 3 -lrb- 7 -rrb- northants 5 -lrb- 87 -rrb- suffolk 20 -lrb- 48 -rrb- they included 12 afghanis , two chinese , four indian , one iranian and one iraqi .
christine beddoe , director of child protection charity ecpat uk , said she was concerned by the figures .
" some traffickers get people into the country and they go into local authority care and are targeted to take them away , " she said .
" some of the children have been groomed to run away with full instructions on how to get away from their carers .
children seeking asylum would be entitled to benefits and care .
we have been lobbying for a guardian system to support children . "
' worrying ' figures a guardian would be an individual given legal responsibility for them .
dr ravi kohli , bedfordshire university 's head of the department of applied social studies , said the figures were worrying but not surprising .
" children are more likely to disappear if they have some connections with traffickers or organised gangs , " said dr kohli , author of the book social work with unaccompanied asylum seeking children .
" the children are brought to the country , where the family pays for the procurement , and that price needs to be paid off , particularly with older children and girls through sexual exploitation .
" for boys it is more likely they will be trafficked for credit card fraud . "
he said he knew of one case in which " children from china had mobile phone numbers -lrb- of traffickers -rrb- sewn into their clothing " .
he said councils need more funds to deal with the problems .
" there have been attempts in at least two parts of the country to provide safe houses - not accessible to the criminal networks , " he said , but this costs money .
" at the moment local authorities are not getting sufficient funding to get this set up . "
he said knowledge of the concerns among social service staff on the issues is " patchy " .
he said " more awareness " of the issues was needed .
' mistrust ' common pam dajda , of hertfordshire county council - where 10 out of 36 children went missing in 2008 , said : " when newly arrived many of the young people are very guarded .
" this is very common amongst asylum seekers and reflects their mistrust of authority .
" consequently , the reasons why children and young people may go missing are not always clear .
" there are several reasons why this may happen .
it may be because the ' child ' is a young adult who has claimed to be a child in order to avoid immigration detention .
it may be that they are planning to join a contact in the uk .
" any concerns about trafficking are always referred to the police and taken into account when agreeing a response . "
milton keynes council said : " this year two young men , who said they were 16/17 , have gone missing shortly after being provided with accommodation by us .
we believe they went to personal contacts in other parts of the country . "
a department for children , schools and families spokeswoman said : " we recognise the vulnerability of unaccompanied asylum seeking children .
" it is a duty for local authorities to make sure looked after children are properly safeguarded wherever they are placed . "

a government official said there would also be more short-range missiles , combat planes , helicopters , tanks and naval vessels .
in all , russia will spend nearly $ 140bn -lrb- £ 94.5bn -rrb- on buying arms .
higher oil revenues in recent years have allowed the kremlin to increase the military budget , analysts say .
the move comes months after the war with georgia , which exposed problems with outdated equipment and practices within russia 's armed forces and led to calls for military modernisation .
missile row the comments came from vladislav putilin , whose department oversees weapons industries , after a government session chaired by prime minister vladimir putin .
" more than 70 strategic missiles will be bought and delivered to troops in the next three years , more than 30 short-range iskander missiles and a large number of booster rockets and aircraft , " interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
the military would also purchase 14 naval vessels , 48 combat jets , more than 60 military helicopters and almost 300 tanks , he added .
the move comes amid tensions with the us over its plan to deploy elements of a missile shield in eastern europe .
last month president dmitry medvedev said russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad , a baltic enclave near nato member poland , if the us went ahead .

outside active war zones -lrb- and srinagar does n't fit that description any longer -rrb- the main city in indian-administered kashmir is one of the most heavily militarised places i 've ever seen .
hardly a great advert for indian democracy .
every 50 metres or so , on every main street , stand several men -lrb- or very occasionally women -rrb- armed with assault rifles and - more often than not - big sticks .
these , it seems , are the only conditions under which elections are possible .
there are undeclared curfews and a blanket of security across the city .
half a million army and police personnel keep watch over kashmir , and srinagar has more than its fair share .
other parts of jammu and kashmir have seen higher voting figures than expected in this election season .
but srinagar is stubborn , and resentment against indian rule runs deep .
on the election trail on the edge of town , omar abdullah , son of a famous kashmiri family , addresses a small crowd as icy rain drifts down from the misty mountains .
there 's razor wire in the haystacks .
sitting on a makeshift stage on the back of a lorry , he tells me he 's hoping turnout in srinagar will reach double figures .
but he does n't look like he 'd bet on it .
" we 'd rather not campaign under such tight security , " he says , surrounded by yet more armed men .
" the gun has changed nothing for us politically , but it has destroyed us economically , and it has had a huge impact on us socially . "
living in hope in lal chowk , srinagar 's central market square , hilal ahmed pushes a cart loaded with onions , beans and tomatoes past a watchful line of paramilitary police .
" this is the reality of our lives , " ahmed says .
" one day we trade , and the next day everything is closed . "
on the other side of the road another policeman shouts at a group of young men who peer round the corner at the row of empty shuttered shops .
" just go away , " he says .
" i 've told you so many times .
next time , you 'll get beaten - do n't say i did n't warn you . "
down in the old town , the jama masjid , srinagar 's finest mosque , is one of the symbols of kashmiri identity .
on friday at noon it should be packed with worshippers coming to pray .
but it too is totally deserted .
the magnificent wooden and brass doors which open into the courtyard of the mosque are padlocked shut - there have been no friday prayers here for six weeks .
in the surrounding streets the indian security forces have enforced a total shut down .
" this is wrong , " mutters a local kashmiri policeman , as we stand and stare down an empty road .
" this is a religious matter . "
" do you think kashmir will ever be independent ? "
i ask .
" i hope so , " he replies .
" i say that as a kashmiri , i hope so . "
freedom is there actually a threat which might justify all this extraordinary security ?
the nature of the separatist campaign has been changing , moving away from armed insurgency towards other forms of protest like street campaigns .
and compared with earlier years this election has been relatively peaceful .
but two policemen were shot dead on monday just north of srinagar , and a few days earlier three militants from lashkar-e-taiba were killed in a clash with troops in a remote mountainous region .
ah yes , lashkar-e-taiba , the group blamed for the mumbai attacks in november .
lest we forget , lashkar was originally formed to kick india out of kashmir .
so how do kashmiris feel about them now ?
i discuss this with khurram parvez , as we sit on a wall overlooking dal lake .
a human rights activist , he has a personal interest in the subject .
he was badly injured when his vehicle hit a landmine in 2004 .
" the authorities told me lashkar-e-taiba had planted the mine , " he says .
" that 's why i went to talk to them . "
they were seen by many people , he says , as an organisation which was fighting the " indian occupation " in any way it could .
" but if they have done what has happened in mumbai , it has already affected the popularity of lashkar-e-taiba in kashmir .
" because people somehow think that if lashkar-e-taiba is responsible for killing innocent people like this , then they ca n't fight for anyone 's rights , anyone 's freedom .
because they are people who do not believe in any freedom . "
' political problem ' a large police truck is blocking the front gate at the house of mirwaiz omar farooq , one of the main leaders of the peaceful campaign for kashmiri independence .
he 's under house arrest , and we 're not allowed in .
the local police chief gives us a cup of tea and biscuits , and says it 's all for the mirwaiz 's own safety .
i go round the corner and call the mirwaiz on his mobile phone .
srinagar , he says , is like a jail .
but he agrees that lashkar-e-taiba and the accusations it faces over the mumbai attacks have done kashmir no favours .
" definitely it has cast a negative shadow over the kashmir issue , " he says .
" it gives leverage to those who want to link kashmir with international terrorism and extremism .
" the fact is that kashmir is a political problem , and we have to find a political solution to it . "
but for separatists like mirwaiz omar farooq that does n't include fighting elections under the indian constitution .
bread and butter issues most of those who will vote are n't trying to make grand political statements .
elections are about bread and butter issues - the cost of food , jobs , daily life .
tensions between india and pakistan do n't really figure .
as a pale sun begins to set behind the mountains , another modest election rally begins on dal lake itself .
party workers in green hats , accompanied by the obligatory men with guns , scramble aboard small boats .
political slogans echo faintly across the water .
" for years we had lots of problems here , " says muzaffar ahmed .
" but the problems are now between two countries .
not here in kashmir . "
the trouble is that kashmir remains central to the disputes between india and pakistan .
and the long term questions about its political future look set to drag on and on .

freedom is there actually a threat which might justify all this extraordinary security ?
the nature of the separatist campaign has been changing , moving away from armed insurgency towards other forms of protest like street campaigns .
and compared with earlier years this election has been relatively peaceful .
but two policemen were shot dead on monday just north of srinagar , and a few days earlier three militants from lashkar-e-taiba were killed in a clash with troops in a remote mountainous region .
khurram pervez says killing innocents is no way to fight for freedom ah yes , lashkar-e-taiba , the group blamed for the mumbai attacks in november .
lest we forget , lashkar was originally formed to kick india out of kashmir .
so how do kashmiris feel about them now ?
i discuss this with khurram parvez , as we sit on a wall overlooking dal lake .
a human rights activist , he has a personal interest in the subject .
he was badly injured when his vehicle hit a landmine in 2004 .
" the authorities told me lashkar-e-taiba had planted the mine , " he says .
" that 's why i went to talk to them . "
they were seen by many people , he says , as an organisation which was fighting the " indian occupation " in any way it could .
" but if they have done what has happened in mumbai , it has already affected the popularity of lashkar-e-taiba in kashmir .
" because people somehow think that if lashkar-e-taiba is responsible for killing innocent people like this , then they ca n't fight for anyone 's rights , anyone 's freedom .
because they are people who do not believe in any freedom . "
' political problem ' a large police truck is blocking the front gate at the house of mirwaiz omar farooq , one of the main leaders of the peaceful campaign for kashmiri independence .
he 's under house arrest , and we 're not allowed in .
mirwaiz omar farooq : ' kashmir is a political problem ' the local police chief gives us a cup of tea and biscuits , and says it 's all for the mirwaiz 's own safety .
i go round the corner and call the mirwaiz on his mobile phone .
srinagar , he says , is like a jail .
but he agrees that lashkar-e-taiba and the accusations it faces over the mumbai attacks have done kashmir no favours .
" definitely it has cast a negative shadow over the kashmir issue , " he says .
" it gives leverage to those who want to link kashmir with international terrorism and extremism .
" the fact is that kashmir is a political problem , and we have to find a political solution to it . "
but for separatists like mirwaiz omar farooq that does n't include fighting elections under the indian constitution .
bread and butter issues most of those who will vote are n't trying to make grand political statements .
a colourful election rally on dal lake elections are about bread and butter issues - the cost of food , jobs , daily life .
tensions between india and pakistan do n't really figure .
as a pale sun begins to set behind the mountains , another modest election rally begins on dal lake itself .
party workers in green hats , accompanied by the obligatory men with guns , scramble aboard small boats .
political slogans echo faintly across the water .
" for years we had lots of problems here , " says muzaffar ahmed .
" but the problems are now between two countries .
not here in kashmir . "
the trouble is that kashmir remains central to the disputes between india and pakistan .
and the long term questions about its political future look set to drag on and on .

outside active war zones -lrb- and srinagar does n't fit that description any longer -rrb- the main city in indian-administered kashmir is one of the most heavily militarised places i 've ever seen .
hardly a great advert for indian democracy .
every 50 metres or so , on every main street , stand several men -lrb- or very occasionally women -rrb- armed with assault rifles and - more often than not - big sticks .
these , it seems , are the only conditions under which elections are possible .
there are undeclared curfews and a blanket of security across the city .
half a million army and police personnel keep watch over kashmir , and srinagar has more than its fair share .
other parts of jammu and kashmir have seen higher voting figures than expected in this election season .
but srinagar is stubborn , and resentment against indian rule runs deep .
on the election trail on the edge of town , omar abdullah , son of a famous kashmiri family , addresses a small crowd as icy rain drifts down from the misty mountains .
there 's razor wire in the haystacks .
sitting on a makeshift stage on the back of a lorry , he tells me he 's hoping turnout in srinagar will reach double figures .
but he does n't look like he 'd bet on it .
" we 'd rather not campaign under such tight security , " he says , surrounded by yet more armed men .
" the gun has changed nothing for us politically , but it has destroyed us economically , and it has had a huge impact on us socially . "
living in hope in lal chowk , srinagar 's central market square , hilal ahmed pushes a cart loaded with onions , beans and tomatoes past a watchful line of paramilitary police .
omar abdullah : ' the gun has destroyed us economically ' " this is the reality of our lives , " ahmed says .
" one day we trade , and the next day everything is closed . "
on the other side of the road another policeman shouts at a group of young men who peer round the corner at the row of empty shuttered shops .
" just go away , " he says .
" i 've told you so many times .
next time , you 'll get beaten - do n't say i did n't warn you . "
down in the old town , the jama masjid , srinagar 's finest mosque , is one of the symbols of kashmiri identity .
on friday at noon it should be packed with worshippers coming to pray .
but it too is totally deserted .
the magnificent wooden and brass doors which open into the courtyard of the mosque are padlocked shut - there have been no friday prayers here for six weeks .
in the surrounding streets the indian security forces have enforced a total shut down .
" this is wrong , " mutters a local kashmiri policeman , as we stand and stare down an empty road .
" this is a religious matter . "
" do you think kashmir will ever be independent ? "
i ask .

outside active war zones -lrb- and srinagar does n't fit that description any longer -rrb- the main city in indian-administered kashmir is one of the most heavily militarised places i 've ever seen .
hardly a great advert for indian democracy .
every 50 metres or so , on every main street , stand several men -lrb- or very occasionally women -rrb- armed with assault rifles and - more often than not - big sticks .
these , it seems , are the only conditions under which elections are possible .
there are undeclared curfews and a blanket of security across the city .
half a million army and police personnel keep watch over kashmir , and srinagar has more than its fair share .
other parts of jammu and kashmir have seen higher voting figures than expected in this election season .
but srinagar is stubborn , and resentment against indian rule runs deep .
on the election trail on the edge of town , omar abdullah , son of a famous kashmiri family , addresses a small crowd as icy rain drifts down from the misty mountains .
there 's razor wire in the haystacks .
sitting on a makeshift stage on the back of a lorry , he tells me he 's hoping turnout in srinagar will reach double figures .
but he does n't look like he 'd bet on it .
" we 'd rather not campaign under such tight security , " he says , surrounded by yet more armed men .
" the gun has changed nothing for us politically , but it has destroyed us economically , and it has had a huge impact on us socially . "
living in hope in lal chowk , srinagar 's central market square , hilal ahmed pushes a cart loaded with onions , beans and tomatoes past a watchful line of paramilitary police .
omar abdullah : ' the gun has destroyed us economically ' " this is the reality of our lives , " ahmed says .
" one day we trade , and the next day everything is closed . "
on the other side of the road another policeman shouts at a group of young men who peer round the corner at the row of empty shuttered shops .
" just go away , " he says .
" i 've told you so many times .
next time , you 'll get beaten - do n't say i did n't warn you . "
down in the old town , the jama masjid , srinagar 's finest mosque , is one of the symbols of kashmiri identity .
on friday at noon it should be packed with worshippers coming to pray .
but it too is totally deserted .
the magnificent wooden and brass doors which open into the courtyard of the mosque are padlocked shut - there have been no friday prayers here for six weeks .
in the surrounding streets the indian security forces have enforced a total shut down .
" this is wrong , " mutters a local kashmiri policeman , as we stand and stare down an empty road .
" this is a religious matter . "
" do you think kashmir will ever be independent ? "
i ask .
" i hope so , " he replies .
" i say that as a kashmiri , i hope so . "
freedom is there actually a threat which might justify all this extraordinary security ?
the nature of the separatist campaign has been changing , moving away from armed insurgency towards other forms of protest like street campaigns .
and compared with earlier years this election has been relatively peaceful .
but two policemen were shot dead on monday just north of srinagar , and a few days earlier three militants from lashkar-e-taiba were killed in a clash with troops in a remote mountainous region .
khurram pervez says killing innocents is no way to fight for freedom ah yes , lashkar-e-taiba , the group blamed for the mumbai attacks in november .
lest we forget , lashkar was originally formed to kick india out of kashmir .
so how do kashmiris feel about them now ?
i discuss this with khurram parvez , as we sit on a wall overlooking dal lake .
a human rights activist , he has a personal interest in the subject .
he was badly injured when his vehicle hit a landmine in 2004 .
" the authorities told me lashkar-e-taiba had planted the mine , " he says .
" that 's why i went to talk to them . "
they were seen by many people , he says , as an organisation which was fighting the " indian occupation " in any way it could .
" but if they have done what has happened in mumbai , it has already affected the popularity of lashkar-e-taiba in kashmir .
" because people somehow think that if lashkar-e-taiba is responsible for killing innocent people like this , then they ca n't fight for anyone 's rights , anyone 's freedom .
because they are people who do not believe in any freedom . "
' political problem ' a large police truck is blocking the front gate at the house of mirwaiz omar farooq , one of the main leaders of the peaceful campaign for kashmiri independence .
he 's under house arrest , and we 're not allowed in .
mirwaiz omar farooq : ' kashmir is a political problem ' the local police chief gives us a cup of tea and biscuits , and says it 's all for the mirwaiz 's own safety .
i go round the corner and call the mirwaiz on his mobile phone .
srinagar , he says , is like a jail .
but he agrees that lashkar-e-taiba and the accusations it faces over the mumbai attacks have done kashmir no favours .
" definitely it has cast a negative shadow over the kashmir issue , " he says .
" it gives leverage to those who want to link kashmir with international terrorism and extremism .
" the fact is that kashmir is a political problem , and we have to find a political solution to it . "
but for separatists like mirwaiz omar farooq that does n't include fighting elections under the indian constitution .

outside active war zones -lrb- and srinagar does n't fit that description any longer -rrb- the main city in indian-administered kashmir is one of the most heavily militarised places i 've ever seen .
hardly a great advert for indian democracy .
every 50 metres or so , on every main street , stand several men -lrb- or very occasionally women -rrb- armed with assault rifles and - more often than not - big sticks .
these , it seems , are the only conditions under which elections are possible .
there are undeclared curfews and a blanket of security across the city .
half a million army and police personnel keep watch over kashmir , and srinagar has more than its fair share .
other parts of jammu and kashmir have seen higher voting figures than expected in this election season .
but srinagar is stubborn , and resentment against indian rule runs deep .
on the election trail on the edge of town , omar abdullah , son of a famous kashmiri family , addresses a small crowd as icy rain drifts down from the misty mountains .
there 's razor wire in the haystacks .
sitting on a makeshift stage on the back of a lorry , he tells me he 's hoping turnout in srinagar will reach double figures .
but he does n't look like he 'd bet on it .
" we 'd rather not campaign under such tight security , " he says , surrounded by yet more armed men .
" the gun has changed nothing for us politically , but it has destroyed us economically , and it has had a huge impact on us socially . "
living in hope in lal chowk , srinagar 's central market square , hilal ahmed pushes a cart loaded with onions , beans and tomatoes past a watchful line of paramilitary police .
omar abdullah : ' the gun has destroyed us economically ' " this is the reality of our lives , " ahmed says .
" one day we trade , and the next day everything is closed . "
on the other side of the road another policeman shouts at a group of young men who peer round the corner at the row of empty shuttered shops .
" just go away , " he says .
" i 've told you so many times .
next time , you 'll get beaten - do n't say i did n't warn you . "
down in the old town , the jama masjid , srinagar 's finest mosque , is one of the symbols of kashmiri identity .
on friday at noon it should be packed with worshippers coming to pray .
but it too is totally deserted .
the magnificent wooden and brass doors which open into the courtyard of the mosque are padlocked shut - there have been no friday prayers here for six weeks .
in the surrounding streets the indian security forces have enforced a total shut down .
" this is wrong , " mutters a local kashmiri policeman , as we stand and stare down an empty road .
" this is a religious matter . "
" do you think kashmir will ever be independent ? "
i ask .
" i hope so , " he replies .
" i say that as a kashmiri , i hope so . "
freedom is there actually a threat which might justify all this extraordinary security ?
the nature of the separatist campaign has been changing , moving away from armed insurgency towards other forms of protest like street campaigns .
and compared with earlier years this election has been relatively peaceful .
but two policemen were shot dead on monday just north of srinagar , and a few days earlier three militants from lashkar-e-taiba were killed in a clash with troops in a remote mountainous region .
khurram pervez says killing innocents is no way to fight for freedom ah yes , lashkar-e-taiba , the group blamed for the mumbai attacks in november .
lest we forget , lashkar was originally formed to kick india out of kashmir .
so how do kashmiris feel about them now ?
i discuss this with khurram parvez , as we sit on a wall overlooking dal lake .
a human rights activist , he has a personal interest in the subject .
he was badly injured when his vehicle hit a landmine in 2004 .
" the authorities told me lashkar-e-taiba had planted the mine , " he says .
" that 's why i went to talk to them . "
they were seen by many people , he says , as an organisation which was fighting the " indian occupation " in any way it could .
" but if they have done what has happened in mumbai , it has already affected the popularity of lashkar-e-taiba in kashmir .
" because people somehow think that if lashkar-e-taiba is responsible for killing innocent people like this , then they ca n't fight for anyone 's rights , anyone 's freedom .
because they are people who do not believe in any freedom . "
' political problem ' a large police truck is blocking the front gate at the house of mirwaiz omar farooq , one of the main leaders of the peaceful campaign for kashmiri independence .
he 's under house arrest , and we 're not allowed in .
mirwaiz omar farooq : ' kashmir is a political problem ' the local police chief gives us a cup of tea and biscuits , and says it 's all for the mirwaiz 's own safety .
i go round the corner and call the mirwaiz on his mobile phone .
srinagar , he says , is like a jail .
but he agrees that lashkar-e-taiba and the accusations it faces over the mumbai attacks have done kashmir no favours .
" definitely it has cast a negative shadow over the kashmir issue , " he says .
" it gives leverage to those who want to link kashmir with international terrorism and extremism .
" the fact is that kashmir is a political problem , and we have to find a political solution to it . "
but for separatists like mirwaiz omar farooq that does n't include fighting elections under the indian constitution .
bread and butter issues most of those who will vote are n't trying to make grand political statements .
a colourful election rally on dal lake elections are about bread and butter issues - the cost of food , jobs , daily life .
tensions between india and pakistan do n't really figure .
as a pale sun begins to set behind the mountains , another modest election rally begins on dal lake itself .
party workers in green hats , accompanied by the obligatory men with guns , scramble aboard small boats .
political slogans echo faintly across the water .
" for years we had lots of problems here , " says muzaffar ahmed .
" but the problems are now between two countries .
not here in kashmir . "
the trouble is that kashmir remains central to the disputes between india and pakistan .
and the long term questions about its political future look set to drag on and on .

every 50 metres or so , on every main street , stand several men -lrb- or very occasionally women -rrb- armed with assault rifles and - more often than not - big sticks .
these , it seems , are the only conditions under which elections are possible .
there are undeclared curfews and a blanket of security across the city .
half a million army and police personnel keep watch over kashmir , and srinagar has more than its fair share .
other parts of jammu and kashmir have seen higher voting figures than expected in this election season .
but srinagar is stubborn , and resentment against indian rule runs deep .
on the election trail on the edge of town , omar abdullah , son of a famous kashmiri family , addresses a small crowd as icy rain drifts down from the misty mountains .
there 's razor wire in the haystacks .
sitting on a makeshift stage on the back of a lorry , he tells me he 's hoping turnout in srinagar will reach double figures .
but he does n't look like he 'd bet on it .
" we 'd rather not campaign under such tight security , " he says , surrounded by yet more armed men .
" the gun has changed nothing for us politically , but it has destroyed us economically , and it has had a huge impact on us socially . "
living in hope in lal chowk , srinagar 's central market square , hilal ahmed pushes a cart loaded with onions , beans and tomatoes past a watchful line of paramilitary police .
omar abdullah : ' the gun has destroyed us economically ' " this is the reality of our lives , " ahmed says .
" one day we trade , and the next day everything is closed . "
on the other side of the road another policeman shouts at a group of young men who peer round the corner at the row of empty shuttered shops .
" just go away , " he says .
" i 've told you so many times .
next time , you 'll get beaten - do n't say i did n't warn you . "
down in the old town , the jama masjid , srinagar 's finest mosque , is one of the symbols of kashmiri identity .
on friday at noon it should be packed with worshippers coming to pray .
but it too is totally deserted .
the magnificent wooden and brass doors which open into the courtyard of the mosque are padlocked shut - there have been no friday prayers here for six weeks .
in the surrounding streets the indian security forces have enforced a total shut down .
" this is wrong , " mutters a local kashmiri policeman , as we stand and stare down an empty road .
" this is a religious matter . "
" do you think kashmir will ever be independent ? "
i ask .
" i hope so , " he replies .
" i say that as a kashmiri , i hope so . "
freedom is there actually a threat which might justify all this extraordinary security ?
the nature of the separatist campaign has been changing , moving away from armed insurgency towards other forms of protest like street campaigns .
and compared with earlier years this election has been relatively peaceful .
but two policemen were shot dead on monday just north of srinagar , and a few days earlier three militants from lashkar-e-taiba were killed in a clash with troops in a remote mountainous region .
khurram pervez says killing innocents is no way to fight for freedom ah yes , lashkar-e-taiba , the group blamed for the mumbai attacks in november .
lest we forget , lashkar was originally formed to kick india out of kashmir .
so how do kashmiris feel about them now ?
i discuss this with khurram parvez , as we sit on a wall overlooking dal lake .
a human rights activist , he has a personal interest in the subject .
he was badly injured when his vehicle hit a landmine in 2004 .
" the authorities told me lashkar-e-taiba had planted the mine , " he says .
" that 's why i went to talk to them . "
they were seen by many people , he says , as an organisation which was fighting the " indian occupation " in any way it could .
" but if they have done what has happened in mumbai , it has already affected the popularity of lashkar-e-taiba in kashmir .
" because people somehow think that if lashkar-e-taiba is responsible for killing innocent people like this , then they ca n't fight for anyone 's rights , anyone 's freedom .
because they are people who do not believe in any freedom . "
' political problem ' a large police truck is blocking the front gate at the house of mirwaiz omar farooq , one of the main leaders of the peaceful campaign for kashmiri independence .
he 's under house arrest , and we 're not allowed in .
mirwaiz omar farooq : ' kashmir is a political problem ' the local police chief gives us a cup of tea and biscuits , and says it 's all for the mirwaiz 's own safety .
i go round the corner and call the mirwaiz on his mobile phone .
srinagar , he says , is like a jail .
but he agrees that lashkar-e-taiba and the accusations it faces over the mumbai attacks have done kashmir no favours .
" definitely it has cast a negative shadow over the kashmir issue , " he says .
" it gives leverage to those who want to link kashmir with international terrorism and extremism .
" the fact is that kashmir is a political problem , and we have to find a political solution to it . "
but for separatists like mirwaiz omar farooq that does n't include fighting elections under the indian constitution .
bread and butter issues most of those who will vote are n't trying to make grand political statements .
a colourful election rally on dal lake elections are about bread and butter issues - the cost of food , jobs , daily life .
tensions between india and pakistan do n't really figure .
as a pale sun begins to set behind the mountains , another modest election rally begins on dal lake itself .
party workers in green hats , accompanied by the obligatory men with guns , scramble aboard small boats .
political slogans echo faintly across the water .
" for years we had lots of problems here , " says muzaffar ahmed .
" but the problems are now between two countries .
not here in kashmir . "
the trouble is that kashmir remains central to the disputes between india and pakistan .
and the long term questions about its political future look set to drag on and on .

and compared with earlier years this election has been relatively peaceful .
but two policemen were shot dead on monday just north of srinagar , and a few days earlier three militants from lashkar-e-taiba were killed in a clash with troops in a remote mountainous region .
khurram pervez says killing innocents is no way to fight for freedom ah yes , lashkar-e-taiba , the group blamed for the mumbai attacks in november .
lest we forget , lashkar was originally formed to kick india out of kashmir .
so how do kashmiris feel about them now ?
i discuss this with khurram parvez , as we sit on a wall overlooking dal lake .
a human rights activist , he has a personal interest in the subject .
he was badly injured when his vehicle hit a landmine in 2004 .
" the authorities told me lashkar-e-taiba had planted the mine , " he says .
" that 's why i went to talk to them . "
they were seen by many people , he says , as an organisation which was fighting the " indian occupation " in any way it could .
" but if they have done what has happened in mumbai , it has already affected the popularity of lashkar-e-taiba in kashmir .
" because people somehow think that if lashkar-e-taiba is responsible for killing innocent people like this , then they ca n't fight for anyone 's rights , anyone 's freedom .
because they are people who do not believe in any freedom . "
' political problem ' a large police truck is blocking the front gate at the house of mirwaiz omar farooq , one of the main leaders of the peaceful campaign for kashmiri independence .
he 's under house arrest , and we 're not allowed in .
mirwaiz omar farooq : ' kashmir is a political problem ' the local police chief gives us a cup of tea and biscuits , and says it 's all for the mirwaiz 's own safety .
i go round the corner and call the mirwaiz on his mobile phone .
srinagar , he says , is like a jail .
but he agrees that lashkar-e-taiba and the accusations it faces over the mumbai attacks have done kashmir no favours .
" definitely it has cast a negative shadow over the kashmir issue , " he says .
" it gives leverage to those who want to link kashmir with international terrorism and extremism .
" the fact is that kashmir is a political problem , and we have to find a political solution to it . "
but for separatists like mirwaiz omar farooq that does n't include fighting elections under the indian constitution .
bread and butter issues most of those who will vote are n't trying to make grand political statements .
a colourful election rally on dal lake elections are about bread and butter issues - the cost of food , jobs , daily life .
tensions between india and pakistan do n't really figure .
as a pale sun begins to set behind the mountains , another modest election rally begins on dal lake itself .
party workers in green hats , accompanied by the obligatory men with guns , scramble aboard small boats .
political slogans echo faintly across the water .
" for years we had lots of problems here , " says muzaffar ahmed .
" but the problems are now between two countries .
not here in kashmir . "
the trouble is that kashmir remains central to the disputes between india and pakistan .
and the long term questions about its political future look set to drag on and on .

it was in december 1978 that former leader deng xiaoping declared the country would not just tolerate private enterprise but encourage it .
since then , of course , much of the country has been transformed .
millions of people have moved from the countryside to the cities in search of a better life .
and after three decades of extraordinary economic growth , there are growing numbers of middle class chinese with good jobs who are well-off relative to the rest of the population .
now some of those who moved to cities like shanghai for good wages in white collar jobs are starting to tire of the rat race , and in a reversal of past patterns of movement are abandoning the urban sprawl for a quieter life in the country .
country life gao hong and yang xiaoling , two advertising executives in their mid-thirties , decided a year ago to give up their lucrative careers to move to a quiet house in the country , eight hours drive from shanghai in jiangxi province .
they took a 40-year lease on an old house which yang xiaoling came across during a business trip .
" she found it when she was looking for a handmade umbrella , " her husband gao hong explained , sitting in the sunshine in their garden on a bright but cold december morning .
yang xiaoling says there were several reasons why they decided to move .
she did not like their life in the city .
" you work in a company like you are in a machine , " she said .
" your working life runs in a groove , you do what you 're told . "
" people in the city are indifferent to each other , " her husband added .
" here our neighbours come and join us for meals often , they sit in the sun with us in the garden and chat all the time .
we never lock our door . "
" we lived in shanghai for years but we had no contact with 90 % of our neighbours .
if you have no contact with your neighbour , you have no idea what kind of person they are . "
' hampering development ' the couple have blogged extensively about their new life and their reasons for choosing it .
in the tiny unheated room with wooden floors where they log on , they power up their laptop to display the large number of responses they have had from other netizens .
" many say that deep in their hearts they have the same ambition that we had , " yang xiaoling explained .
but some are not so sure .
one woman who called herself " shanghai girl " chastised the couple for opting out .
" she said : ' you are 35 , you should be the backbone of society , but you are choosing to abandon yourself to a life of pleasure ' , " yang xiaoling said .
" she told us : ' you are misleading people , you are hampering social development ' . "
the couple said that after this post other netizens added comments defending them , declaring that everyone had a right to choose their own lifestyle .
" i do n't pose any threat to society , and i enjoy the pleasure of farming ; i think that 's beautiful , " said yang xiaoling .
' we belong ' the couple admit that it has not all been as easy and straightforward as they would have liked .
their neighbours had to help them establish their vegetable garden because they did not really know what they were doing .
they have grown enough to eat , but nowhere near enough to sell to others .
there are rats to deal with and the roof leaks .
but they say that compared with the difficulties they faced trying to get used to urban life , these problems are not that significant .
no-one is suggesting that the couple 's decision to leave the city is the start of a major trend in chinese society .
it is clear they had made enough money to stop work and try something quite different .
relatively few chinese would be that well off .
gao hong is writing a book about their experience .
they say once they have finished renovating the house they may open it as a guesthouse .
they also plan to help local people sell provisions and other goods in the cities .
they will live off their savings until these business ventures start to provide a return .
they say they see themselves as pioneers .
" we have lived here for more than a year , and never for a moment have we thought , this is too bad , we have got to get back to shanghai , " gao hong laughed .
leaving the front door wide open , the couple go for a stroll around the village .
facilities are very basic .
some of their neighbours are washing their clothes in the stream by hand .
it is like going back 50 or 60 years .
but the couple are happy .
" the dogs do n't bark at us now , " they said .
" they always bark at strangers , so we know we belong . "

it was in december 1978 that former leader deng xiaoping declared the country would not just tolerate private enterprise but encourage it .
since then , of course , much of the country has been transformed .
millions of people have moved from the countryside to the cities in search of a better life .
and after three decades of extraordinary economic growth , there are growing numbers of middle class chinese with good jobs who are well-off relative to the rest of the population .
now some of those who moved to cities like shanghai for good wages in white collar jobs are starting to tire of the rat race , and in a reversal of past patterns of movement are abandoning the urban sprawl for a quieter life in the country .
country life gao hong and yang xiaoling , two advertising executives in their mid-thirties , decided a year ago to give up their lucrative careers to move to a quiet house in the country , eight hours drive from shanghai in jiangxi province .
they took a 40-year lease on an old house which yang xiaoling came across during a business trip .
gao hong says country life offers a better sense of community " she found it when she was looking for a handmade umbrella , " her husband gao hong explained , sitting in the sunshine in their garden on a bright but cold december morning .
yang xiaoling says there were several reasons why they decided to move .
she did not like their life in the city .
" you work in a company like you are in a machine , " she said .
" your working life runs in a groove , you do what you 're told . "
" people in the city are indifferent to each other , " her husband added .
" here our neighbours come and join us for meals often , they sit in the sun with us in the garden and chat all the time .
we never lock our door . "
" we lived in shanghai for years but we had no contact with 90 % of our neighbours .
if you have no contact with your neighbour , you have no idea what kind of person they are . "
' hampering development ' the couple have blogged extensively about their new life and their reasons for choosing it .
in the tiny unheated room with wooden floors where they log on , they power up their laptop to display the large number of responses they have had from other netizens .
the couple want to help villagers sell goods to the cities " many say that deep in their hearts they have the same ambition that we had , " yang xiaoling explained .
but some are not so sure .
one woman who called herself " shanghai girl " chastised the couple for opting out .
" she said : ' you are 35 , you should be the backbone of society , but you are choosing to abandon yourself to a life of pleasure ' , " yang xiaoling said .
" she told us : ' you are misleading people , you are hampering social development ' . "
the couple said that after this post other netizens added comments defending them , declaring that everyone had a right to choose their own lifestyle .
" i do n't pose any threat to society , and i enjoy the pleasure of farming ; i think that 's beautiful , " said yang xiaoling .
' we belong ' the couple admit that it has not all been as easy and straightforward as they would have liked .
their neighbours had to help them establish their vegetable garden because they did not really know what they were doing .
they have grown enough to eat , but nowhere near enough to sell to others .
despite a lack of village facilities , the couple have no regrets there are rats to deal with and the roof leaks .
but they say that compared with the difficulties they faced trying to get used to urban life , these problems are not that significant .
no-one is suggesting that the couple 's decision to leave the city is the start of a major trend in chinese society .
it is clear they had made enough money to stop work and try something quite different .
relatively few chinese would be that well off .
gao hong is writing a book about their experience .
they say once they have finished renovating the house they may open it as a guesthouse .
they also plan to help local people sell provisions and other goods in the cities .
they will live off their savings until these business ventures start to provide a return .
they say they see themselves as pioneers .
" we have lived here for more than a year , and never for a moment have we thought , this is too bad , we have got to get back to shanghai , " gao hong laughed .
leaving the front door wide open , the couple go for a stroll around the village .
facilities are very basic .
some of their neighbours are washing their clothes in the stream by hand .
it is like going back 50 or 60 years .
but the couple are happy .
" the dogs do n't bark at us now , " they said .
" they always bark at strangers , so we know we belong . "
