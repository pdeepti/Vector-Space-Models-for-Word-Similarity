his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prime minister , however , has refused to step down . the leader of greece 's socialist opposition party renewed calls on sunday , dec .
14 , for conservative prime minister costas karamanlis to resign in light of the protests that have caused an estimated 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- in damage . georges papandreou said at a party conference that karamanlis ' government " ignores the calls of society , is incapable of steadily driving the country towards change and is afraid of the people . " rioting began after a 15-year-old boy was killed by a police bullet on dec .
6 .
though the violence has generally subsided over the past few days , groups of hooded youths have continued to firebomb buildings and businesses in night-time rampages . violence erupted again over the weekend as vigils were held to mark the week after the boy 's death .
protestors announced rallies on monday as well . widespread dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis has said greece needs a steady hand to deal with the economic crisis in an opinion poll published on sunday by greece 's ethnos newspaper , 83.3 percent of respondents said they were unhappy with the government 's response to the violence . according to another survey in the kathimerini daily , 68 percent disapproved of the government , with 60 percent saying the riots were a social uprising and not the work of fringe groups . " i 'm tired of coming to the shop every night to check the damages , " anna pavlidou , manager of an athens mobile phone store , told reuters news agency .
" the government should assume its responsibilities and resign … .

15 .
" we are aware that we are now facing a phase that will be difficult , but we are ready to work with our partners and deal with all the challenges that we will encounter , " djukanovic said .
" by taking this step , montenegro commits itself to the accession process and the building of a united europe which is a strategic goal in which the founders of the european community invested their vision and commitment , " the government press office said earlier in a statement .
the move by podgorica is expected to add impetus to eu membership bids by other balkan states such as albania and serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro recently split from serbia djukanovic also met in paris with eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who had gone on record last week saying that montenegro still had a lot of ground to cover before it could join the eu .

the european commission is also said to be preparing itself for an eu bid from iceland .
the commission is " mentally prepared " for a membership proposal from iceland early in 2009 , and negotiations could be swift because the island state already has such close ties with europe , rehn said last week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .
the research is published in the astrophysical journal . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .

" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 .
" we are aware that we are now facing a phase that will be difficult , but we are ready to work with our partners and deal with all the challenges that we will encounter , " djukanovic said .
" by taking this step , montenegro commits itself to the accession process and the building of a united europe which is a strategic goal in which the founders of the european community invested their vision and commitment , " the government press office said earlier in a statement .
the move by podgorica is expected to add impetus to eu membership bids by other balkan states such as albania and serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro recently split from serbia djukanovic also met in paris with eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who had gone on record last week saying that montenegro still had a lot of ground to cover before it could join the eu .
" it is now up to the council -lrb- of europe -rrb- and the presidency to decide the course to take .
i can tell you that the commission is ready to prepare an opinion on the candidacy of montenegro , " rehn had said when the montenegrin government first announced its intentions last thursday .
montenegrin growth a former yugoslav republic , montenegro has posted an average growth of eight percent since 2006 , when it ended its union with serbia .
montenegro already uses the euro , but is not a formal member of the euro zone .
it signed a stabilisation and association agreement with the eu in october 2007 .

some 74 percent of montenegrins say they belong to the orthodox church , with islam as the second largest religion at 18 percent .
the european commission is also said to be preparing itself for an eu bid from iceland .
the commission is " mentally prepared " for a membership proposal from iceland early in 2009 , and negotiations could be swift because the island state already has such close ties with europe , rehn said last week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .

some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party . the 52-year-old official was stabbed after answering the door of his home in a suburb of the bavarian city of passau on saturday , dec .
13 .
police on sunday said chief alois mannichl 's injuries were not life-threatening and that he was recovering . mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years and had become a target for hostility , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann said . the police chief told investigators the attacker , a 1.9 meter-tall -lrb- 6 foot , 4 inch -rrb- , bald man , wished him greetings from " the national resistance , " according to bavarian interior ministry spokesman oliver platzer . the two suspects taken into custody matched mannichl 's description , according to passau 's chief prosecutor , helmut walch , but were released after police found no proof of their involvement . " we are continuing to investigate further individuals from the far-right spectrum , " walch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannichl was known for taking a firm stance against far-right supporters the head of the police officers ' union , konrad freiberg , said the attack is part of a new strategy among neo-nazis to target police officers directly . " police are now being targeted by the far-right extremists , " he told the neue presse in hannover .
" in the past , there was still some regard for the police , but today , many are just focused on violence . " re-starting debate on npd ban if suspicions of neo-nazi responsibility for the attack prove true , it would represent an " escalation of violence " and " a completely new dimension of violence from the right , " bavarian interior minister herrmann said . while emphasizing that indications of a far-right attack needed to be confirmed , herrmann told the passauer neue presse that such violence should reignite discussions over banning the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . the head of a parliamentary home security committee , sebastian edathy , would support a ban , he told the neue osnabrücker zeitung on monday , as it would drastically restrict the sphere of activity within the far-right scene . but an interior expert from the free-market liberal fdp , max stadler , said that a ban on the npd would not prevent such attacks from occurring . the ndp has legislative seats in two of the 16 german states , but no representation at federal level . the bavarian interior ministry has said the number of crimes related to right-wing extremism in and around passau has more than doubled in the past year .
police has investigated 83 crimes so far in 2008 , compared to 40 in 2007 . there are around 31,000 members of extreme right-wing groups in germany , about 10,000 of whom are prepared to resort to violence , according to the office for the protection of the constitution . some 377 people were injured in attacks by right-wing extremists last year , said national police .
in all , there were 17,000 crimes with a right-wing extremist background .

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .

" by taking this step , montenegro commits itself to the accession process and the building of a united europe which is a strategic goal in which the founders of the european community invested their vision and commitment , " the government press office said earlier in a statement .

police on sunday said chief alois mannichl 's injuries were not life-threatening and that he was recovering . mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years and had become a target for hostility , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann said . the police chief told investigators the attacker , a 1.9 meter-tall -lrb- 6 foot , 4 inch -rrb- , bald man , wished him greetings from " the national resistance , " according to bavarian interior ministry spokesman oliver platzer . the two suspects taken into custody matched mannichl 's description , according to passau 's chief prosecutor , helmut walch , but were released after police found no proof of their involvement . " we are continuing to investigate further individuals from the far-right spectrum , " walch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannichl was known for taking a firm stance against far-right supporters the head of the police officers ' union , konrad freiberg , said the attack is part of a new strategy among neo-nazis to target police officers directly .

" in the past , there was still some regard for the police , but today , many are just focused on violence . " re-starting debate on npd ban if suspicions of neo-nazi responsibility for the attack prove true , it would represent an " escalation of violence " and " a completely new dimension of violence from the right , " bavarian interior minister herrmann said . while emphasizing that indications of a far-right attack needed to be confirmed , herrmann told the passauer neue presse that such violence should reignite discussions over banning the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . the head of a parliamentary home security committee , sebastian edathy , would support a ban , he told the neue osnabrücker zeitung on monday , as it would drastically restrict the sphere of activity within the far-right scene . but an interior expert from the free-market liberal fdp , max stadler , said that a ban on the npd would not prevent such attacks from occurring . the ndp has legislative seats in two of the 16 german states , but no representation at federal level . the bavarian interior ministry has said the number of crimes related to right-wing extremism in and around passau has more than doubled in the past year .
police has investigated 83 crimes so far in 2008 , compared to 40 in 2007 . there are around 31,000 members of extreme right-wing groups in germany , about 10,000 of whom are prepared to resort to violence , according to the office for the protection of the constitution . some 377 people were injured in attacks by right-wing extremists last year , said national police .
in all , there were 17,000 crimes with a right-wing extremist background .

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .

the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his wife and son were arrested a few days later .
the entire family is now being held in a detention center in berlin 's eastern outskirts .
reached by phone sunday , dec .
15 , liebl told german news agency dpa that he and his wife were on hunger strike in protest at the police action .
" it 's illegal what they have done , " he says .
" i 've done nothing wrong .
" i 'll fight the authorities all the way if their intention is to kick me and my family out of the country , " he says , adding that his son had been due to start school in berlin on monday .
liebl says the possibility that he and his family would be sent back to togo after 17 years was personally shocking .
" i 'm of german descent , " he insists .
" i 'm battling for the abolishment of racist colonial laws which are still valid today in togo . "
colonial origins liebl says his claim to german citizenship dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when togo was a german protectorate .
he says his late grandfather , german-born friedrich karl georg liebl , was a specialist in tropical diseases at a hospital in the togolese capital lome .
liebl says that while his grandfather was based in lome he had fallen in love with kokoe edith ajavon , the daughter of a local chieftain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl and his family could be forced to return to togo after 17 years in germany he says the couple had a son , johann baptist liebl , and were wedded in a traditional african-style tribal ceremony in togo .
mixed marriages were banned under german imperial law and johann was registered as a mixed-race child .
in 1911 , karl liebl returned home to straubing , bavaria , leaving his african bride and son behind in togo .
in 1962 , gerson liebl - the son of johann baptist - was born .
seeking asylum bright at school , gerson says he learned german and got a job as a goldsmith before flying to frankfurt in 1991 to seek asylum and later german citizenship .
this was when his long struggle with the german bureaucracy began in earnest , he says .
officials argued that gerson 's father , johann baptist , had never possessed german citizenship , nor did he qualify for it under colonial law .
ordered to leave the country , gerson liebl refused to comply .
police raided his apartment and during a scuffle liebl claimed he suffered injuries .
later he was given a nine-month suspended sentence for resisting arrest .
but it emerged that police had acted without an arrest warrant and the sentence against him was quashed .
eventually , liebl and his family were allowed to remain in germany , and he moved to straubing , where his grandfather had once lived .
case heard in germany 's highest court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liebl 's case was rejected in court but in 2005 liebl 's residence permit expired and was not extended due to a technicality .
he was also out of work .
he then raised his grievances with a german parliamentary committee set up to deal with foreigners ' grievances .
in straubing , town hall officials speak of liebl 's extraordinary tenacity in his legal battles and the rows of files relating to his case that line office bookshelves .
martin panten , the head of straubing 's foreigners ' affairs office , says that in the 13 years he 's been working there he has never known a case like liebl 's .
" he contests everything , " says panten .
on three occasions liebl has taken his case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
" that 's most unusual , " panten told german newspaper berliner zeitung .
while there is a degree of sympathy for liebl 's difficulties , straubing officials say there is nothing they can do to help him .
" we can not change the nation 's laws .
only the bundestag -lrb- the german parliament -rrb- can do that , " panten says .
but in march this year , bavaria 's highest administrative court rejected liebl 's latest bid to remain in the country and receive german citizenship .
his 17-year tussle with german officialdom appearing to have come to a sad end , liebl says he has no other choice but to embark on his hunger strike in the hope it will push government authorities to re-evaluate his claim to live in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "

to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .

but because of the billions of stars which lie between earth and the hub of the galaxy , it has been impossible to view what was actually there .
now , german researchers say they have established the existence of an enormous black hole at the galaxy 's center " beyond any reasonable doubt , " dpa news agency reported on monday , dec .
15 .
the scientists at the max-planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching , near munich , conducted 16 years of studies on 28 stars circling the center of the milky way .
by observing the movements of these stars , the scientists say they were able to determine the characteristics of the object around which they are circling .
" undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long-term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said max planck study leader professor reinhard genzel .
" the stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of 4 million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . "
breaking through dust clouds bildunterschrift : dust clouds like this one have prevented scientists from viewing the galaxy 's center the astronomers were also able to measure with great accuracy how far the earth is from the center of the galaxy - a distance of 27,000 light years .
to overcome the age-old problem of penetrating the stellar dust and glare from billions of stars between earth and the center of the galaxy , the german astronomers focused on infrared light wavelengths that can penetrate the dust clouds .
the galaxy 's central mass , long suspected of being a giant black hole , is known as " sagittarius a star . "
the european southern observatory study , which began in 1992 , was made using the 3.5 meter new technology telescope at the la silla observatory and the very large telescope - an array of four 8.2-meter telescopes at the paranal observatory .
both operate from the atacama desert in chile .
the research is published in the astrophysical journal . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 .
" we are aware that we are now facing a phase that will be difficult , but we are ready to work with our partners and deal with all the challenges that we will encounter , " djukanovic said .
" by taking this step , montenegro commits itself to the accession process and the building of a united europe which is a strategic goal in which the founders of the european community invested their vision and commitment , " the government press office said earlier in a statement .
the move by podgorica is expected to add impetus to eu membership bids by other balkan states such as albania and serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro recently split from serbia djukanovic also met in paris with eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who had gone on record last week saying that montenegro still had a lot of ground to cover before it could join the eu .

some 74 percent of montenegrins say they belong to the orthodox church , with islam as the second largest religion at 18 percent .
the european commission is also said to be preparing itself for an eu bid from iceland .
the commission is " mentally prepared " for a membership proposal from iceland early in 2009 , and negotiations could be swift because the island state already has such close ties with europe , rehn said last week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john varley 's warning comes ahead of the latest uk unemployment figures on wednesday , where the number of jobless is expected to rise sharply .
a new survey suggests household debt is on the increase , and the value of sterling has fallen against the euro .
house prices have already fallen by 15 % this year , and his remarks suggest they may fall at the same rate next year .
john varley , group chief executive of barclays , painted a bleak outlook in an interview on sky news , during which he criticised mortgage borrowing levels over the last decade .
i think an additional 700,000 people unemployed over the course of the next 12 months is certainly possible to contemplate john varley uk house prices in detail he warned the uk was only " halfway " through the slump with house prices set for even greater falls .
he said : " our view was that from the top to the bottom , you would see a fall of something like 25 to 30 % .
" i suspect we 're about halfway through that at the moment .
i mean that slowdown , the negative house price inflation started in 2007 , it 's accelerated in 2008 .
" we 're probably about halfway through that period , so in other words we 've got another 10 to 15 % to fall between now and the end of next year .
that would be our assessment . "
his bleak prediction extended into the jobs market .
he said : " our view is that unemployment will rise .
unemployment is likely to go north of 7 % over the course of the next 12 months or so , it might be as high as 7.5 % .
" i think an additional 700,000 people unemployed over the course of the next 12 months is certainly possible to contemplate . "
mr varley was speaking ahead of the release , on wednesday , of the latest uk unemployment figures .
the number of jobless could rise sharply , with some forecasters warning the total of those out of work might hit two million or more .
debt increase meanwhile , a survey commissioned by the bank of england has suggested an increase in the number of households struggling with debt .
many said they had less to spend after paying household bills and had saved less than they expected .
nearly 2,500 households were interviewed for the survey in late september and early october .
more respondents were finding their debts to be a burden than in any similar survey since the mid 1990s .
the bank says after a period of growth and low inflation , it has seen an abrupt change in the circumstances facing british households .
sterling 's lows international investors ' lack of confidence in the uk economy has seen the the pound hitting new lows against the euro : last week one pound bought as little as 1.11 euros , the lowest ever .
but the government appears to have ruled out action to shore up sterling .
on sunday the chief secretary to the treasury , yvette cooper , told the bbc the government was not planning to step in to support the pound .
she said attempts by previous administrations to target exchange rates had been unsuccessful .
instead the government would continue to try to keep inflation under control and support the economy , she said .
" we have never had a policy of targeting the pound .
our policy has been to target inflation and that , i think , has been the right way .
it has paid off over the last 10 or 11 years . "
huge deficits but the government has been warned that any action it takes to support the uk economy must not break eu rules .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet told the financial times that the eu 's " stability and growth " pact must not be allowed to fall apart .
the pact has rules designed to stop eu member states from racking up huge budget deficits and national debt in order to boost their economies .
" we would destroy confidence if we blew up the pact , " he said .
mr trichet is said to be worried that fiscal indiscipline - such as governments printing large amounts of currency in order to boost spending - could threaten " already fragile " economic confidence .

john varley 's warning comes ahead of the latest uk unemployment figures on wednesday , where the number of jobless is expected to rise sharply .
a new survey suggests household debt is on the increase , and the value of sterling has fallen against the euro .
house prices have already fallen by 15 % this year , and his remarks suggest they may fall at the same rate next year .
john varley , group chief executive of barclays , painted a bleak outlook in an interview on sky news , during which he criticised mortgage borrowing levels over the last decade . "
i think an additional 700,000 people unemployed over the course of the next 12 months is certainly possible to contemplate " john varley uk house prices in detail he warned the uk was only " halfway " through the slump with house prices set for even greater falls .
he said : " our view was that from the top to the bottom , you would see a fall of something like 25 to 30 % .
" i suspect we 're about halfway through that at the moment .
i mean that slowdown , the negative house price inflation started in 2007 , it 's accelerated in 2008 .
" we 're probably about halfway through that period , so in other words we 've got another 10 to 15 % to fall between now and the end of next year .
that would be our assessment . "
his bleak prediction extended into the jobs market .
he said : " our view is that unemployment will rise .
unemployment is likely to go north of 7 % over the course of the next 12 months or so , it might be as high as 7.5 % .
" i think an additional 700,000 people unemployed over the course of the next 12 months is certainly possible to contemplate . "
mr varley was speaking ahead of the release , on wednesday , of the latest uk unemployment figures .
the number of jobless could rise sharply , with some forecasters warning the total of those out of work might hit two million or more .
debt increase meanwhile , a survey commissioned by the bank of england has suggested an increase in the number of households struggling with debt .
many said they had less to spend after paying household bills and had saved less than they expected .
nearly 2,500 households were interviewed for the survey in late september and early october .
more respondents were finding their debts to be a burden than in any similar survey since the mid 1990s .
the bank says after a period of growth and low inflation , it has seen an abrupt change in the circumstances facing british households .
sterling 's lows international investors ' lack of confidence in the uk economy has seen the the pound hitting new lows against the euro : last week one pound bought as little as 1.11 euros , the lowest ever .
but the government appears to have ruled out action to shore up sterling .
on sunday the chief secretary to the treasury , yvette cooper , told the bbc the government was not planning to step in to support the pound .
she said attempts by previous administrations to target exchange rates had been unsuccessful .
instead the government would continue to try to keep inflation under control and support the economy , she said .
" we have never had a policy of targeting the pound .
our policy has been to target inflation and that , i think , has been the right way .
it has paid off over the last 10 or 11 years . "
huge deficits but the government has been warned that any action it takes to support the uk economy must not break eu rules .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet told the financial times that the eu 's " stability and growth " pact must not be allowed to fall apart .
the pact has rules designed to stop eu member states from racking up huge budget deficits and national debt in order to boost their economies .
" we would destroy confidence if we blew up the pact , " he said .
mr trichet is said to be worried that fiscal indiscipline - such as governments printing large amounts of currency in order to boost spending - could threaten " already fragile " economic confidence .

advertisement susan muir explains how cognitive behavioural therapy helped her more people with eating disorders could benefit from " talking therapies " which aim to release them from obsessive feelings , say uk researchers .
they said a specially-created form of enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy might work in four out of five cases .
a 154-person american journal of psychiatry study , by the university of oxford , found most achieved " complete and lasting " improvement .
currently , the treatment is officially recommended only for bulimia patients .
now , for the first time , we have a single treatment which can be effective at treating the majority of cases professor christopher fairburn oxford university some statistics suggest that more than a million people in the uk are affected by some kind of eating disorder , the best known types being anorexia nervosa and bulimia .
approximately 40 % of those with eating disorders have bulimia , 20 % have anorexia , and the remainder have " atypical disorders " , which can combine both bulimic and anorexic-type symptoms .
the national institute of clinical excellence has backed cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia , but professor christopher fairburn , the wellcome trust funded researcher who led the project , believes his version could help many more people .
his study focused on bulimia and " atypical " patients , but excluded those with anorexia .
the technique works using a series of counselling sessions which help the person involved to realise the links between their emotions and behaviour , and work out ways to change what they are doing .
self-esteem professor fairburn developed two versions specifically for people with eating disorders , one which focused completely on the eating problems , and another , which took a wider view of not only the eating disorder , but also problems with self-esteem which might be contributing to it .
both treatments involved 50-minute outpatient sessions repeated once a week for 20 weeks .
afterwards , the researchers found most patients had responded well , and that this improvement was maintained over the next year - a time during which relapse into eating disorder is most likely to occur .
two-thirds made a " complete and lasting " response , with many of the other third showing substantial improvement .
although the study did not specifically include people with anorexia , a second study , currently underway , is showing promising results in this group .
no hospital professor fairburn said : " now , for the first time , we have a single treatment which can be effective at treating the majority of cases , without the need for patients to be admitted into hospital .
" it is increasingly being used across the nhs , and has the potential to improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people living with eating disorders . "
susan muir is one person who says that cbt techniques have helped free her of a long-term eating disorder .
the 39-year-old , from chesterfield , used diet and exercise to shed 13 stone , but found that once this had happened , she found herself binge-eating then obsessively exercising .
" the cbt helped me realise what i was doing , and turned those irrational thoughts into rational ones .
" it really helped me deal with my self-esteem problems and made me feel very positive . "
susan ringwood , the chief executive of beat , the eating disorders campaign group , said : " this research shows that people can benefit from psychological therapy even at a very low weight .
" there has been so little research into eating disorders and anorexia in particular , and this has really added to our knowledge in a challenging field . "
dr alan cohen , mental health spokesperson for the royal college of gps , welcomed the research .
he said : " access to this service , and appropriate training for therapists to deliver this new form of treatment , is very important . "

advertisement susan muir explains how cognitive behavioural therapy helped her more people with eating disorders could benefit from " talking therapies " which aim to release them from obsessive feelings , say uk researchers .
they said a specially-created form of enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy might work in four out of five cases .
a 154-person american journal of psychiatry study , by the university of oxford , found most achieved " complete and lasting " improvement .
currently , the treatment is officially recommended only for bulimia patients .
now , for the first time , we have a single treatment which can be effective at treating the majority of cases professor christopher fairburn oxford university some statistics suggest that more than a million people in the uk are affected by some kind of eating disorder , the best known types being anorexia nervosa and bulimia .
approximately 40 % of those with eating disorders have bulimia , 20 % have anorexia , and the remainder have " atypical disorders " , which can combine both bulimic and anorexic-type symptoms .
the national institute of clinical excellence has backed cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia , but professor christopher fairburn , the wellcome trust funded researcher who led the project , believes his version could help many more people .
his study focused on bulimia and " atypical " patients , but excluded those with anorexia .
the technique works using a series of counselling sessions which help the person involved to realise the links between their emotions and behaviour , and work out ways to change what they are doing .
self-esteem professor fairburn developed two versions specifically for people with eating disorders , one which focused completely on the eating problems , and another , which took a wider view of not only the eating disorder , but also problems with self-esteem which might be contributing to it .
both treatments involved 50-minute outpatient sessions repeated once a week for 20 weeks .
afterwards , the researchers found most patients had responded well , and that this improvement was maintained over the next year - a time during which relapse into eating disorder is most likely to occur .
two-thirds made a " complete and lasting " response , with many of the other third showing substantial improvement .
although the study did not specifically include people with anorexia , a second study , currently underway , is showing promising results in this group .
no hospital professor fairburn said : " now , for the first time , we have a single treatment which can be effective at treating the majority of cases , without the need for patients to be admitted into hospital .
" it is increasingly being used across the nhs , and has the potential to improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people living with eating disorders . "
susan muir is one person who says that cbt techniques have helped free her of a long-term eating disorder .
the 39-year-old , from chesterfield , used diet and exercise to shed 13 stone , but found that once this had happened , she found herself binge-eating then obsessively exercising .
" the cbt helped me realise what i was doing , and turned those irrational thoughts into rational ones .
" it really helped me deal with my self-esteem problems and made me feel very positive . "
susan ringwood , the chief executive of beat , the eating disorders campaign group , said : " this research shows that people can benefit from psychological therapy even at a very low weight .
" there has been so little research into eating disorders and anorexia in particular , and this has really added to our knowledge in a challenging field . "
dr alan cohen , mental health spokesperson for the royal college of gps , welcomed the research .
he said : " access to this service , and appropriate training for therapists to deliver this new form of treatment , is very important . "

rhod gilbert tries coasteering to show one of the activities wales has to offer the strength of the euro and the credit crunch could boost welsh tourism as people shun expensive foreign holidays , industry leaders will be told later .
the welsh assembly government 's tourism summit in gwynedd will be shown a new advertisement for the home market .
the 40 second advert will be on tv and , for the first time , in cinemas .
heritage minister alun ffred jones said people wanted " real value and authentic quality , not over indulgence and ostentation " .
he added ahead of the conference in caernarfon : " this change in holidays is set against the backdrop of economic uncertainty .
" this is likely to make the market think harder and differently about their holidays choices , we could see a substitution of more expensive foreign holidays to uk holidays . "
the value of sterling has dropped 13 % against the euro in the last two months .
the advert for holidays in wales will be shown in cinemas and on tv it has had knock-on effect on british tourists looking to take holidays abroad but welsh tourism chiefs are hoping to take advantage .
comedian and radio presenter rhod gilbert is the star of the campaign , which includes web films that will also be hosted on video sharing websites .
during the films he is shown getting involved in raft building and coasteering , taking a cookery lesson and sampling wine at a vineyard in wales .
it is part of a £ 2.2m investment in tourism marketing from the assembly government .
around two million leaflets will be distributed from january to march to previous visitors to wales and to potential new visitors through newspapers .
rhod gilbert said : " hopefully , the ads will do the same for other people as they did for me - remind them how beautiful wales is , open their eyes to how much more there is to do nowadays , and make them want to visit again and again . "
conservative heritage spokesman paul davies am said " proper investment and a proper strategy " were critical .
" the weakness of the pound and the looming recession are forcing more people to consider holidaying at home , " he said .
" we have long held concerns that the abolition of the wales tourist board has had a damaging effect on our ability to market wales as a leading tourism destination " .

rhod gilbert tries coasteering to show one of the activities wales has to offer the strength of the euro and the credit crunch could boost welsh tourism as people shun expensive foreign holidays , industry leaders will be told later .
the welsh assembly government 's tourism summit in gwynedd will be shown a new advertisement for the home market .
the 40 second advert will be on tv and , for the first time , in cinemas .
heritage minister alun ffred jones said people wanted " real value and authentic quality , not over indulgence and ostentation " .
he added ahead of the conference in caernarfon : " this change in holidays is set against the backdrop of economic uncertainty .
" this is likely to make the market think harder and differently about their holidays choices , we could see a substitution of more expensive foreign holidays to uk holidays . "
the value of sterling has dropped 13 % against the euro in the last two months .
the advert for holidays in wales will be shown in cinemas and on tv it has had knock-on effect on british tourists looking to take holidays abroad but welsh tourism chiefs are hoping to take advantage .
comedian and radio presenter rhod gilbert is the star of the campaign , which includes web films that will also be hosted on video sharing websites .
during the films he is shown getting involved in raft building and coasteering , taking a cookery lesson and sampling wine at a vineyard in wales .
it is part of a £ 2.2m investment in tourism marketing from the assembly government .
around two million leaflets will be distributed from january to march to previous visitors to wales and to potential new visitors through newspapers .
rhod gilbert said : " hopefully , the ads will do the same for other people as they did for me - remind them how beautiful wales is , open their eyes to how much more there is to do nowadays , and make them want to visit again and again . "
conservative heritage spokesman paul davies am said " proper investment and a proper strategy " were critical .
" the weakness of the pound and the looming recession are forcing more people to consider holidaying at home , " he said .
" we have long held concerns that the abolition of the wales tourist board has had a damaging effect on our ability to market wales as a leading tourism destination " .
