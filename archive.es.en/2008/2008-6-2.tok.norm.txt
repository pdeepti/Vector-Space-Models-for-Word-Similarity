learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .

that is really one of the problems seriously affecting the african continent – and são tomé and príncipe is no exception .
i hope that you will take up subjects like these in the next series of learning by ear to communicate these messages further , particularly in africa . "
-lrb- adilson castro , budo-budo , são tomé and príncipe -rrb- " i find the new series of learning by ear radio dramas very apt – because here in angola we ’ ve seen a great deal of environmental destruction , even though our nation is wealthy compared to other african countries .
i am convinced that learning is the key : with educated young people , the future is in safe hands . "
-lrb- figueiredo cassinda , huambo , angola -rrb- " before the presentation of the learning by ear episode , on how to process polythene waste and the bad effects on the environment , that improper disposal causes , i presumed that there is nothing which is not degradable , once buried in the soil .
sincerely , this programme is entertaining and really satisfying us .

with our shows , listeners can meet the people who shape it as well as those affected by it . learning by ear shows how globalization lifts people out of poverty and how others sink even deeper because of it .
when globalization critics from all over the world met in nairobi for the 2007 world social forum , they came with a clear message : globalization is one of the major causes for underdevelopment and poverty in africa .
however , western governments and international financial institutions like the world bank and the international monetary fund insist that africa must open its markets and increase trade with the western world in order to grow economically .
different faces learning by ear does not join in the battle .
instead , the shows analyze the different faces of globalization in africa .
our reporters speak with people who have left their homes in search of a better life in africa ’ s cities and even in europe .
they introduce listeners to african entrepreneurs who benefit from a globalized economy and they take a look at how the backbone of africa ’ s economy , agriculture , is changing under the influence of globalization . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .
learning by ear is supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office .

the first deutsche welle global media forum seeks to create an international dialogue on these issues during a conference this week in bonn , germany . the genocide in sudan , civil war in zimbabwe , human rights abuses in burma or tibet are examples of violence and repressions brought to our attention thanks to the efforts of a free media .
engaged and courageous journalists expose and denounce these types of injustice .
every day , around the world , they are forming the knowledge of our globe .
what exactly can and should media do ?
what dangers come with peacebuilding and conflict prevention ?
these and other questions were discussed at the first deutsche welle global media forum , which started monday , june 2 .
getting to the heart of the story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a free press reports on painful issues such as the use of child soldiers profound sadness and wild determination are mixed in the face of a possibly 12-year-old girl .
next to her braided hair a kalashnikov sat ready .
the journalist peter mantello risked his life to fotograph this child soldier in burma .
the military regime in the asian country does not look kindly on such photos being published and after the recent deadly cyclone restricted press efforts to report from the devestated zone .
mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "
for more than two days about 800 journalists , politicians , academics and cultural figures from around the world will discuss media issues .
the theme " peacebuilding and conflict prevention " could not have been more timely as two deutsche welle journalists were recently killed in afghanistan .
but the conference in bonn is about dialogue , not navel gazing .
" the role of journalism and the media must be discussed and defined .
that goes equally for peacebuilding and crisis prevention , governance and human rights , civil society and transmission of values , education and development , " said deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann .
no democracy without free press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european soldiers take part in peacekeeping missions what is europe doing about the crises in the world ?
this question is at the center of congressional debates .
for some time , crisis prevention has been one of the four basic components of the eu 's foreign policy .
the european union has undertaken plenty of peace missions .
it had soldiers take part in united nations peacekeeping missions to helmets safeguarded elections in congo .
eu police monitored the border between egypt and the gaza strip .
eu forces were involved in helping build security and legal institutions in the balkans , afghanistan and in former communist countries .
but there is still a lot which needs to be done , said georg boomgarden , state secretary for the german foreign office .
" journalism is holy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirin ebadi said journalism is a holy calling iranian nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi spoke during the conference 's opening day .
" when violence is detected , the human conscience is also awakened , " ebadi said .
" there you can find an answer .
journalistic work is both a dangerous and a holy job . "
deutsche welle broadcasts from central europe around the world via radio , television and internet .
even so , two-thirds of people live in countries where free press and media freedom remain foreign words .
deutsche welle journalists help to build free media outlets – such as after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan .
the deutsche welle global media forum will take place regularly in bonn .
the main agenda items will change , but the event will always address ways to cope with challenges which are largely influenced by the global media . stefan dege -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

next to her braided hair a kalashnikov sat ready .
the journalist peter mantello risked his life to fotograph this child soldier in burma .
the military regime in the asian country does not look kindly on such photos being published and after the recent deadly cyclone restricted press efforts to report from the devestated zone .
mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "
for more than two days about 800 journalists , politicians , academics and cultural figures from around the world will discuss media issues .
the theme " peacebuilding and conflict prevention " could not have been more timely as two deutsche welle journalists were recently killed in afghanistan .
but the conference in bonn is about dialogue , not navel gazing .
" the role of journalism and the media must be discussed and defined .
that goes equally for peacebuilding and crisis prevention , governance and human rights , civil society and transmission of values , education and development , " said deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann .
no democracy without free press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european soldiers take part in peacekeeping missions what is europe doing about the crises in the world ?
this question is at the center of congressional debates .
for some time , crisis prevention has been one of the four basic components of the eu 's foreign policy .
the european union has undertaken plenty of peace missions .
it had soldiers take part in united nations peacekeeping missions to helmets safeguarded elections in congo .
eu police monitored the border between egypt and the gaza strip .
eu forces were involved in helping build security and legal institutions in the balkans , afghanistan and in former communist countries .
but there is still a lot which needs to be done , said georg boomgarden , state secretary for the german foreign office .
" journalism is holy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirin ebadi said journalism is a holy calling iranian nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi spoke during the conference 's opening day .
" when violence is detected , the human conscience is also awakened , " ebadi said .
" there you can find an answer .
journalistic work is both a dangerous and a holy job . "
deutsche welle broadcasts from central europe around the world via radio , television and internet .
even so , two-thirds of people live in countries where free press and media freedom remain foreign words .
deutsche welle journalists help to build free media outlets – such as after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan .
the deutsche welle global media forum will take place regularly in bonn .
the main agenda items will change , but the event will always address ways to cope with challenges which are largely influenced by the global media . stefan dege -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : player interviews germany 's marcell jansen : " we 're unified with our fans " russia 's ivan saenko : " russia is n't looking too far ahead " soccer star mladen petric : " we are n't under any pressure " austria 's martin harnik : " austria wants to be a successful host " euro 2008 -pipe- 02.06.2008 greece 's angelos charisteas : " we are better than in 2004 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charisteas is a favorite with colleagues and fans alike after his euro 2004 heroics as part of an ongoing series of interviews ahead of euro 2008 , angelos charisteas , the greek forward of fc nuremberg , told dw that his countrymen are better prepared to win in 2008 than they were four years ago . greece achieved its greatest soccer success - winning the 2004 european championship title - thanks to goals by 28 year old angelos charisteas . in the quarter finals against france he scored the decisive goalin the 1-0 win , and then put the winner into the net against the hosts portugal in the final .
not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .

engaged and courageous journalists expose and denounce these types of injustice .
every day , around the world , they are forming the knowledge of our globe .
what exactly can and should media do ?
what dangers come with peacebuilding and conflict prevention ?
these and other questions were discussed at the first deutsche welle global media forum , which started monday , june 2 .
getting to the heart of the story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a free press reports on painful issues such as the use of child soldiers profound sadness and wild determination are mixed in the face of a possibly 12-year-old girl .
next to her braided hair a kalashnikov sat ready .
the journalist peter mantello risked his life to fotograph this child soldier in burma .
the military regime in the asian country does not look kindly on such photos being published and after the recent deadly cyclone restricted press efforts to report from the devestated zone .
mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "
for more than two days about 800 journalists , politicians , academics and cultural figures from around the world will discuss media issues .
the theme " peacebuilding and conflict prevention " could not have been more timely as two deutsche welle journalists were recently killed in afghanistan .
but the conference in bonn is about dialogue , not navel gazing .
" the role of journalism and the media must be discussed and defined .
that goes equally for peacebuilding and crisis prevention , governance and human rights , civil society and transmission of values , education and development , " said deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann .
no democracy without free press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european soldiers take part in peacekeeping missions what is europe doing about the crises in the world ?
this question is at the center of congressional debates .
for some time , crisis prevention has been one of the four basic components of the eu 's foreign policy .
the european union has undertaken plenty of peace missions .
it had soldiers take part in united nations peacekeeping missions to helmets safeguarded elections in congo .
eu police monitored the border between egypt and the gaza strip .
eu forces were involved in helping build security and legal institutions in the balkans , afghanistan and in former communist countries .
but there is still a lot which needs to be done , said georg boomgarden , state secretary for the german foreign office .
" journalism is holy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirin ebadi said journalism is a holy calling iranian nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi spoke during the conference 's opening day .
" when violence is detected , the human conscience is also awakened , " ebadi said .
" there you can find an answer .
journalistic work is both a dangerous and a holy job . "
deutsche welle broadcasts from central europe around the world via radio , television and internet .
even so , two-thirds of people live in countries where free press and media freedom remain foreign words .
deutsche welle journalists help to build free media outlets – such as after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan .
the deutsche welle global media forum will take place regularly in bonn .
the main agenda items will change , but the event will always address ways to cope with challenges which are largely influenced by the global media . stefan dege -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .
" we must make sure that biofuel production does not compete with crop cultivation , that it does not interfere with the need to produce food , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 02.06.2008 german minister under fire over telekom spying scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is self-regulation the answer when companies break laws ?
the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed . germany 's top managers have not been showing themselves in the best light of late .
recent months have seen one disreputable incident after another .
the head of germany 's postal service deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , stepped down after coming under investigation for tax evasion .
volkswagen was engulfed in a scandal after it was revealed that managers and supervisory board members had slept with prostitutes at the company 's expense .
discount supermarket lidl has admitted keeping their staff under video surveillance , while the german electronics giant siemens has acknowledged paying more than a million euros in bribes to secure foreign contracts . now deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications company , has admitted tracking communications between journalists and staff members .
an illicit attempt to end internal warfare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-experte karl zawadzky , deutsches programm , wirtschaft for years , leading executives at telekom have been at war with one another .
leaks to the press have been one weapon in their armory .
the former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke described the company as having as many " holes as swiss cheese ” .
of course , there are such things as company secrets and it is only natural that the executive board should attempt to protect confidentiality .
but if board directors and supervisory board members pass on information themselves in a bid to damage one another , then their company has a problem .
nonetheless , that does not justify breaking the law .
this is precisely what happened at deutsche telekom .
in order to find out where the leaks were coming from , a system was set up to spy on journalists and management and supervisory board members .
no one admits giving the scheme the go-ahead .
but telephone and internet data was clearly analyzed to find out who was communicating with whom .
this is a fact .
equally indisputable is that a spy was planted in a newspaper office . in addition , state prosecutors are investigating the possibility that people 's movements were tracked using cellphone data in order to find out who was meeting whom .
it is even suspected that online bank accounts came under scrutiny .
a loss in credibility for telekom ten telekom managers are currently under investigation , including former board chairman ricke and supervisory board chairman klaus zumwinkel .
all deny any wrongdoing .
whoever was responsible for the snooping scandal has dealt a massive blow to the company .
all telecommunications companies should be able to guarantee the confidentiality of telephone conversations and other private data .
no one wants to have anything to do with a telephone , cellphone or online services provider that does not respect confidentiality or the rule of law .
even though current ceo rene obermann called in the prosecutors and the accused have since left the company , the damage remains .
the german government 's calls for the telecommunications sector to agree to a data protection code of conduct will also not achieve much .
existing legislation is clear and quite sufficient .
if managers think that they are above the law and can do as they please , the only thing to do is to thoroughly investigate the matter , introduce transparency , and punish those involved . karl zawadzky -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when it 's soccer .
but wait .
it 's the same game with the same rules .
so does it really matter what the sport is called ? someone once wrote that " a rose by any other name is still a rose . "
but what if that rose was a sport and that sport was football .
would football still be the same sport if it went by a different name ?
well , it does and when you look at it , it does n't make a lot of difference whether you call that sport " football " or " soccer . " except to a lot of people it does make a lot of difference .
which raises the question , why does it matter so much if a game , with the same set of rules and regulations applied regardless of moniker , is called one thing or the other ? the debate over whether " the beautiful game " should be called football or soccer seems to have been drawn up over national lines .
despite the fact that a version of the game was being played in china 3000 years ago , england is widely regarded as being the birthplace of the modern game we now call football … or soccer .
for the english , the game is most definitely called football . and this is where it starts to get interesting - and complicated . the game has been played in england since the middle ages .
it is unlikely that it had a name at that point as those involved were probably less concerned with what it was called and more worried about surviving the matches which often lasted longer than a day . early " fute-ball " nearly did n't make it to become " football " back then kicking , punching , biting and gouging were allowed and such was the ferocity of the game that king edward iii passed laws in 1331 to try and outlaw the game . in scotland , king james i , proclaimed in parliament in 1424 , " that na man play at the fute-ball " -lrb- no man shall play football -rrb- – which is one of the first recorded uses of the word associated with the sport . a good 400 years passed before the game gained enough credibility to be recognized as an official sport in england .
the football association -lrb- fa -rrb- was formed in london in october 1863 in an attempt to standardize the rules of the game which they called " association football . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blame for the term " soccer " sits firmly with the upper classes twenty-six years later , fed up with shouting out " hey lads , fancy a game of association football ? " public school and university students , most notably at oxford , began shortening the cumbersome title to " socca " and by 1895 the word had been reworked into " soccer . " " socca " phrase coined by english elite so far from being a totally unacceptable and derogatory word for football , the word soccer actually developed from some of the most privileged and highly educated minds in the country . back in the 1600s , the game of " fute-ball " was starting to cause mayhem in the colonies .
kick-abouts have been recorded at the original jamestown settlement in the united states as far back as 1609 . even before the forming of the fa in london , students at harvard and princeton were playing the game known as " football " in annual contests which began in 1827 , before forming their own small leagues in 1840 . invention of american football puts the us in a quandry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football played with the hands ?
not technically football .
when the americans developed rugby into their own brand of hand-held football in the late 1800s , they found themselves in a dilemma .
there was already a game called " football " - the one those princeton and harvard boys enjoyed so much . to call the physical contact sport that they had just developed " football " would cause massive confusion .
imagine organizing a game of " football " only to have one team turn up in helmets and pads , not to mention the confusion future generations of " football moms " would have . so the americans adopted the word the english elite had fashioned to determine between the rugby derivative and association football .
soccer , perversely , became the game you played with your feet , while football remained the sport in which you used your hands . both terms are english names for the same sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a football or a soccer ball ?
when it comes down to it then , it 's all a matter of personal taste .
the english fans who champion the cause of football over soccer because " they play soccer in the us and football in england " are right but only in the literal sense .
both are the english terms for the same sport and those who argue that " soccer " is an american term and therefore an insult to the english game are misguided . for the americans , their brand of " football " is really nothing of the sort and if anything should be called " american rugby " . but really , when all is said and done - it 's just a game .

when it 's soccer .
but wait .
it 's the same game with the same rules .
so does it really matter what the sport is called ? someone once wrote that " a rose by any other name is still a rose . "
but what if that rose was a sport and that sport was football .
would football still be the same sport if it went by a different name ?
well , it does and when you look at it , it does n't make a lot of difference whether you call that sport " football " or " soccer . " except to a lot of people it does make a lot of difference .
which raises the question , why does it matter so much if a game , with the same set of rules and regulations applied regardless of moniker , is called one thing or the other ? the debate over whether " the beautiful game " should be called football or soccer seems to have been drawn up over national lines .
despite the fact that a version of the game was being played in china 3000 years ago , england is widely regarded as being the birthplace of the modern game we now call football … or soccer .
for the english , the game is most definitely called football . and this is where it starts to get interesting - and complicated . the game has been played in england since the middle ages .
it is unlikely that it had a name at that point as those involved were probably less concerned with what it was called and more worried about surviving the matches which often lasted longer than a day . early " fute-ball " nearly did n't make it to become " football " back then kicking , punching , biting and gouging were allowed and such was the ferocity of the game that king edward iii passed laws in 1331 to try and outlaw the game . in scotland , king james i , proclaimed in parliament in 1424 , " that na man play at the fute-ball " -lrb- no man shall play football -rrb- – which is one of the first recorded uses of the word associated with the sport . a good 400 years passed before the game gained enough credibility to be recognized as an official sport in england .
the football association -lrb- fa -rrb- was formed in london in october 1863 in an attempt to standardize the rules of the game which they called " association football . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blame for the term " soccer " sits firmly with the upper classes twenty-six years later , fed up with shouting out " hey lads , fancy a game of association football ? " public school and university students , most notably at oxford , began shortening the cumbersome title to " socca " and by 1895 the word had been reworked into " soccer . " " socca " phrase coined by english elite so far from being a totally unacceptable and derogatory word for football , the word soccer actually developed from some of the most privileged and highly educated minds in the country . back in the 1600s , the game of " fute-ball " was starting to cause mayhem in the colonies .
kick-abouts have been recorded at the original jamestown settlement in the united states as far back as 1609 . even before the forming of the fa in london , students at harvard and princeton were playing the game known as " football " in annual contests which began in 1827 , before forming their own small leagues in 1840 . invention of american football puts the us in a quandry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football played with the hands ?
not technically football .
when the americans developed rugby into their own brand of hand-held football in the late 1800s , they found themselves in a dilemma .
there was already a game called " football " - the one those princeton and harvard boys enjoyed so much . to call the physical contact sport that they had just developed " football " would cause massive confusion .
imagine organizing a game of " football " only to have one team turn up in helmets and pads , not to mention the confusion future generations of " football moms " would have . so the americans adopted the word the english elite had fashioned to determine between the rugby derivative and association football .
soccer , perversely , became the game you played with your feet , while football remained the sport in which you used your hands . both terms are english names for the same sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a football or a soccer ball ?
when it comes down to it then , it 's all a matter of personal taste .
the english fans who champion the cause of football over soccer because " they play soccer in the us and football in england " are right but only in the literal sense .
both are the english terms for the same sport and those who argue that " soccer " is an american term and therefore an insult to the english game are misguided . for the americans , their brand of " football " is really nothing of the sort and if anything should be called " american rugby " . but really , when all is said and done - it 's just a game .

when it 's soccer .
but wait .
it 's the same game with the same rules .
so does it really matter what the sport is called ? someone once wrote that " a rose by any other name is still a rose . "
but what if that rose was a sport and that sport was football .
would football still be the same sport if it went by a different name ?
well , it does and when you look at it , it does n't make a lot of difference whether you call that sport " football " or " soccer . " except to a lot of people it does make a lot of difference .
which raises the question , why does it matter so much if a game , with the same set of rules and regulations applied regardless of moniker , is called one thing or the other ? the debate over whether " the beautiful game " should be called football or soccer seems to have been drawn up over national lines .
despite the fact that a version of the game was being played in china 3000 years ago , england is widely regarded as being the birthplace of the modern game we now call football … or soccer .
for the english , the game is most definitely called football . and this is where it starts to get interesting - and complicated . the game has been played in england since the middle ages .
it is unlikely that it had a name at that point as those involved were probably less concerned with what it was called and more worried about surviving the matches which often lasted longer than a day . early " fute-ball " nearly did n't make it to become " football " back then kicking , punching , biting and gouging were allowed and such was the ferocity of the game that king edward iii passed laws in 1331 to try and outlaw the game . in scotland , king james i , proclaimed in parliament in 1424 , " that na man play at the fute-ball " -lrb- no man shall play football -rrb- – which is one of the first recorded uses of the word associated with the sport . a good 400 years passed before the game gained enough credibility to be recognized as an official sport in england .
the football association -lrb- fa -rrb- was formed in london in october 1863 in an attempt to standardize the rules of the game which they called " association football . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blame for the term " soccer " sits firmly with the upper classes twenty-six years later , fed up with shouting out " hey lads , fancy a game of association football ? " public school and university students , most notably at oxford , began shortening the cumbersome title to " socca " and by 1895 the word had been reworked into " soccer . " " socca " phrase coined by english elite so far from being a totally unacceptable and derogatory word for football , the word soccer actually developed from some of the most privileged and highly educated minds in the country . back in the 1600s , the game of " fute-ball " was starting to cause mayhem in the colonies .
kick-abouts have been recorded at the original jamestown settlement in the united states as far back as 1609 . even before the forming of the fa in london , students at harvard and princeton were playing the game known as " football " in annual contests which began in 1827 , before forming their own small leagues in 1840 . invention of american football puts the us in a quandry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football played with the hands ?
not technically football .
when the americans developed rugby into their own brand of hand-held football in the late 1800s , they found themselves in a dilemma .
there was already a game called " football " - the one those princeton and harvard boys enjoyed so much . to call the physical contact sport that they had just developed " football " would cause massive confusion .
imagine organizing a game of " football " only to have one team turn up in helmets and pads , not to mention the confusion future generations of " football moms " would have . so the americans adopted the word the english elite had fashioned to determine between the rugby derivative and association football .
soccer , perversely , became the game you played with your feet , while football remained the sport in which you used your hands . both terms are english names for the same sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a football or a soccer ball ?
when it comes down to it then , it 's all a matter of personal taste .
the english fans who champion the cause of football over soccer because " they play soccer in the us and football in england " are right but only in the literal sense .
both are the english terms for the same sport and those who argue that " soccer " is an american term and therefore an insult to the english game are misguided . for the americans , their brand of " football " is really nothing of the sort and if anything should be called " american rugby " . but really , when all is said and done - it 's just a game .

when it 's soccer .
but wait .
it 's the same game with the same rules .
so does it really matter what the sport is called ? someone once wrote that " a rose by any other name is still a rose . "
but what if that rose was a sport and that sport was football .
would football still be the same sport if it went by a different name ?
well , it does and when you look at it , it does n't make a lot of difference whether you call that sport " football " or " soccer . " except to a lot of people it does make a lot of difference .
which raises the question , why does it matter so much if a game , with the same set of rules and regulations applied regardless of moniker , is called one thing or the other ? the debate over whether " the beautiful game " should be called football or soccer seems to have been drawn up over national lines .
despite the fact that a version of the game was being played in china 3000 years ago , england is widely regarded as being the birthplace of the modern game we now call football … or soccer .
for the english , the game is most definitely called football . and this is where it starts to get interesting - and complicated . the game has been played in england since the middle ages .
it is unlikely that it had a name at that point as those involved were probably less concerned with what it was called and more worried about surviving the matches which often lasted longer than a day . early " fute-ball " nearly did n't make it to become " football " back then kicking , punching , biting and gouging were allowed and such was the ferocity of the game that king edward iii passed laws in 1331 to try and outlaw the game . in scotland , king james i , proclaimed in parliament in 1424 , " that na man play at the fute-ball " -lrb- no man shall play football -rrb- – which is one of the first recorded uses of the word associated with the sport . a good 400 years passed before the game gained enough credibility to be recognized as an official sport in england .
the football association -lrb- fa -rrb- was formed in london in october 1863 in an attempt to standardize the rules of the game which they called " association football . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blame for the term " soccer " sits firmly with the upper classes twenty-six years later , fed up with shouting out " hey lads , fancy a game of association football ? " public school and university students , most notably at oxford , began shortening the cumbersome title to " socca " and by 1895 the word had been reworked into " soccer . " " socca " phrase coined by english elite so far from being a totally unacceptable and derogatory word for football , the word soccer actually developed from some of the most privileged and highly educated minds in the country . back in the 1600s , the game of " fute-ball " was starting to cause mayhem in the colonies .
kick-abouts have been recorded at the original jamestown settlement in the united states as far back as 1609 . even before the forming of the fa in london , students at harvard and princeton were playing the game known as " football " in annual contests which began in 1827 , before forming their own small leagues in 1840 . invention of american football puts the us in a quandry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football played with the hands ?
not technically football .
when the americans developed rugby into their own brand of hand-held football in the late 1800s , they found themselves in a dilemma .
there was already a game called " football " - the one those princeton and harvard boys enjoyed so much . to call the physical contact sport that they had just developed " football " would cause massive confusion .
imagine organizing a game of " football " only to have one team turn up in helmets and pads , not to mention the confusion future generations of " football moms " would have . so the americans adopted the word the english elite had fashioned to determine between the rugby derivative and association football .
soccer , perversely , became the game you played with your feet , while football remained the sport in which you used your hands . both terms are english names for the same sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a football or a soccer ball ?
when it comes down to it then , it 's all a matter of personal taste .
the english fans who champion the cause of football over soccer because " they play soccer in the us and football in england " are right but only in the literal sense .
both are the english terms for the same sport and those who argue that " soccer " is an american term and therefore an insult to the english game are misguided . for the americans , their brand of " football " is really nothing of the sort and if anything should be called " american rugby " . but really , when all is said and done - it 's just a game .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .

the material weighs a total of 200 tons and is valued at 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- .
bad news about a recent helicopter crash would not affect the plan , a spokesman for the bundeswehr in berlin said .
on saturday , may 31 , a military helicopter loaded with injured passengers crashed without a trace , the official xinhua news agency reported .
" china-germany " is born also saturday , the first child was born in the mobile german red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
the baby was named zhong-de fang , which means " china-germany . "
to date , the hospital has treated more than 3,000 patients .
with more than 500 patients per day , the hospital is treating twice as many patients as it had planned .
meanwhile , on saturday , some 200,000 people were evacuated from the earthquake area , in sichuan province .
a million further inhabitants were told to prepare for evacuation in case a dam there broke .
china 's president hu jintao visited the shaanxi region , north of sichuan , on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : player interviews germany 's marcell jansen : " we 're unified with our fans " russia 's ivan saenko : " russia is n't looking too far ahead " soccer star mladen petric : " we are n't under any pressure " austria 's martin harnik : " austria wants to be a successful host " euro 2008 -pipe- 02.06.2008 greece 's angelos charisteas : " we are better than in 2004 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charisteas is a favorite with colleagues and fans alike after his euro 2004 heroics as part of an ongoing series of interviews ahead of euro 2008 , angelos charisteas , the greek forward of fc nuremberg , told dw that his countrymen are better prepared to win in 2008 than they were four years ago . greece achieved its greatest soccer success - winning the 2004 european championship title - thanks to goals by 28 year old angelos charisteas . in the quarter finals against france he scored the decisive goalin the 1-0 win , and then put the winner into the net against the hosts portugal in the final .
not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .
but we ’ ll have to see . interview : daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .

but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .
but we ’ ll have to see . interview : daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .

they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .
" we must make sure that biofuel production does not compete with crop cultivation , that it does not interfere with the need to produce food , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 02.06.2008 german minister under fire over telekom spying scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is self-regulation the answer when companies break laws ?
the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed . germany 's top managers have not been showing themselves in the best light of late .
recent months have seen one disreputable incident after another .
the head of germany 's postal service deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , stepped down after coming under investigation for tax evasion .
volkswagen was engulfed in a scandal after it was revealed that managers and supervisory board members had slept with prostitutes at the company 's expense .
discount supermarket lidl has admitted keeping their staff under video surveillance , while the german electronics giant siemens has acknowledged paying more than a million euros in bribes to secure foreign contracts . now deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications company , has admitted tracking communications between journalists and staff members .
an illicit attempt to end internal warfare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-experte karl zawadzky , deutsches programm , wirtschaft for years , leading executives at telekom have been at war with one another .
leaks to the press have been one weapon in their armory .
the former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke described the company as having as many " holes as swiss cheese ” .
of course , there are such things as company secrets and it is only natural that the executive board should attempt to protect confidentiality .
but if board directors and supervisory board members pass on information themselves in a bid to damage one another , then their company has a problem .
nonetheless , that does not justify breaking the law .
this is precisely what happened at deutsche telekom .
in order to find out where the leaks were coming from , a system was set up to spy on journalists and management and supervisory board members .
no one admits giving the scheme the go-ahead .
but telephone and internet data was clearly analyzed to find out who was communicating with whom .
this is a fact .
equally indisputable is that a spy was planted in a newspaper office . in addition , state prosecutors are investigating the possibility that people 's movements were tracked using cellphone data in order to find out who was meeting whom .
it is even suspected that online bank accounts came under scrutiny .
a loss in credibility for telekom ten telekom managers are currently under investigation , including former board chairman ricke and supervisory board chairman klaus zumwinkel .
all deny any wrongdoing .
whoever was responsible for the snooping scandal has dealt a massive blow to the company .
all telecommunications companies should be able to guarantee the confidentiality of telephone conversations and other private data .
no one wants to have anything to do with a telephone , cellphone or online services provider that does not respect confidentiality or the rule of law .
even though current ceo rene obermann called in the prosecutors and the accused have since left the company , the damage remains .
the german government 's calls for the telecommunications sector to agree to a data protection code of conduct will also not achieve much .
existing legislation is clear and quite sufficient .
if managers think that they are above the law and can do as they please , the only thing to do is to thoroughly investigate the matter , introduce transparency , and punish those involved . karl zawadzky -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders from 50 countries will gather in rome this week to discuss the issue .

they are suffering the most from the price hikes , said fao director-general , jacques diouf .
" the current dramatic world food situation reminds us of the fragility of the balance between global food supplies and the needs of the worlds inhabitants , and of the fact that earlier commitments to accelerate progress towards the eradication of hunger have not been met , " diouf said .
the fao lists 22 countries in danger due to chronic hunger and high import levels of both food and fuel .
countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected .
a search for solutions the fao is expected to propose several solutions including food subsidies , cash transfers , food distribution and nutritional programs .
these emergency measures would require $ 775 million dollars , according to a donor appeal issued by another rome-based un agency , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
the fao has also proposed vouchers and subsidies to provide farmers with seeds , fertilizer and animal feed .
such a program could " improve food availability , increase the income of small producers and may reduce price increases in local markets , " fao said in a statement .
fao said implementing the program would require $ 1.7 billion . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .

both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with our shows , listeners can meet the people who shape it as well as those affected by it . learning by ear shows how globalization lifts people out of poverty and how others sink even deeper because of it .
when globalization critics from all over the world met in nairobi for the 2007 world social forum , they came with a clear message : globalization is one of the major causes for underdevelopment and poverty in africa .
however , western governments and international financial institutions like the world bank and the international monetary fund insist that africa must open its markets and increase trade with the western world in order to grow economically .
different faces learning by ear does not join in the battle .
instead , the shows analyze the different faces of globalization in africa .
our reporters speak with people who have left their homes in search of a better life in africa ’ s cities and even in europe .
they introduce listeners to african entrepreneurs who benefit from a globalized economy and they take a look at how the backbone of africa ’ s economy , agriculture , is changing under the influence of globalization . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .

learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .
the shows explore the many mysteries that aren ’ t necessarily discussed in school .
for instance , our reporters uncover how plastic bags are made and why they can become an environmental hazard .
fundamentals and phenomena our shows look at people falling in love and animals in their natural habitat .
we look at natural phenomena like why potatoes soften when they are boiled while eggs get hard .

learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .
the shows explore the many mysteries that aren ’ t necessarily discussed in school .
for instance , our reporters uncover how plastic bags are made and why they can become an environmental hazard .
fundamentals and phenomena our shows look at people falling in love and animals in their natural habitat .
we look at natural phenomena like why potatoes soften when they are boiled while eggs get hard .
there is a whole world of knowledge that surrounds us .

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.06.2008 opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed . germany 's top managers have not been showing themselves in the best light of late .
recent months have seen one disreputable incident after another .
the head of germany 's postal service deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , stepped down after coming under investigation for tax evasion .
volkswagen was engulfed in a scandal after it was revealed that managers and supervisory board members had slept with prostitutes at the company 's expense .
discount supermarket lidl has admitted keeping their staff under video surveillance , while the german electronics giant siemens has acknowledged paying more than a million euros in bribes to secure foreign contracts . now deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications company , has admitted tracking communications between journalists and staff members .
an illicit attempt to end internal warfare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-experte karl zawadzky , deutsches programm , wirtschaft for years , leading executives at telekom have been at war with one another .
leaks to the press have been one weapon in their armory .
the former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke described the company as having as many " holes as swiss cheese ” .
of course , there are such things as company secrets and it is only natural that the executive board should attempt to protect confidentiality .
but if board directors and supervisory board members pass on information themselves in a bid to damage one another , then their company has a problem .
nonetheless , that does not justify breaking the law .
this is precisely what happened at deutsche telekom .
in order to find out where the leaks were coming from , a system was set up to spy on journalists and management and supervisory board members .
no one admits giving the scheme the go-ahead .
but telephone and internet data was clearly analyzed to find out who was communicating with whom .
this is a fact .
equally indisputable is that a spy was planted in a newspaper office . in addition , state prosecutors are investigating the possibility that people 's movements were tracked using cellphone data in order to find out who was meeting whom .
it is even suspected that online bank accounts came under scrutiny .
a loss in credibility for telekom ten telekom managers are currently under investigation , including former board chairman ricke and supervisory board chairman klaus zumwinkel .
all deny any wrongdoing .
whoever was responsible for the snooping scandal has dealt a massive blow to the company .
all telecommunications companies should be able to guarantee the confidentiality of telephone conversations and other private data .
no one wants to have anything to do with a telephone , cellphone or online services provider that does not respect confidentiality or the rule of law .
even though current ceo rene obermann called in the prosecutors and the accused have since left the company , the damage remains .
the german government 's calls for the telecommunications sector to agree to a data protection code of conduct will also not achieve much .
existing legislation is clear and quite sufficient .
if managers think that they are above the law and can do as they please , the only thing to do is to thoroughly investigate the matter , introduce transparency , and punish those involved . karl zawadzky -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .
but we ’ ll have to see . interview : daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

next to her braided hair a kalashnikov sat ready .
the journalist peter mantello risked his life to fotograph this child soldier in burma .
the military regime in the asian country does not look kindly on such photos being published and after the recent deadly cyclone restricted press efforts to report from the devestated zone .
mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "
for more than two days about 800 journalists , politicians , academics and cultural figures from around the world will discuss media issues .
the theme " peacebuilding and conflict prevention " could not have been more timely as two deutsche welle journalists were recently killed in afghanistan .
but the conference in bonn is about dialogue , not navel gazing .
" the role of journalism and the media must be discussed and defined .
that goes equally for peacebuilding and crisis prevention , governance and human rights , civil society and transmission of values , education and development , " said deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann .
no democracy without free press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european soldiers take part in peacekeeping missions what is europe doing about the crises in the world ?
this question is at the center of congressional debates .
for some time , crisis prevention has been one of the four basic components of the eu 's foreign policy .
the european union has undertaken plenty of peace missions .
it had soldiers take part in united nations peacekeeping missions to helmets safeguarded elections in congo .
eu police monitored the border between egypt and the gaza strip .
eu forces were involved in helping build security and legal institutions in the balkans , afghanistan and in former communist countries .
but there is still a lot which needs to be done , said georg boomgarden , state secretary for the german foreign office .
" journalism is holy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirin ebadi said journalism is a holy calling iranian nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi spoke during the conference 's opening day .
" when violence is detected , the human conscience is also awakened , " ebadi said .
" there you can find an answer .
journalistic work is both a dangerous and a holy job . "
deutsche welle broadcasts from central europe around the world via radio , television and internet .
even so , two-thirds of people live in countries where free press and media freedom remain foreign words .
deutsche welle journalists help to build free media outlets – such as after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan .
the deutsche welle global media forum will take place regularly in bonn .
the main agenda items will change , but the event will always address ways to cope with challenges which are largely influenced by the global media . stefan dege -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .
" we must make sure that biofuel production does not compete with crop cultivation , that it does not interfere with the need to produce food , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .
the shows explore the many mysteries that aren ’ t necessarily discussed in school .
for instance , our reporters uncover how plastic bags are made and why they can become an environmental hazard .
fundamentals and phenomena our shows look at people falling in love and animals in their natural habitat .
we look at natural phenomena like why potatoes soften when they are boiled while eggs get hard .
there is a whole world of knowledge that surrounds us .
with learning by ear , listeners have the chance to understand it . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .
learning by ear is supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office . listeners ' reactions read what other people think about the serie " general knowledge - daily miracles " on the next page . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .
the shows explore the many mysteries that aren ’ t necessarily discussed in school .
for instance , our reporters uncover how plastic bags are made and why they can become an environmental hazard .
fundamentals and phenomena our shows look at people falling in love and animals in their natural habitat .
we look at natural phenomena like why potatoes soften when they are boiled while eggs get hard .
there is a whole world of knowledge that surrounds us .
with learning by ear , listeners have the chance to understand it . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .
learning by ear is supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office . listeners ' reactions read what other people think about the serie " general knowledge - daily miracles " on the next page . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is really one of the problems seriously affecting the african continent – and são tomé and príncipe is no exception .
i hope that you will take up subjects like these in the next series of learning by ear to communicate these messages further , particularly in africa . "
-lrb- adilson castro , budo-budo , são tomé and príncipe -rrb- " i find the new series of learning by ear radio dramas very apt – because here in angola we ’ ve seen a great deal of environmental destruction , even though our nation is wealthy compared to other african countries .
i am convinced that learning is the key : with educated young people , the future is in safe hands . "
-lrb- figueiredo cassinda , huambo , angola -rrb- " before the presentation of the learning by ear episode , on how to process polythene waste and the bad effects on the environment , that improper disposal causes , i presumed that there is nothing which is not degradable , once buried in the soil .
sincerely , this programme is entertaining and really satisfying us .
we are hoping that our leaders would enact a law controlling all polythene producing industries .
the people should learn to use and dispose polythene materials in a proper way . "

when it 's soccer .
but wait .
it 's the same game with the same rules .
so does it really matter what the sport is called ? someone once wrote that " a rose by any other name is still a rose . "
but what if that rose was a sport and that sport was football .
would football still be the same sport if it went by a different name ?
well , it does and when you look at it , it does n't make a lot of difference whether you call that sport " football " or " soccer . " except to a lot of people it does make a lot of difference .
which raises the question , why does it matter so much if a game , with the same set of rules and regulations applied regardless of moniker , is called one thing or the other ? the debate over whether " the beautiful game " should be called football or soccer seems to have been drawn up over national lines .
despite the fact that a version of the game was being played in china 3000 years ago , england is widely regarded as being the birthplace of the modern game we now call football … or soccer .
for the english , the game is most definitely called football . and this is where it starts to get interesting - and complicated . the game has been played in england since the middle ages .
it is unlikely that it had a name at that point as those involved were probably less concerned with what it was called and more worried about surviving the matches which often lasted longer than a day . early " fute-ball " nearly did n't make it to become " football " back then kicking , punching , biting and gouging were allowed and such was the ferocity of the game that king edward iii passed laws in 1331 to try and outlaw the game . in scotland , king james i , proclaimed in parliament in 1424 , " that na man play at the fute-ball " -lrb- no man shall play football -rrb- – which is one of the first recorded uses of the word associated with the sport . a good 400 years passed before the game gained enough credibility to be recognized as an official sport in england .
the football association -lrb- fa -rrb- was formed in london in october 1863 in an attempt to standardize the rules of the game which they called " association football . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blame for the term " soccer " sits firmly with the upper classes twenty-six years later , fed up with shouting out " hey lads , fancy a game of association football ?

" " socca " phrase coined by english elite so far from being a totally unacceptable and derogatory word for football , the word soccer actually developed from some of the most privileged and highly educated minds in the country . back in the 1600s , the game of " fute-ball " was starting to cause mayhem in the colonies .
kick-abouts have been recorded at the original jamestown settlement in the united states as far back as 1609 . even before the forming of the fa in london , students at harvard and princeton were playing the game known as " football " in annual contests which began in 1827 , before forming their own small leagues in 1840 . invention of american football puts the us in a quandry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football played with the hands ?

when the americans developed rugby into their own brand of hand-held football in the late 1800s , they found themselves in a dilemma .
there was already a game called " football " - the one those princeton and harvard boys enjoyed so much . to call the physical contact sport that they had just developed " football " would cause massive confusion .
imagine organizing a game of " football " only to have one team turn up in helmets and pads , not to mention the confusion future generations of " football moms " would have . so the americans adopted the word the english elite had fashioned to determine between the rugby derivative and association football .
soccer , perversely , became the game you played with your feet , while football remained the sport in which you used your hands . both terms are english names for the same sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a football or a soccer ball ?
when it comes down to it then , it 's all a matter of personal taste .
the english fans who champion the cause of football over soccer because " they play soccer in the us and football in england " are right but only in the literal sense .
both are the english terms for the same sport and those who argue that " soccer " is an american term and therefore an insult to the english game are misguided . for the americans , their brand of " football " is really nothing of the sort and if anything should be called " american rugby " . but really , when all is said and done - it 's just a game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : press freedom around the world media used to incite genocide can also bring peace , forum told european journalists sound the alarm on press freedom global media forum : new media in asia media in china - between censorship and commerce media -pipe- 02.06.2008 media forum looks at journalists ' role in peacebuilding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism can be a dangerous profession what is the role of media in peacebuilding and conflict prevention ?
the first deutsche welle global media forum seeks to create an international dialogue on these issues during a conference this week in bonn , germany . the genocide in sudan , civil war in zimbabwe , human rights abuses in burma or tibet are examples of violence and repressions brought to our attention thanks to the efforts of a free media .
engaged and courageous journalists expose and denounce these types of injustice .
every day , around the world , they are forming the knowledge of our globe .
what exactly can and should media do ?
what dangers come with peacebuilding and conflict prevention ?
these and other questions were discussed at the first deutsche welle global media forum , which started monday , june 2 .
getting to the heart of the story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a free press reports on painful issues such as the use of child soldiers profound sadness and wild determination are mixed in the face of a possibly 12-year-old girl .
next to her braided hair a kalashnikov sat ready .
the journalist peter mantello risked his life to fotograph this child soldier in burma .
the military regime in the asian country does not look kindly on such photos being published and after the recent deadly cyclone restricted press efforts to report from the devestated zone .
mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "
for more than two days about 800 journalists , politicians , academics and cultural figures from around the world will discuss media issues .
the theme " peacebuilding and conflict prevention " could not have been more timely as two deutsche welle journalists were recently killed in afghanistan .
but the conference in bonn is about dialogue , not navel gazing .
" the role of journalism and the media must be discussed and defined .
that goes equally for peacebuilding and crisis prevention , governance and human rights , civil society and transmission of values , education and development , " said deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann .
no democracy without free press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european soldiers take part in peacekeeping missions what is europe doing about the crises in the world ?
this question is at the center of congressional debates .
for some time , crisis prevention has been one of the four basic components of the eu 's foreign policy .
the european union has undertaken plenty of peace missions .
it had soldiers take part in united nations peacekeeping missions to helmets safeguarded elections in congo .
eu police monitored the border between egypt and the gaza strip .
eu forces were involved in helping build security and legal institutions in the balkans , afghanistan and in former communist countries .
but there is still a lot which needs to be done , said georg boomgarden , state secretary for the german foreign office .
" journalism is holy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirin ebadi said journalism is a holy calling iranian nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi spoke during the conference 's opening day .
" when violence is detected , the human conscience is also awakened , " ebadi said .
" there you can find an answer .
journalistic work is both a dangerous and a holy job . "
deutsche welle broadcasts from central europe around the world via radio , television and internet .
even so , two-thirds of people live in countries where free press and media freedom remain foreign words .
deutsche welle journalists help to build free media outlets – such as after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan .
the deutsche welle global media forum will take place regularly in bonn .
the main agenda items will change , but the event will always address ways to cope with challenges which are largely influenced by the global media . stefan dege -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : player interviews germany 's marcell jansen : " we 're unified with our fans " russia 's ivan saenko : " russia is n't looking too far ahead " soccer star mladen petric : " we are n't under any pressure " austria 's martin harnik : " austria wants to be a successful host " euro 2008 -pipe- 02.06.2008 greece 's angelos charisteas : " we are better than in 2004 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charisteas is a favorite with colleagues and fans alike after his euro 2004 heroics as part of an ongoing series of interviews ahead of euro 2008 , angelos charisteas , the greek forward of fc nuremberg , told dw that his countrymen are better prepared to win in 2008 than they were four years ago . greece achieved its greatest soccer success - winning the 2004 european championship title - thanks to goals by 28 year old angelos charisteas . in the quarter finals against france he scored the decisive goalin the 1-0 win , and then put the winner into the net against the hosts portugal in the final .
not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .

that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : player interviews germany 's marcell jansen : " we 're unified with our fans " russia 's ivan saenko : " russia is n't looking too far ahead " soccer star mladen petric : " we are n't under any pressure " austria 's martin harnik : " austria wants to be a successful host " euro 2008 -pipe- 02.06.2008 greece 's angelos charisteas : " we are better than in 2004 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charisteas is a favorite with colleagues and fans alike after his euro 2004 heroics as part of an ongoing series of interviews ahead of euro 2008 , angelos charisteas , the greek forward of fc nuremberg , told dw that his countrymen are better prepared to win in 2008 than they were four years ago . greece achieved its greatest soccer success - winning the 2004 european championship title - thanks to goals by 28 year old angelos charisteas . in the quarter finals against france he scored the decisive goalin the 1-0 win , and then put the winner into the net against the hosts portugal in the final .
not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .

mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "

the first deutsche welle global media forum seeks to create an international dialogue on these issues during a conference this week in bonn , germany . the genocide in sudan , civil war in zimbabwe , human rights abuses in burma or tibet are examples of violence and repressions brought to our attention thanks to the efforts of a free media .
engaged and courageous journalists expose and denounce these types of injustice .
every day , around the world , they are forming the knowledge of our globe .
what exactly can and should media do ?
what dangers come with peacebuilding and conflict prevention ?
these and other questions were discussed at the first deutsche welle global media forum , which started monday , june 2 .
getting to the heart of the story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a free press reports on painful issues such as the use of child soldiers profound sadness and wild determination are mixed in the face of a possibly 12-year-old girl .
next to her braided hair a kalashnikov sat ready .
the journalist peter mantello risked his life to fotograph this child soldier in burma .
the military regime in the asian country does not look kindly on such photos being published and after the recent deadly cyclone restricted press efforts to report from the devestated zone .
mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "
for more than two days about 800 journalists , politicians , academics and cultural figures from around the world will discuss media issues .
the theme " peacebuilding and conflict prevention " could not have been more timely as two deutsche welle journalists were recently killed in afghanistan .
but the conference in bonn is about dialogue , not navel gazing .
" the role of journalism and the media must be discussed and defined .
that goes equally for peacebuilding and crisis prevention , governance and human rights , civil society and transmission of values , education and development , " said deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann .
no democracy without free press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european soldiers take part in peacekeeping missions what is europe doing about the crises in the world ?
this question is at the center of congressional debates .
for some time , crisis prevention has been one of the four basic components of the eu 's foreign policy .
the european union has undertaken plenty of peace missions .
it had soldiers take part in united nations peacekeeping missions to helmets safeguarded elections in congo .
eu police monitored the border between egypt and the gaza strip .
eu forces were involved in helping build security and legal institutions in the balkans , afghanistan and in former communist countries .
but there is still a lot which needs to be done , said georg boomgarden , state secretary for the german foreign office .
" journalism is holy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirin ebadi said journalism is a holy calling iranian nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi spoke during the conference 's opening day .
" when violence is detected , the human conscience is also awakened , " ebadi said .
" there you can find an answer .
journalistic work is both a dangerous and a holy job . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .

opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .
" we must make sure that biofuel production does not compete with crop cultivation , that it does not interfere with the need to produce food , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the material weighs a total of 200 tons and is valued at 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- .
bad news about a recent helicopter crash would not affect the plan , a spokesman for the bundeswehr in berlin said .
on saturday , may 31 , a military helicopter loaded with injured passengers crashed without a trace , the official xinhua news agency reported .
" china-germany " is born also saturday , the first child was born in the mobile german red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
the baby was named zhong-de fang , which means " china-germany . "
to date , the hospital has treated more than 3,000 patients .
with more than 500 patients per day , the hospital is treating twice as many patients as it had planned .
meanwhile , on saturday , some 200,000 people were evacuated from the earthquake area , in sichuan province .
a million further inhabitants were told to prepare for evacuation in case a dam there broke .
china 's president hu jintao visited the shaanxi region , north of sichuan , on saturday .

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .
the shows explore the many mysteries that aren ’ t necessarily discussed in school .
for instance , our reporters uncover how plastic bags are made and why they can become an environmental hazard .
fundamentals and phenomena our shows look at people falling in love and animals in their natural habitat .
we look at natural phenomena like why potatoes soften when they are boiled while eggs get hard .
there is a whole world of knowledge that surrounds us .
with learning by ear , listeners have the chance to understand it . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .

learning by ear reveals the mysteries of daily life to you .
the world around us is full of mysteries that we hardly ever think about .
few people know how a text message finds its way from one mobile to another and even fewer might know why car tires are always black . learning by ear takes its listeners on a journey through daily life .
the shows explore the many mysteries that aren ’ t necessarily discussed in school .
for instance , our reporters uncover how plastic bags are made and why they can become an environmental hazard .
fundamentals and phenomena our shows look at people falling in love and animals in their natural habitat .
we look at natural phenomena like why potatoes soften when they are boiled while eggs get hard .
there is a whole world of knowledge that surrounds us .
with learning by ear , listeners have the chance to understand it . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .
learning by ear is supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office . listeners ' reactions read what other people think about the serie " general knowledge - daily miracles " on the next page . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse .

the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up . wolfgang schaeuble has called a meeting for monday , june 1 , with the sector in a bid to win assurances that the firms will stick to the laws in the future .
but many have failed even to respond to the invitation and critics say the deutsche telekom scandal proves that self-regulation does not work .
one of germany 's main police unions , the federation of german criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- , said schauble 's response to the snooping scandal was " fatal " and " pure window dressing . "
" after the inconceivable events that took place at telekom it is not enough to pass around coffee and cookies , " said bdk head , klaus jansen , in an interview with the german newspaper osnabruecker neue zeitung .
calls for self-regulation sends wrong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties campaigners see schaeuble as more of a poacher than a gamekeeper " it signals to the industry that what has happened is n't so bad at all , when in fact strict guidelines are urgently needed , " added jansen .
he also called for a massive expansion of data protection controls over the telecommunications sector .
the police union head also accused germany 's data protection commissioner peter schaar of having a " relaxed " approach to the most serious data abuses .
" clearly , when it comes to data protection schaar is blind in one eye , " said jansen . last week , the telecommunications giant admitted hiring an outside firm to spy on staff and journalists in a bid to discover the source of leaks about the firm to the media .
it said the " ill-advised use of communications data " happened in 2005 and probably 2006 .
the telecoms giant insists that the berlin consultancy firm network deutschland had not listened to journalists ' conversations , but only logged details about who had phoned whom as well as the time and duration of the calls .
the german government 's response has also been criticized by telekom 's competitors .
juergen gruetzner , head of the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that monday 's meeting reflected the government 's discomfort , as the largest shareholder in telekom , over the affair .
the vatm head said the scandal had done massive damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole and called for a discussion about whether penalties should be increased .
at the moment the maximum fine is 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- . opposition sees their fears confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new laws remind some of the east german secret police , the stasi the opposition sees the scandal as lending weight to its objections to laws introduced by schaeuble in january .
under the legislation firms are obliged to keep a record of every e-mail sent , every phone call made - mobile or otherwise - and all internet usage as part of measures to prevent terrorism and fight crime .
they are not meant to record or listen to the phone calls or read the e-mails , but must keep a log for six months of who e-mailed or phoned whom , and which web sites were visited .
police can apply to consult the information .
left party politician petra pau described monday 's meeting with the telecom industry and the call for self-regulation as " the worst kind of cabaret . "
she said it was schaeuble himself who was responsible for having billions of items of personal data stored .
" that is an invitation to abuse . " the deputy head of the green party parliamentary group , hans-christian stroebele , also said schaeuble was not the right person to tackle a case of horrendous data abuse . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 02.06.2008 merkel calls for action on food , oil crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crude oil price shock has sparked growing anger and strikes across europe german chancellor merkel has called for steps to ensure more oil production and supply stability and said she will push at this year 's g8 summit for a common approach to combat rising global food prices . speaking after meeting with japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda in berlin on sunday , june 1 , chancellor angela merkel said she was worried by runaway oil prices , which have sparked growing anger and a wave of strikes at european ports and refineries , and called for greater transparency in the oil market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda with merkel in berlin " i will support anything that moves in the direction of more transparency in terms of the trade and supply of oil , " merkel said .
oil prices have shot to more than $ 130 -lrb- 83.70 euros -rrb- per barrel in recent months , raising pressure on european governments facing irate port workers in france , banner-wielding truckers in britain and disgruntled italian and spanish fisherman who grounded their fleets in protest last week .
opec , which pumps 40 percent of the world 's oil , is reluctant to bend to demands that it produce more to dampen the red-hot market .
fukuda 's trip is part of japan 's preparations to host the g8 summit of leading industrialized nations on july 7-9 at toyako , a lakeside resort on the northern island of hokkaido .
japan succeeded germany as president of the g8 at the start of the year .
a " sustainable " solution fukuda said the rapid rise in oil prices had to be taken seriously and that market signals had to be heeded .
" we can not ignore the market and just decide something , " fukuda said . " the problem is that the oil price is rising faster and this does not only have a negative impact on the economy , but on our people , " he said .
" we should take this rapid rise in the oil price very seriously .
what is important is that more oil should be produced and we should invest in this .
we need a stable supply . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european motorists have been reeling from heftly gas prices fukuda said there was a need for more investment in exploiting crude reserves and increased efforts to save energy .
merkel called for greater transparency in the oil sector , from crude recovery to trade in petroleum products , but she remained cool about a recent proposal by french president nicholas sarkozy to cap value-added tax on oil across the european union to help countries deal with the soaring oil price .
" i support the proposal that we act together , " she said .
" but it of course depends on the exact measures being mooted .
we should see whether we can agree on something that is addresses our goal and is also sustainable in the long term . "
no biofuels at the expense of food production spiraling global food prices were a major topic during talks between merkel and fukuda , as the japanese leader called for urgent measures to provide food security to poor nations amid surging prices that have sparked riots around the world .
" we need short , middle and long term solutions to the crisis , " he said .
fukuda said world leaders needed to work together to tackle soaring prices and shortages and vowed to put it at the top of the agenda of the group of eight summit in japan next month .
" food producing countries no longer have sufficient stocks and are therefore trying to export less .
this has become the case with more and more countries in recent months , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have hit the poor the hardest fukuda said in the longer term richer nations must help poorer ones , particularly in africa , to be in a position to produce more food and become self sufficient .
" we need to export seed and know-how to those countries -lsb- which -rsb- need it . "
both fukuda and merkel warned that the production of biofuels as an alternative energy source must not be allowed to interfere with crop cultivation and aggravate food shortages .

not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .
but we ’ ll have to see . interview : daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.06.2008 opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed . germany 's top managers have not been showing themselves in the best light of late .
recent months have seen one disreputable incident after another .
the head of germany 's postal service deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , stepped down after coming under investigation for tax evasion .
volkswagen was engulfed in a scandal after it was revealed that managers and supervisory board members had slept with prostitutes at the company 's expense .
discount supermarket lidl has admitted keeping their staff under video surveillance , while the german electronics giant siemens has acknowledged paying more than a million euros in bribes to secure foreign contracts . now deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications company , has admitted tracking communications between journalists and staff members .
an illicit attempt to end internal warfare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-experte karl zawadzky , deutsches programm , wirtschaft for years , leading executives at telekom have been at war with one another .
leaks to the press have been one weapon in their armory .
the former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke described the company as having as many " holes as swiss cheese ” .
of course , there are such things as company secrets and it is only natural that the executive board should attempt to protect confidentiality .
but if board directors and supervisory board members pass on information themselves in a bid to damage one another , then their company has a problem .
nonetheless , that does not justify breaking the law .
this is precisely what happened at deutsche telekom .
in order to find out where the leaks were coming from , a system was set up to spy on journalists and management and supervisory board members .
no one admits giving the scheme the go-ahead .
but telephone and internet data was clearly analyzed to find out who was communicating with whom .
this is a fact .
equally indisputable is that a spy was planted in a newspaper office . in addition , state prosecutors are investigating the possibility that people 's movements were tracked using cellphone data in order to find out who was meeting whom .
it is even suspected that online bank accounts came under scrutiny .
a loss in credibility for telekom ten telekom managers are currently under investigation , including former board chairman ricke and supervisory board chairman klaus zumwinkel .
all deny any wrongdoing .

but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed . germany 's top managers have not been showing themselves in the best light of late .
recent months have seen one disreputable incident after another .
the head of germany 's postal service deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , stepped down after coming under investigation for tax evasion .
volkswagen was engulfed in a scandal after it was revealed that managers and supervisory board members had slept with prostitutes at the company 's expense .
discount supermarket lidl has admitted keeping their staff under video surveillance , while the german electronics giant siemens has acknowledged paying more than a million euros in bribes to secure foreign contracts . now deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications company , has admitted tracking communications between journalists and staff members .
an illicit attempt to end internal warfare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-experte karl zawadzky , deutsches programm , wirtschaft for years , leading executives at telekom have been at war with one another .
leaks to the press have been one weapon in their armory .
the former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke described the company as having as many " holes as swiss cheese ” .
of course , there are such things as company secrets and it is only natural that the executive board should attempt to protect confidentiality .
but if board directors and supervisory board members pass on information themselves in a bid to damage one another , then their company has a problem .
nonetheless , that does not justify breaking the law .
this is precisely what happened at deutsche telekom .
in order to find out where the leaks were coming from , a system was set up to spy on journalists and management and supervisory board members .
no one admits giving the scheme the go-ahead .
but telephone and internet data was clearly analyzed to find out who was communicating with whom .
this is a fact .
equally indisputable is that a spy was planted in a newspaper office . in addition , state prosecutors are investigating the possibility that people 's movements were tracked using cellphone data in order to find out who was meeting whom .
it is even suspected that online bank accounts came under scrutiny .
a loss in credibility for telekom ten telekom managers are currently under investigation , including former board chairman ricke and supervisory board chairman klaus zumwinkel .
all deny any wrongdoing .
whoever was responsible for the snooping scandal has dealt a massive blow to the company .
all telecommunications companies should be able to guarantee the confidentiality of telephone conversations and other private data .
no one wants to have anything to do with a telephone , cellphone or online services provider that does not respect confidentiality or the rule of law .
even though current ceo rene obermann called in the prosecutors and the accused have since left the company , the damage remains .
the german government 's calls for the telecommunications sector to agree to a data protection code of conduct will also not achieve much .
existing legislation is clear and quite sufficient .
if managers think that they are above the law and can do as they please , the only thing to do is to thoroughly investigate the matter , introduce transparency , and punish those involved . karl zawadzky -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected .

since the beginning of 2008 , marine fuel has jumped 30 percent .
french fishermen began launching work stoppages and blockades three weeks ago .
since then , fishermen in italy , spain and portugal have also gone on strike .
there have been calls for governments to abolish the tax on diesel to bring down the prices and for more subsidies .
in northern spain , fishermen were in a dilemma .
they ca n't continue to make a profit with high oil prices , but they also ca n't afford to stay home at the beginning of tuna season .
tuna brings in 80 percent of the revenue , said patxi martinez , a local boat owner .
tension mounts around europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen are angry while some spanish fishermen decided to go back to work , portuguese fishermen blocked access to warehouses over the weekend .
the resulting clash with police in the town of matosinhos left two people injured .
portugal 's president anibal cavaco silva called on his countrymen to remain calm .
" i hope that dialogue will produce positive results in line with the country 's higher interests , " he said .
italians have threatened to expand their strike if negotiations this week with agriculture minister luca zaia fail .
france had entered a " waiting phase , " said hubert carre , head of the nationa fisheries committee , the cnpem .
" whatever protests there are next week , they are more likely to take place in brussels , " carre said .
fishermen in britain also planned a demonstration in front of the agriculture ministry in london on tuesday .
french truckers also striking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's fao will look for solutions and it 's not only fishermen who are expressing their outrage over high prices .
there have been protests at oil refineries in recent weeks .
and monday some 200 lorry owners rallied in the french city of strasbourg .
other protests were planned in the french riviera , lyon , dijon and marseille .
in marseille , truckers threatened to occupy the total oil refinery in la mede , which has been blockaded on and off for the past three weeks .
french farmers and taxi drivers also got into the act , staging slowdowns .
some spanish truckers have also said they would start striking as of june 6 .
calls for increased aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been food protests around the globe the rising fuel costs have been particularly damaging as they have come at the same time as increasing food costs .
food prices increased at about double the rate of inflation in the european union , with dairy products leading the way , the bloc 's statistics agency said on monday , june 2 .
and europe is much better off than developing nations , where rising costs have caused food riots in a dozen countries .
leaders from 50 countries will gather in rome this week to discuss the issue .
the summit , hosted by the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , will try to get wealthy countries to commit to urgent aid and will also look at long-term strategies to safeguard food production .
the presidents of french , egypt and brazil along with the prime minister of japan and top un officials have said they will attend the summit , which starts tuesday , june 3 and will last four days .
zimbabwean president robert mugabe and iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad have also drawn protests with their presence at the event .
food shortage acute in poor countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising prices are a major concern countries will pay $ 169 billion to import food this year , a 40 percent increase over 2007 , according to the fao .
the increased costs are particularly felt in poor countries .
the urban poor and rural non.food producers spend a large share of their incomes on food .
they are suffering the most from the price hikes , said fao director-general , jacques diouf .
" the current dramatic world food situation reminds us of the fragility of the balance between global food supplies and the needs of the worlds inhabitants , and of the fact that earlier commitments to accelerate progress towards the eradication of hunger have not been met , " diouf said .
the fao lists 22 countries in danger due to chronic hunger and high import levels of both food and fuel .
countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected .
a search for solutions the fao is expected to propose several solutions including food subsidies , cash transfers , food distribution and nutritional programs .
these emergency measures would require $ 775 million dollars , according to a donor appeal issued by another rome-based un agency , the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
the fao has also proposed vouchers and subsidies to provide farmers with seeds , fertilizer and animal feed .
such a program could " improve food availability , increase the income of small producers and may reduce price increases in local markets , " fao said in a statement .
fao said implementing the program would require $ 1.7 billion . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mantello 's photos are now on display in bonn , part of a photo exhibit " forced to be cruel . "

not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .
but we ’ ll have to see . interview : daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : player interviews germany 's marcell jansen : " we 're unified with our fans " russia 's ivan saenko : " russia is n't looking too far ahead " soccer star mladen petric : " we are n't under any pressure " austria 's martin harnik : " austria wants to be a successful host " euro 2008 -pipe- 02.06.2008 greece 's angelos charisteas : " we are better than in 2004 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charisteas is a favorite with colleagues and fans alike after his euro 2004 heroics as part of an ongoing series of interviews ahead of euro 2008 , angelos charisteas , the greek forward of fc nuremberg , told dw that his countrymen are better prepared to win in 2008 than they were four years ago . greece achieved its greatest soccer success - winning the 2004 european championship title - thanks to goals by 28 year old angelos charisteas . in the quarter finals against france he scored the decisive goalin the 1-0 win , and then put the winner into the net against the hosts portugal in the final .
not surprisingly , then , he has achieved cult soccer-hero status in his native country . in the bundesliga , he has played for werder bremen -lrb- 2002-2004 -rrb- and nuremberg , where he is signed until 2011 . angelos charisteas , greece is going to euro 2008 as the defending champion . are they this year ’ s favorite as well ? no , i don ’ t think we are the favorite for any title .
that would be , once again , the big teams : france , germany , portugal , spain and italy .
we are a good team – i think even better than 2004 .
but we ’ re no favorites . why do you think this year ’ s greek national team is better than that from four years ago ? we have a lot of new players , and the coach has more possibilities .
we didn ’ t have that in 2004 .
we had only 13 or 14 good players , but now we have 18 , and all 18 could be starters .
we just have a better team now . since greece won in 2004 , logic dictates that they would win this year again , if the team is even better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece celebrate after beating portugal 1-0 in 2004 yes , but that is just theoretical .
the key is that we are part of the tournament .
it is our second european championship in a row , and for greece it is very important .
we are number eight in the world rankings .
i think that ’ s great and i hope that we can perform well in austria .
i ’ m happy if we play well - that ’ s the most important thing form . so you don ’ t believe there will be any surprises this time ? i think anything is possible .
but i ’ m realistic .
we aren ’ t favored to win .
we are the current european champions , and on the other side are 15 very good teams in the tournament .
we have to perform as well as we did last time , then we have a good chance . greece celebrated its greatest success with the euro 2004 title .
but since then things have unfortunately gone downhill : you didn ’ t qualify for the 2006 world cup , and your qualification for euro 2008 was turbulent , but successful .
is greece on its way back up ? after the great success in 2004 we went into a rut .
i think that ’ s normal .
we weren ’ t at the world cup , but with 31 points in the euro 2008 qualification rounds , we showed we are in top form , and can really pull through . as you proved during 2-1 the friendly match that you won against portugal in march . of course , but portugal has good players , and a good team with big names .
we respect them and have won the respect of all of europe . so you ’ ve made it to the european championships twice in a row , but not into the world cup .
are the european championships more meaningful for greece than the world cup ? no .
the world cup is important to us .
perhaps more important than the european championships .
but on the other hand we performed well in 2004 and then in 2006 we weren ’ t so strong .
now we are stronger .
that ’ s all .
for me it is important to be there through to the end of the tournament .
but sometimes it just doesn ’ t work out . does germany play an important role in the development of greek soccer ? yes , i think so .
there are four of us in the bundesliga -lrb- sotirios kyrgiakos , ioannis amanatidis , theofanis gekas -rrb- and of course our coach comes from germany .
i think we are all happy to play in the bundesliga .
it is also very important for otto rehhagel , because he can communicate with us much better if we speak german .
that is really , really important . so within the team you are a person who plays a role of helping communicate between the coach and the other players ? basically that is the job of the assistant trainer .
but sometimes i translate into greek or into german .
i like to do it .
i understand my coach very well , which is important for me . is otto rehhagel still so well liked in greece ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel is a king in greece , according to charisteas yes , now more so than four years ago .
after seven years on the job , he has the most successes to celebrate with the greek national team .
besides , he just extended his contract for two more years .
in greece , the man is a king . let ’ s take a look at the opponents greece will face in its draw . sweden is a very strong team , with good tactics .
russia has a lot of talent - we saw it in the uefa cup with fc zenit - we ’ ll have to be careful .
spain is a known quantity for us .
they are a very good team with superstars .
all three are very strong opponents .
i think all 16 participants in the final round of the european championships are top quality .
but whatever opponent we face , we can beat them if we perform well . how far will greece get in euro 2008 ? first , i have to say clearly that we are not the favorites .
we have a strong team and a chance to get further .
i think we can make it through the group phase into the quarterfinals .
for me , that would be a great success .
after that , anything is possible . what do you expect of the german national team ? the germans are always a favorite .
now they have a new team with a few new players , and a new generation .
you can talk and talk about soccer , but in the end it comes down to what happens on the playing field . who is your personal favorite ? i think italy will be european champions .
but we ’ ll have to see . interview : daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

learning by ear informs you about many others .
staying healthy can be an enormous challenge in africa , where different health threats are looming everywhere . if your listeners want to lead a healthier life , they no longer have to consult books – tuning in to learning by ear can be a first step .
malaria is africa ’ s biggest killer .
the disease is spread by mosquitoes and takes the life of an african child every 30 seconds .
but there are also many other potential health risks : food can rot quickly in the heat and drinking water that isn ’ t boiled may cause a typhoid infection .
to add to the troubles , obesity isn ’ t just a problem in the industrialized world anymore – it ’ s on the rise in africa as well .
prevention is easier than a cure many diseases are easily preventable , but most people don ’ t know how .
sometimes , storing food properly and taking care of personal hygiene is all that it takes .
in a radio play , learning by ear accompanies five boys who have just started to live on their own .
listeners will join them as they begin identifying possible health threats in and around their house and simple ways to avoid them . learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .

that is really one of the problems seriously affecting the african continent – and são tomé and príncipe is no exception .
i hope that you will take up subjects like these in the next series of learning by ear to communicate these messages further , particularly in africa . "
-lrb- adilson castro , budo-budo , são tomé and príncipe -rrb- " i find the new series of learning by ear radio dramas very apt – because here in angola we ’ ve seen a great deal of environmental destruction , even though our nation is wealthy compared to other african countries .
i am convinced that learning is the key : with educated young people , the future is in safe hands . "
-lrb- figueiredo cassinda , huambo , angola -rrb- " before the presentation of the learning by ear episode , on how to process polythene waste and the bad effects on the environment , that improper disposal causes , i presumed that there is nothing which is not degradable , once buried in the soil .
sincerely , this programme is entertaining and really satisfying us .
we are hoping that our leaders would enact a law controlling all polythene producing industries .
the people should learn to use and dispose polythene materials in a proper way . "

some 79 % of 1,000 people asked said the uk as a whole had been unrealistic about the affordability of housing .
but 37 % said they would still stretch themselves financially for property .
housing expert steve wilcox said many forget " prices go down as well " .
the survey comes amid a housing market which has seen prices fall by 2.5 % in the past month .
this is the first sustained fall in 10 years .
at the same time , the supply of mortgages is drying up .
the collapse of the sub-prime market has seen a 40 % fall in lending over the last year .
' loss of memory ' some 59 % of those surveyed felt the credit crunch was making people more realistic about what they could afford .
despite this , the poll revealed that there was still a large group of people ignoring the economic downturn - the 37 % who said they would still stretch themselves for a home .
people are so focused on wanting the dream home that they assume that if the expert is giving them the mortgage that means they must be able to afford it suman antcliffe debt counsellor professor wilcox told panorama : " it 's almost like we 've had a collective loss of memory .
" a lot of people have invested in the market over the last 10 years because of the way they 've seen it going up , and sort of assumed it is going to keep on going up like that .
" prices go down as well . "
that changes are having an impact , however .
it is predicted 45,000 people will have their homes repossessed this year - a rise of 17 % in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 .
yet the panorama survey suggested 10 % of those questioned had not studied their mortgage documents carefully before signing them .
price crash fears debbie march , from hinckley in leicestershire , bought her home three years ago .
she said she wished she had paid more attention .
if we do n't do something soon it 's going to get to the stage where if the prices do crash we wo n't have enough to sell to pay the mortgage off homeowner debbie march her only route to a mortgage was through a sub-prime lender with higher interest rates .
but the payments now dominate her life and she is struggling to cope financially .
" you do n't get a lot of sleep sometimes , " she said .
" it 's a real worry .
if we do n't do something soon it 's going to get to the stage where if the prices do crash we wo n't have enough to sell to pay the mortgage off . "
suman antcliffe , a debt counsellor with the citizens advice bureau -lrb- cab -rrb- , said too many people saw only the property ladder and did not pay attention to the price .
she said : " i think people are so focused on wanting the dream home that they assume that if the expert is giving them the mortgage that means they must be able to afford it .
" and that 's the problem , we rely too much on banks and lenders . "
anxious lenders meanwhile , county court judge stephen gold , who decides whether people are evicted or not , said a tighter market meant lenders got nervous .
the real problem , he said , was a phenomenon he referred to as the " comfort zone " .
" that 's the difference between the market value of the mortgaged property and what it would take to pay off the mortgage , " he said .
" as property values decrease that comfort zone shrinks , and the more it shrinks the more anxious lenders become . "
the panorama survey suggested a split of opinion over falling house prices .
some 52 % of those questioned said they wanted prices to keep going down .
but the opinion of homeowners differed .
the majority - 81 % - said they want prices to keep rising , in order to keep earning them money .
however , when people were asked what they thought would happen in the coming year the general view was clearer .
some 15 % still thought house prices would rise .
but 78 % believed they would either stay the same , or the ongoing fall would continue .
icm research surveyed 1,011 adults across the uk by phone on 28-29 may .
panorama : property - high anxiety will be broadcast at 2030 on bbc1 , monday 2 june .

suman antcliffe , a debt counsellor with the citizens advice bureau -lrb- cab -rrb- , said too many people saw only the property ladder and did not pay attention to the price .
she said : " i think people are so focused on wanting the dream home that they assume that if the expert is giving them the mortgage that means they must be able to afford it .
" and that 's the problem , we rely too much on banks and lenders . "
anxious lenders meanwhile , county court judge stephen gold , who decides whether people are evicted or not , said a tighter market meant lenders got nervous .
the real problem , he said , was a phenomenon he referred to as the " comfort zone " .
" that 's the difference between the market value of the mortgaged property and what it would take to pay off the mortgage , " he said .
" as property values decrease that comfort zone shrinks , and the more it shrinks the more anxious lenders become . "
the panorama survey suggested a split of opinion over falling house prices .

it would be the first time official advice suggested an age and amount at which children can drink safely .
children 's secretary ed balls , who will unveil the plans later , has called for a " culture change about drinking " .
other parts of the plan - such as prosecuting parents who allow children to drink in public - emerged on sunday .
continental culture according to government figures , the number of 11- to 15-year-olds drinking regularly fell from more than a quarter in 2001 to about a fifth in 2006 .

other measures in the cross-whitehall alcohol action plan include widening existing police powers to disperse youngsters .
it could also become illegal for under-18s to be regularly found with alcohol .
other ideas are : anybody who appears to be under 21 will be challenged by bars and off-licences to prove they are an adult before being sold alcohol .

teenagers persistently possessing alcohol in public will be subjected to anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- and acceptable behaviour contracts .
court orders requiring their parents to step in would also be issued .
mr balls said " tougher enforcement powers are needed to tackle under-age binge drinking " , although he said " enforcement measures alone are not the solution " .
he said : " we need to fundamentally influence young people 's behaviour and attitudes towards alcohol .
" this will involve talking to young people themselves but , crucially , parents tell us they want better , clearer information as they bring up their children . "

it would be the first time official advice suggested an age and amount at which children can drink safely .
children 's secretary ed balls , who will unveil the plans later , has called for a " culture change about drinking " .
other parts of the plan - such as prosecuting parents who allow children to drink in public - emerged on sunday .
continental culture according to government figures , the number of 11- to 15-year-olds drinking regularly fell from more than a quarter in 2001 to about a fifth in 2006 .

other measures in the cross-whitehall alcohol action plan include widening existing police powers to disperse youngsters .
it could also become illegal for under-18s to be regularly found with alcohol .
other ideas are : anybody who appears to be under 21 will be challenged by bars and off-licences to prove they are an adult before being sold alcohol .

teenagers persistently possessing alcohol in public will be subjected to anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- and acceptable behaviour contracts .
court orders requiring their parents to step in would also be issued .
mr balls said " tougher enforcement powers are needed to tackle under-age binge drinking " , although he said " enforcement measures alone are not the solution " .
he said : " we need to fundamentally influence young people 's behaviour and attitudes towards alcohol .
" this will involve talking to young people themselves but , crucially , parents tell us they want better , clearer information as they bring up their children . "

it would be the first time official advice suggested an age and amount at which children can drink safely .
children 's secretary ed balls , who will unveil the plans later , has called for a " culture change about drinking " .
other parts of the plan - such as prosecuting parents who allow children to drink in public - emerged on sunday .
continental culture according to government figures , the number of 11- to 15-year-olds drinking regularly fell from more than a quarter in 2001 to about a fifth in 2006 .
however , a third said they drank to get drunk .
it 's heartbreaking to watch this happening to a boy that i love mother of son who drinks family blighted by son 's drinking and average consumption by young people who drink has nearly doubled from 5.3 units in 1990 to 11.4 units in 2006 .
the new parental guidelines are intended to encourage a more moderate continental culture , rather than a binge-drinking culture .
other measures in the cross-whitehall alcohol action plan include widening existing police powers to disperse youngsters .
it could also become illegal for under-18s to be regularly found with alcohol .
other ideas are : anybody who appears to be under 21 will be challenged by bars and off-licences to prove they are an adult before being sold alcohol .
vendors will be subjected to a " two-strikes " rule on selling alcohol to children .
teenagers persistently possessing alcohol in public will be subjected to anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- and acceptable behaviour contracts .
court orders requiring their parents to step in would also be issued .
mr balls said " tougher enforcement powers are needed to tackle under-age binge drinking " , although he said " enforcement measures alone are not the solution " .
he said : " we need to fundamentally influence young people 's behaviour and attitudes towards alcohol .
" this will involve talking to young people themselves but , crucially , parents tell us they want better , clearer information as they bring up their children . "
' not the best way ' but charities and opposition mps have already criticised the proposals .
some say ministers should have been tougher on the drinks industry and limited advertising of alcohol as well .
" the question is now how can we more precisely calibrate the laws in order to target offenders , " said shadow children , schools and families secretary michael gove .
" yes , let 's look at that -lrb- but -rrb- the real question is why are young people drinking alcohol ?
what is the cause of disaffection ? "
and liberal democrat leader nick clegg said the government 's plans were misguided .
" trying to get parents involved is a good thing but once again the government is trying to create great fanfare for a new offence when criminalising people is not always the best way to deal with it , ' he said .
deborah campbell of drug and alcohol treatment charity addaction warned the proposals could make things worse for young people , arguing that " criminalisation " meant youngsters " may just be driven to going to more dangerous areas " .

the six families moved onto the land at rossett at the start of last week 's bank holiday and began work without planning permission .
the group admitted timing their move to give them more chance to get work done before officials could intervene .
wrexham council said the camp was unauthorised , but not illegal .
the group bought the land last year , but did not do anything with it until the bank holiday weekend .
rossett councillor robert shepherd told bbc wales everything had happened very quickly . "
we 're not as bad as they think we are " lisa norsher " it seemed a very organised set-up altogether , " he said .
" it happened the friday before the bank holiday started and the first i heard about it was just after lunchtime .
" within a couple of hours , they 'd put a load of hardcore -lsb- stone -rsb- down and some caravans already on site .
" there was an extra day 's work , to get organised before people returned to work on the tuesday .
' amazed , upset ' " i think people were amazed , upset , concerned . "
lisa norsher , a mother-of-five on the site , said her family had tried to live in a house but it " did n't work with the kids " .
" they go outside to play after school and they get called names - gypsy , gyppo , stinker , " she said .
" then they are coming in to me , ' mam , what 's a gypsy ? ' and all this .
they 're broken-hearted then , and i have to sit them down and explain what it means .
" -lsb- we 're going to -rsb- stay in a caravan all the time and people -lsb- can -rsb- get to know us and how we live .
" we 're not as bad as they think we are . "
mrs norsher said other temporary camps had been successful in the past .
" they put us on to solicitors who work with travellers and we phone them up and they say , ' yes , you have got rights ' . "

the region is home to the three gorges dam , the largest hydro-electric power project in the world .
dubbed the biggest engineering feat since the great wall , it has taken shape over the last 16 years .
the dam has spawned a reservoir 660 km -lrb- 410 miles -rrb- long and about 1km wide , displaced millions of people and submerged many cultural heritage sites .
environmental groups say the project has wreaked havoc in the region , bringing pollution , soil erosion and landslides , as well as blocking fish migratory routes along the world 's third longest river .
but officials believe the benefits outweigh the costs .
when its 6,000-tonne turbines begin work - scheduled for next year - they will produce enough electricity to power a sizeable city .
china points out the dam will generate non-polluting power and stop the yangtze valley flooding , a problem that claimed the lives of an estimated nearly one million people during the 20th century .
scientists have claimed the weight of water from the dam reservoir will be so heavy it could even tilt the earth on its rotational axis by a slight degree , though this will be imperceptible to humans .

jada blamed the fall on having one fewer selling day in the month compared with last year and on april 's sales being boosted by tax changes .
sales by toyota fell 2.8 % while nissan sales were down by 11.4 % , but honda managed a 5.1 % rise .
overall there were 221,377 vehicles sold , excluding 660cc minivehicles .
the sales level for may is about half the peak level , achieved in 1990 , jada said .
as sales fall in japan , toyota is also considering downgrading its growth forecast in the us , according to the financial times .
toyota 's president katsuaki watanabe told the ft : " as of now we have n't changed our original annual plan yet , but we may have to scale back . "
the carmaker is worried that an expected drop in sales of big vehicles such as suvs and pick-up trucks will not be made up for by sales of smaller , more fuel-efficient vehicles such as its prius hybrid .

sarah jessica parker and jennifer hudson on sex and the city and yves saint laurent sarah jessica parker and her sex and the city co-stars have scored a number one at the us and canada box office .
the film , which reunites the cast of the hit tv series , took $ 55.7m -lrb- £ 28.3m -rrb- in its opening weekend , according to estimated figures .
movie studio warner brothers had expected it to make only $ 30m -lrb- £ 15.2m -rrb- .
indiana jones slipped to second place with takings of $ 46m -lrb- £ 23m -rrb- , while horror film the strangers debuted at three on $ 20.7m -lrb- £ 10.5m -rrb- .
sex and the city 's box office haul is the biggest in us cinema history for an r-rated comedy - beating the likes of american pie and there 's something about mary .
north american box office 1 sex and the city - $ 55.7m -lrb- £ 28.3m -rrb- 2 indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull - $ 46m -lrb- £ 23m -rrb- 3 the strangers - $ 20.7m -lrb- £ 10.5m -rrb- 4 iron man - $ 14m -lrb- £ 7.1m -rrb- 5 prince caspian - $ 13m -lrb- £ 6.6m -rrb- figures are for friday to monday .
source : media by numbers " this is a blockbuster for women , " said paul dergarabedian , president of media by numbers , which compiles the box office statistics .
" this was to women what indiana jones and star wars , let 's say , are to men . "
sex and the city creator darren star , who served as a producer on the movie , said it was too early to talk about a possible sequel .
but he noted that " women of all ages are following the journeys of these characters " .
the success of the film will come as a welcome relief to warner brothers , which recently suffered a high-profile flop with speed racer - which languished at number eight in this week 's chart .
elsewhere in the rundown , superhero film iron man dropped one place to number four , while narnia sequel prince caspian fell from two to five .
comedies accounted much of the rest of the top ten with cameron diaz 's what happens in vegas at six , followed by baby mama at seven , made of honor at nine and forgetting sarah marshall at ten .
