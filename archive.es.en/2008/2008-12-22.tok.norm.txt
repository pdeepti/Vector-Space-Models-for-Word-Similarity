yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .

government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.12.2008 germany 's oldest former chancellor helmut schmidt turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ninety years has n't slowed down helmut schmidt much more than a quarter of a century after being ousted as west german chancellor , helmut schmidt is very active for a man about to turn 90 .
he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .

government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
bailouts in the billions of euros have also been announced in britain and france .
the irish government has announced measures to get credit flowing to businesses and individuals .
it has also announced new rules aimed at making business lending more transparent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .
leterme has denied trying to meddle in the affairs of the judiciary , but has admitted that his office did contact judges prior to the ruling . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .

government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
bailouts in the billions of euros have also been announced in britain and france .
the irish government has announced measures to get credit flowing to businesses and individuals .
it has also announced new rules aimed at making business lending more transparent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .

on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .

appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .

steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .

" many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .

even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "
faced with rejection , the politicians may want to apply their market-oriented theories where they really belong , and look for a solution to overcrowded shopping malls instead . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission . "
the us already has some 31,000 troops in afghanistan , out of a total foreign force there of more than 65,000 from over 40 nations .
comparing taliban to nazis britain has the second biggest force at 8,700 , more than twice as many troops as next-in-line germany , france , canada and italy .
meanwhile , in an interview on saturday , dec .

he said western forces faced a long fight to defeat insurgents in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says britain will leave iraq long-term engagement hutton 's words hint at the government 's willingness to add more troops to its existing 8,000-strong contingent in afghanistan , where fighting against a resurgent taliban has cost the lives of 134 servicemen .
british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .
" that 's what we 've got to deal with .

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "
faced with rejection , the politicians may want to apply their market-oriented theories where they really belong , and look for a solution to overcrowded shopping malls instead . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.12.2008 german firms in russia feel the pennies pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies have invested in the russian market over the last few years the financial crisis has finally reached russia ’ s shores and the credit crunch has stark implications for businesses in the country .
german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .

today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .

russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .

even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 22.12.2008 ireland rescues troubled banks as the celtic tiger stumbles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks are the latest to need a bailout even as ireland announced a 5.5-billion-euro bailout -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- to save ireland 's three biggest banks , critics were questioning whether it would be enough to save the country 's troubled banks . throughout the 1990s , ireland 's booming economy , fueled by its real estate and financial sectors , was the envy of europe .
yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 22.12.2008 eu 's new toy safety rules are too weak , some say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu rules aim to protect children - but will it be enough ?
the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .

british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .

21 .
on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission . "
the us already has some 31,000 troops in afghanistan , out of a total foreign force there of more than 65,000 from over 40 nations .
comparing taliban to nazis britain has the second biggest force at 8,700 , more than twice as many troops as next-in-line germany , france , canada and italy .
meanwhile , in an interview on saturday , dec .
20 , with the times newspaper , british defense secretary john hutton compared fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan to fighting against the nazis .
he said western forces faced a long fight to defeat insurgents in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says britain will leave iraq long-term engagement hutton 's words hint at the government 's willingness to add more troops to its existing 8,000-strong contingent in afghanistan , where fighting against a resurgent taliban has cost the lives of 134 servicemen .
british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .
" that 's what we 've got to deal with .
that 's the nature of this counter-insurgency operation ...
it does n't lend itself to instantaneous results . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .

the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .

today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.12.2008 german firms in russia feel the pennies pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies have invested in the russian market over the last few years the financial crisis has finally reached russia ’ s shores and the credit crunch has stark implications for businesses in the country .
german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .

the attack has fueled calls to ban the far-right npd party . over the weekend , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for stepping up the fight against far-right statements and acts .
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the knife attack on alois mannichl , police chief in the southern german city of passau , was very troubling . " this is not about right-wing nuts or rampaging skinheads , " he said .
" here we have brutal criminals out for someone 's blood . " mannichl was attacked on dec .
13 with a knife outside his home by an alleged right-wing extremist and seriously wounded .
at the time of the attack , the assailant reportedly told mannichl : " greetings from the national resistance , " a term used by the neo-nazi scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois mannichl , left , and his wife talk to journalists upon leaving the hospital after the attack mannichl , who is known for his strong stand against the far-right , has pledged to press on with his work . horst seehofer , premier of bavaria and leader of the conservative csu party , told the bild am sonntag : " we must stand up to the right-wing octopus . " at public events like torchlight processions or concerts , we need to intervene more quickly , " he added . new ban proceedings ? seehofer announced an initiative by the upper house of parliament to explore a ban of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a far-right , anti-foreigner , racist group that is home to many with extreme views . steinmeier expressed his support for beginning proceedings to outlaw the party .
" the events in passau provide new reasons for a ban , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 300 people demonstrated against violence by the far-right in passau last week , chancellor angela merkel told a news conference that the government was seriously considering ways to ban the npd .
but she also warned that " any action against the extreme right must be guaranteed to work as the worst result would be a second failure " to ban the npd . the previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party , but the case was thrown out in 2003 by the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe which said that testimony against the party was possibly tainted by police informers who had infiltrated it . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has expressed skepticism at pursuing a ban . " we can not apply for a ban of the npd unless we are absolutely sure we can win one , " he told the bild am sonntag paper . " we would do our goal of defending our open society against its enemies a great service if we were to fail in karlsruhe again . " the npd holds no seats in the federal parliament , but is represented in two states in eastern germany .
the party had not been directly linked to the passau stabbing .
authorities have registered some 950 attacks by far-right extremists nationwide this year , including one killing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack has fueled calls to ban the far-right npd party . over the weekend , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for stepping up the fight against far-right statements and acts .
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the knife attack on alois mannichl , police chief in the southern german city of passau , was very troubling . " this is not about right-wing nuts or rampaging skinheads , " he said .
" here we have brutal criminals out for someone 's blood . " mannichl was attacked on dec .
13 with a knife outside his home by an alleged right-wing extremist and seriously wounded .
at the time of the attack , the assailant reportedly told mannichl : " greetings from the national resistance , " a term used by the neo-nazi scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois mannichl , left , and his wife talk to journalists upon leaving the hospital after the attack mannichl , who is known for his strong stand against the far-right , has pledged to press on with his work . horst seehofer , premier of bavaria and leader of the conservative csu party , told the bild am sonntag : " we must stand up to the right-wing octopus . " at public events like torchlight processions or concerts , we need to intervene more quickly , " he added . new ban proceedings ? seehofer announced an initiative by the upper house of parliament to explore a ban of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a far-right , anti-foreigner , racist group that is home to many with extreme views . steinmeier expressed his support for beginning proceedings to outlaw the party .
" the events in passau provide new reasons for a ban , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 300 people demonstrated against violence by the far-right in passau last week , chancellor angela merkel told a news conference that the government was seriously considering ways to ban the npd .
but she also warned that " any action against the extreme right must be guaranteed to work as the worst result would be a second failure " to ban the npd . the previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party , but the case was thrown out in 2003 by the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe which said that testimony against the party was possibly tainted by police informers who had infiltrated it . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has expressed skepticism at pursuing a ban . " we can not apply for a ban of the npd unless we are absolutely sure we can win one , " he told the bild am sonntag paper . " we would do our goal of defending our open society against its enemies a great service if we were to fail in karlsruhe again . " the npd holds no seats in the federal parliament , but is represented in two states in eastern germany .
the party had not been directly linked to the passau stabbing .
authorities have registered some 950 attacks by far-right extremists nationwide this year , including one killing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .
leterme has denied trying to meddle in the affairs of the judiciary , but has admitted that his office did contact judges prior to the ruling . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .

ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .

seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .

21 .
on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission . "
the us already has some 31,000 troops in afghanistan , out of a total foreign force there of more than 65,000 from over 40 nations .
comparing taliban to nazis britain has the second biggest force at 8,700 , more than twice as many troops as next-in-line germany , france , canada and italy .
meanwhile , in an interview on saturday , dec .
20 , with the times newspaper , british defense secretary john hutton compared fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan to fighting against the nazis .
he said western forces faced a long fight to defeat insurgents in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says britain will leave iraq long-term engagement hutton 's words hint at the government 's willingness to add more troops to its existing 8,000-strong contingent in afghanistan , where fighting against a resurgent taliban has cost the lives of 134 servicemen .
british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .
" that 's what we 've got to deal with .
that 's the nature of this counter-insurgency operation ...
it does n't lend itself to instantaneous results . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .
yet it could be enough if the guantanamo prisoner had previously lived in germany , polenz said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .

instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

the attack has fueled calls to ban the far-right npd party . over the weekend , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for stepping up the fight against far-right statements and acts .
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the knife attack on alois mannichl , police chief in the southern german city of passau , was very troubling . " this is not about right-wing nuts or rampaging skinheads , " he said .
" here we have brutal criminals out for someone 's blood . " mannichl was attacked on dec .
13 with a knife outside his home by an alleged right-wing extremist and seriously wounded .
at the time of the attack , the assailant reportedly told mannichl : " greetings from the national resistance , " a term used by the neo-nazi scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois mannichl , left , and his wife talk to journalists upon leaving the hospital after the attack mannichl , who is known for his strong stand against the far-right , has pledged to press on with his work . horst seehofer , premier of bavaria and leader of the conservative csu party , told the bild am sonntag : " we must stand up to the right-wing octopus . " at public events like torchlight processions or concerts , we need to intervene more quickly , " he added . new ban proceedings ? seehofer announced an initiative by the upper house of parliament to explore a ban of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a far-right , anti-foreigner , racist group that is home to many with extreme views . steinmeier expressed his support for beginning proceedings to outlaw the party .
" the events in passau provide new reasons for a ban , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 300 people demonstrated against violence by the far-right in passau last week , chancellor angela merkel told a news conference that the government was seriously considering ways to ban the npd .
but she also warned that " any action against the extreme right must be guaranteed to work as the worst result would be a second failure " to ban the npd . the previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party , but the case was thrown out in 2003 by the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe which said that testimony against the party was possibly tainted by police informers who had infiltrated it . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has expressed skepticism at pursuing a ban . " we can not apply for a ban of the npd unless we are absolutely sure we can win one , " he told the bild am sonntag paper . " we would do our goal of defending our open society against its enemies a great service if we were to fail in karlsruhe again . " the npd holds no seats in the federal parliament , but is represented in two states in eastern germany .
the party had not been directly linked to the passau stabbing .
authorities have registered some 950 attacks by far-right extremists nationwide this year , including one killing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
bailouts in the billions of euros have also been announced in britain and france .
the irish government has announced measures to get credit flowing to businesses and individuals .
it has also announced new rules aimed at making business lending more transparent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .
leterme has denied trying to meddle in the affairs of the judiciary , but has admitted that his office did contact judges prior to the ruling . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finland , which currently holds the rotating osce presidency , had sought to have the georgia mission revamped to empower it to cross internal conflict lines .
the mission has so far been barred from access to the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia , over which much of the august war was fought .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .
yet it could be enough if the guantanamo prisoner had previously lived in germany , polenz said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .

men who use cannabis risk becoming antisocial while women often become depressed and insecure . cannabis users between 17 and 30 years are at greater risk of developing multiple types of personality disorders than non-smokers in the same age group , a german study found .
cannabis also effects women differently than men , the study published in the german psychiatric journal fortschritte der neurologie psychiatrie found .
researchers at the protestant bethanien clinic in greifswald discovered that young men tended to become anti-social or develop borderline personality disorders while women who smoked cannabis often become depressed and insecure .
of the 99 cannabis users examined , 90 percent later developed an antisocial personality disorder .
personality disorders abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does marijuana do more harm than good ?
symptoms included disregard for social norms , reduced or non-existent empathy for other people and an inability to change behavior despite negative experiences .
one third of the participants in the study had three or more personality disorders .
however , the study could not determine whether using cannabis was responsible for any initial change in their personalities . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

men who use cannabis risk becoming antisocial while women often become depressed and insecure . cannabis users between 17 and 30 years are at greater risk of developing multiple types of personality disorders than non-smokers in the same age group , a german study found .
cannabis also effects women differently than men , the study published in the german psychiatric journal fortschritte der neurologie psychiatrie found .
researchers at the protestant bethanien clinic in greifswald discovered that young men tended to become anti-social or develop borderline personality disorders while women who smoked cannabis often become depressed and insecure .
of the 99 cannabis users examined , 90 percent later developed an antisocial personality disorder .
personality disorders abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does marijuana do more harm than good ?
symptoms included disregard for social norms , reduced or non-existent empathy for other people and an inability to change behavior despite negative experiences .
one third of the participants in the study had three or more personality disorders .
however , the study could not determine whether using cannabis was responsible for any initial change in their personalities . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "

on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .
yet it could be enough if the guantanamo prisoner had previously lived in germany , polenz said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says britain will leave iraq long-term engagement hutton 's words hint at the government 's willingness to add more troops to its existing 8,000-strong contingent in afghanistan , where fighting against a resurgent taliban has cost the lives of 134 servicemen .
british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.12.2008 germany 's oldest former chancellor helmut schmidt turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ninety years has n't slowed down helmut schmidt much more than a quarter of a century after being ousted as west german chancellor , helmut schmidt is very active for a man about to turn 90 .
he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.12.2008 germany 's oldest former chancellor helmut schmidt turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ninety years has n't slowed down helmut schmidt much more than a quarter of a century after being ousted as west german chancellor , helmut schmidt is very active for a man about to turn 90 .
he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .

instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "

" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.12.2008 german firms in russia feel the pennies pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies have invested in the russian market over the last few years the financial crisis has finally reached russia ’ s shores and the credit crunch has stark implications for businesses in the country .
german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "
faced with rejection , the politicians may want to apply their market-oriented theories where they really belong , and look for a solution to overcrowded shopping malls instead . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .

" many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "

finland , which currently holds the rotating osce presidency , had sought to have the georgia mission revamped to empower it to cross internal conflict lines .
the mission has so far been barred from access to the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia , over which much of the august war was fought .
" a consensus for a three-month technical extension was not possible today so it means we have to start withdrawing the mission , ceasing activities , on january 1 , " finnish official antti turunen , permanent ambassador to the vienna-based osce , told reporters monday , dec .
22 .
eight of the 28 observers will have to leave from january 1 , while the remaining 20 have until february .
the security agency also has a 152-strong mission in tbilisi which will have to be dissolved until a possible new mandate is decided , diplomats said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians were supported by russia in their attempt at independence integrity versus independence turunen said russia would have only agreed to an extension of the observer mission 's mandate if the organization recognized the independence of south ossetia and a second rebel region called abkhazia .
" we had one side defending the territorial integrity of georgia and the other the ' independence ' of south ossetia .
the sides are so far apart it made no sense trying to bridge the gap before dec .
31 , " he said .
only russia and nicaragua have recognized the two rebel regions as independent .
us ambassador julie finley said " only one country -lrb- was -rrb- responsible for this debacle .
it is the russian federation . "
georgian fury the georgian government reacted with anger at the cancelling of the osce mission , saying russia had refused to support an extended mandate to cover up " war crimes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian leader mikhail saakashvili has strongly opposed independence for the two regions " russia is trying to block the osce monitoring exercise in south ossetia because it committed war crimes there , including ethnic cleansing of the georgian population , " georgia 's minister for reintegration , temur iakobashvili , told news agency afp .
" the kremlin is desperately trying to bring legitimacy to its proxy regimes in south ossetia and abkhazia and international organizations are not allowing it to do so . "
russia unmoving on independence russian ambassador anvar azimov told reporters the negotiations had stalled because of the west 's refusal to accept " the new political reality that exists for us and that is the independence of south ossetia . "
" russia favours an independent presence of the osce in south ossetia ... even if we do not come to a deal , it is no tragedy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .
leterme has denied trying to meddle in the affairs of the judiciary , but has admitted that his office did contact judges prior to the ruling . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .

finland , which currently holds the rotating osce presidency , had sought to have the georgia mission revamped to empower it to cross internal conflict lines .
the mission has so far been barred from access to the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia , over which much of the august war was fought .
" a consensus for a three-month technical extension was not possible today so it means we have to start withdrawing the mission , ceasing activities , on january 1 , " finnish official antti turunen , permanent ambassador to the vienna-based osce , told reporters monday , dec .
22 .
eight of the 28 observers will have to leave from january 1 , while the remaining 20 have until february .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "
faced with rejection , the politicians may want to apply their market-oriented theories where they really belong , and look for a solution to overcrowded shopping malls instead . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finland , which currently holds the rotating osce presidency , had sought to have the georgia mission revamped to empower it to cross internal conflict lines .
the mission has so far been barred from access to the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia , over which much of the august war was fought .
" a consensus for a three-month technical extension was not possible today so it means we have to start withdrawing the mission , ceasing activities , on january 1 , " finnish official antti turunen , permanent ambassador to the vienna-based osce , told reporters monday , dec .

eight of the 28 observers will have to leave from january 1 , while the remaining 20 have until february .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians were supported by russia in their attempt at independence integrity versus independence turunen said russia would have only agreed to an extension of the observer mission 's mandate if the organization recognized the independence of south ossetia and a second rebel region called abkhazia .
" we had one side defending the territorial integrity of georgia and the other the ' independence ' of south ossetia .
the sides are so far apart it made no sense trying to bridge the gap before dec .

only russia and nicaragua have recognized the two rebel regions as independent .
us ambassador julie finley said " only one country -lrb- was -rrb- responsible for this debacle .
it is the russian federation . "

" the kremlin is desperately trying to bring legitimacy to its proxy regimes in south ossetia and abkhazia and international organizations are not allowing it to do so . "
russia unmoving on independence russian ambassador anvar azimov told reporters the negotiations had stalled because of the west 's refusal to accept " the new political reality that exists for us and that is the independence of south ossetia . "

finland , which currently holds the rotating osce presidency , had sought to have the georgia mission revamped to empower it to cross internal conflict lines .
the mission has so far been barred from access to the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia , over which much of the august war was fought .
" a consensus for a three-month technical extension was not possible today so it means we have to start withdrawing the mission , ceasing activities , on january 1 , " finnish official antti turunen , permanent ambassador to the vienna-based osce , told reporters monday , dec .
22 .
eight of the 28 observers will have to leave from january 1 , while the remaining 20 have until february .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians were supported by russia in their attempt at independence integrity versus independence turunen said russia would have only agreed to an extension of the observer mission 's mandate if the organization recognized the independence of south ossetia and a second rebel region called abkhazia .
" we had one side defending the territorial integrity of georgia and the other the ' independence ' of south ossetia .
the sides are so far apart it made no sense trying to bridge the gap before dec .

only russia and nicaragua have recognized the two rebel regions as independent .
us ambassador julie finley said " only one country -lrb- was -rrb- responsible for this debacle .
it is the russian federation . "

" the kremlin is desperately trying to bring legitimacy to its proxy regimes in south ossetia and abkhazia and international organizations are not allowing it to do so . "
russia unmoving on independence russian ambassador anvar azimov told reporters the negotiations had stalled because of the west 's refusal to accept " the new political reality that exists for us and that is the independence of south ossetia . "

men who use cannabis risk becoming antisocial while women often become depressed and insecure . cannabis users between 17 and 30 years are at greater risk of developing multiple types of personality disorders than non-smokers in the same age group , a german study found .
cannabis also effects women differently than men , the study published in the german psychiatric journal fortschritte der neurologie psychiatrie found .
researchers at the protestant bethanien clinic in greifswald discovered that young men tended to become anti-social or develop borderline personality disorders while women who smoked cannabis often become depressed and insecure .
of the 99 cannabis users examined , 90 percent later developed an antisocial personality disorder .
personality disorders abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does marijuana do more harm than good ?
symptoms included disregard for social norms , reduced or non-existent empathy for other people and an inability to change behavior despite negative experiences .
one third of the participants in the study had three or more personality disorders .

21 .
on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission . "
the us already has some 31,000 troops in afghanistan , out of a total foreign force there of more than 65,000 from over 40 nations .
comparing taliban to nazis britain has the second biggest force at 8,700 , more than twice as many troops as next-in-line germany , france , canada and italy .
meanwhile , in an interview on saturday , dec .
20 , with the times newspaper , british defense secretary john hutton compared fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan to fighting against the nazis .
he said western forces faced a long fight to defeat insurgents in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says britain will leave iraq long-term engagement hutton 's words hint at the government 's willingness to add more troops to its existing 8,000-strong contingent in afghanistan , where fighting against a resurgent taliban has cost the lives of 134 servicemen .
british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .
" that 's what we 've got to deal with .
that 's the nature of this counter-insurgency operation ...
it does n't lend itself to instantaneous results . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .

on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

the us already has some 31,000 troops in afghanistan , out of a total foreign force there of more than 65,000 from over 40 nations .

meanwhile , in an interview on saturday , dec .

he said western forces faced a long fight to defeat insurgents in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .

british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .

today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .

" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .

men who use cannabis risk becoming antisocial while women often become depressed and insecure . cannabis users between 17 and 30 years are at greater risk of developing multiple types of personality disorders than non-smokers in the same age group , a german study found .
cannabis also effects women differently than men , the study published in the german psychiatric journal fortschritte der neurologie psychiatrie found .
researchers at the protestant bethanien clinic in greifswald discovered that young men tended to become anti-social or develop borderline personality disorders while women who smoked cannabis often become depressed and insecure .
of the 99 cannabis users examined , 90 percent later developed an antisocial personality disorder .
personality disorders abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does marijuana do more harm than good ?
symptoms included disregard for social norms , reduced or non-existent empathy for other people and an inability to change behavior despite negative experiences .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .

british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
bailouts in the billions of euros have also been announced in britain and france .
the irish government has announced measures to get credit flowing to businesses and individuals .
it has also announced new rules aimed at making business lending more transparent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

21 .
on saturday , the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen said washington plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 extra troops to afghanistan by the beginning of next summer to combat a growing taliban insurgency in the east and south .
seeking a ' tipping point ' nato spokesman james appathurai told reuters news service that the additional us troops would go a long way to meeting the needs assessment of u.s. army general david mckiernan , commander of international forces in afghanistan .
but he said other allies still had to do more , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan wants to clear areas - and hold on to them mckiernan has said he wants the extra forces to reach a " tipping point " against the taliban and no longer wants to launch operations to clear an area unless he has forces to hold onto it and bring in aid and development .
appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission . "
the us already has some 31,000 troops in afghanistan , out of a total foreign force there of more than 65,000 from over 40 nations .
comparing taliban to nazis britain has the second biggest force at 8,700 , more than twice as many troops as next-in-line germany , france , canada and italy .
meanwhile , in an interview on saturday , dec .
20 , with the times newspaper , british defense secretary john hutton compared fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan to fighting against the nazis .
he said western forces faced a long fight to defeat insurgents in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops are mainly based in the dangerous south in the interview , hutton said troops in the violence-scarred country were defending british values in the same way they did in world war ii .
" we know that we must tackle the threat at source , it is not just going to go away , " he said .
" it is a struggle against fanatics that may not challenge our borders but challenges our way of life in the same way the nazis did . "
after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .
" we will stay there as long as is necessary to secure all of our objectives - it 's going to be years , " the minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says britain will leave iraq long-term engagement hutton 's words hint at the government 's willingness to add more troops to its existing 8,000-strong contingent in afghanistan , where fighting against a resurgent taliban has cost the lives of 134 servicemen .
british troops are mainly based in the southern province of helmand , which has seen some of the worst taliban attacks .
hutton said : " the key thing now is not that the taliban or al-qaeda can defeat us in afghanistan , their tactic is to outlast us .
" that 's what we 've got to deal with .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 22.12.2008 calls to get tougher on german right-wing extremists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are calling for authorities to crack down harder on the right-wing scene after a knife attack by a right-wing extremist on a german police chief , german politicians are calling to stepped up vigilance against the right-wing scene .
the attack has fueled calls to ban the far-right npd party . over the weekend , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for stepping up the fight against far-right statements and acts .
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the knife attack on alois mannichl , police chief in the southern german city of passau , was very troubling . " this is not about right-wing nuts or rampaging skinheads , " he said .
" here we have brutal criminals out for someone 's blood . " mannichl was attacked on dec .
13 with a knife outside his home by an alleged right-wing extremist and seriously wounded .
at the time of the attack , the assailant reportedly told mannichl : " greetings from the national resistance , " a term used by the neo-nazi scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois mannichl , left , and his wife talk to journalists upon leaving the hospital after the attack mannichl , who is known for his strong stand against the far-right , has pledged to press on with his work . horst seehofer , premier of bavaria and leader of the conservative csu party , told the bild am sonntag : " we must stand up to the right-wing octopus . " at public events like torchlight processions or concerts , we need to intervene more quickly , " he added . new ban proceedings ? seehofer announced an initiative by the upper house of parliament to explore a ban of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a far-right , anti-foreigner , racist group that is home to many with extreme views . steinmeier expressed his support for beginning proceedings to outlaw the party .
" the events in passau provide new reasons for a ban , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 300 people demonstrated against violence by the far-right in passau last week , chancellor angela merkel told a news conference that the government was seriously considering ways to ban the npd .
but she also warned that " any action against the extreme right must be guaranteed to work as the worst result would be a second failure " to ban the npd . the previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party , but the case was thrown out in 2003 by the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe which said that testimony against the party was possibly tainted by police informers who had infiltrated it . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has expressed skepticism at pursuing a ban . " we can not apply for a ban of the npd unless we are absolutely sure we can win one , " he told the bild am sonntag paper . " we would do our goal of defending our open society against its enemies a great service if we were to fail in karlsruhe again . " the npd holds no seats in the federal parliament , but is represented in two states in eastern germany .
the party had not been directly linked to the passau stabbing .
authorities have registered some 950 attacks by far-right extremists nationwide this year , including one killing . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.12.2008 german firms in russia feel the pennies pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german companies have invested in the russian market over the last few years the financial crisis has finally reached russia ’ s shores and the credit crunch has stark implications for businesses in the country .
german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .

russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.12.2008 germany 's oldest former chancellor helmut schmidt turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ninety years has n't slowed down helmut schmidt much more than a quarter of a century after being ousted as west german chancellor , helmut schmidt is very active for a man about to turn 90 .
he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .

the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .
21 .
government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .
europe 's banks on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : across europe , banks are in trouble ireland is not alone in bailing out its troubled banks .
in germany , the government package includes up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .
the german bailout package provides banks with up to 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in direct capital investment .
bailouts in the billions of euros have also been announced in britain and france .
the irish government has announced measures to get credit flowing to businesses and individuals .
it has also announced new rules aimed at making business lending more transparent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .

today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .
if we ca n't deliver to our customers , they may not buy from us in the future . "
russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .
still , the country has to make some changes to have investors believing in the country 's future , michael harms said .
" the required structural reforms have to take place in order to better the investment climate .
otherwise , russia will continue to lose more investors . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack has fueled calls to ban the far-right npd party . over the weekend , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for stepping up the fight against far-right statements and acts .
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the knife attack on alois mannichl , police chief in the southern german city of passau , was very troubling . " this is not about right-wing nuts or rampaging skinheads , " he said .
" here we have brutal criminals out for someone 's blood . " mannichl was attacked on dec .

" we can not apply for a ban of the npd unless we are absolutely sure we can win one , " he told the bild am sonntag paper . " we would do our goal of defending our open society against its enemies a great service if we were to fail in karlsruhe again . " the npd holds no seats in the federal parliament , but is represented in two states in eastern germany .
the party had not been directly linked to the passau stabbing .

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.12.2008 germany 's oldest former chancellor helmut schmidt turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ninety years has n't slowed down helmut schmidt much more than a quarter of a century after being ousted as west german chancellor , helmut schmidt is very active for a man about to turn 90 .
he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses there , too , have been hard hit . german businesses working in russia are starting to feel the pinch .
two thirds of the companies there are dealing with losses .
one of those companies , the darmstadt-based firm doehler , just opened their first juice concentrate factory outside of moscow in september .
already , chief executive oleg meisinger is feeling the pain .
" we ca n't even get the raw ingredients delivered to us right now in order to develop it further , " said meisinger .
" and the loans we give out to our customers are n't being paid back in time . "
the boom times roll to a stop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on projects like the one at " moscow city " are on hold not much remains of the russian market boom anymore .
many firms lack the capital for new investments .
in the past , german corporations could produce a growth rate of up to 60 percent .
in 2007 alone , germany 's exports to russia increased by 20 percent to about 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- .
now , though , russia 's banking system is one of the hardest hit by the banking crisis .
the world bank has slashed the country 's expected growth rate during the coming year , halving it to just three percent .
sinking oil prices have likewise contracted the amount of money the kremlin has to play with .
according to a study by the german-russian chamber of commerce , two-thirds of german corporations are reporting negative consequences of the financial crisis .
german firms operating within the country are having problems with their russian partners who are cancelling orders and paying invoices late . projects already in the works have also been put on ice .
hardest hit of all are those in the construction , banking and trade industries .
even the prestigious " moscow city " project , touted as europe 's largest building , is on hold until financing issues can be resolved .
" the companies have set their future plans , their personnel and their investment proposals on a very high level of growth , " said michael harms , the organization 's chairperson .
klaus mangold , president of the german business committee 's eastern division also warned recently in an interview with the newspaper die welt that german exports to russia could decrease .
cooperation and stamina : the keys to success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in russia are responding better to this crisis than 1998 's crash of the ruble while many in russia can still recall the consequences of the ruble 's crash in 1998 , russian companies are responding to this crisis differently .
today , they 're working together with their partners to find a solution to their payment difficulties .
harms agrees that this , along with a bit of stamina will help see these rocky times through .
" during hard times , even when cooperation and communication with customers is difficult , the search for a common solution should not be impeded , " he said .
" that 's one way that we can come through this crisis strengthened . "
still , companies are wary , as even strong firms can go bankrupt in times of crisis .
that threat has the food-handling firm doehler carefully verifying who their clients are .
" we 've got a dilemma on our hands and we have to know which of our customers are going to remain solvent , which will remain , " said meisinger .
" it 's also a risk for us .

russian attractiveness has yet to fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and natural gas reserves have made russia wealthy for now , though , growth still remains .
even doehler is expecting a 15 percent rate of growth .
that depends , of course , on their russian partners staying in the black , but meisinger sees the new factory in russia as one of the things that will help them through the crisis .
" we can use the financial advantages , like tariff exemptions or the use of local raw materials and pass those savings along to our customers . "
for them , and for others , russia remains an attractive market for german corporations despite all the difficulties .
at least that 's what the study by the german-russian chamber of commerce said .

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .

government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .
that is what i am determined to see happening . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin became a shopping mecca during the boom fine gael , ireland 's second largest political party , has criticized the government 's capital injection plan as being insufficient and called for an emergency meeting of parliament .
" the capital injections ... are unlikely to prove sufficient in restoring the confidence of domestic savers or international markets in the irish financial system unless further steps are taken , " fine gael finance spokesman richard bruton told the irish times newspaper .
loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .
on friday , anglo irish 's group chief executive david drumm stepped down , saying news of the concealed loan made it " appropriate " for him to quit .

but the country 's banks have been leery to take the government up on its offer , which is seen as having too many strings attached .

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .
it also aims to provide education and training on safety standards , with a particular focus on the " lower end of the market " where the vast majority of non-compliant toys are found .
moreover , it aims to ensure compliance among retailers and importers with eu and national legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the measures target low-end toys , especially the new law bans carcinogenic and toxic substance and restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances , and in a boon to children , parents and neighbors alike , new standards will also be set to prevent the sale of " deafening toys . "
other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangulation by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs .
the new rules " put the bar very high on the issue of consumer protection , " belgian conservative mep marianne thyssen , the parliamentary rapporteur for the bill , told afp news service .
toy industry before consumers ?
however , consumer-rights activists complained the measures did not go far enough .
the new text " reflects more the interests of the toy industry than those of children , " monique goyens , director-general of the european consumers association beuc , told afp .
while the beuc recognized that the new measures " will certainly bring some improvements to the safety of children in europe , " it said there has been a " sad lack of ambition from the eu institutions . "
many dangerous chemicals will still be allowed in the manufacture of toys , the association said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva knows consumers count on regulators it also complained that most toys will not have to be checked by an independent third-party before being placed on the market , " not even toys that have caused serious accidents in the past " including magnets which have led to stomach perforation and death .
advocate sees revision ahead " given the remaining risks , in particular due to dangerous chemical substances , such as allergens , carcinogenic and hormonal disrupting chemicals , another revision will soon be necessary and unavoidable , " goyens said .
the legislation was adopted by the parliament in strasbourg last thursday by an overwhelming majority of 481 for and 73 against , with the changes to the 20-year-old safety to enter into law very swiftly .
the move follows a string of scares and product recalls last year and will affect manufacturers in the eu and elsewhere , notably china , which is the world 's top toy exporter , selling 22 billion toys overseas in 2006 .

the attack has fueled calls to ban the far-right npd party . over the weekend , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for stepping up the fight against far-right statements and acts .
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the knife attack on alois mannichl , police chief in the southern german city of passau , was very troubling . " this is not about right-wing nuts or rampaging skinheads , " he said .
" here we have brutal criminals out for someone 's blood . " mannichl was attacked on dec .
13 with a knife outside his home by an alleged right-wing extremist and seriously wounded .
at the time of the attack , the assailant reportedly told mannichl : " greetings from the national resistance , " a term used by the neo-nazi scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois mannichl , left , and his wife talk to journalists upon leaving the hospital after the attack mannichl , who is known for his strong stand against the far-right , has pledged to press on with his work . horst seehofer , premier of bavaria and leader of the conservative csu party , told the bild am sonntag : " we must stand up to the right-wing octopus . " at public events like torchlight processions or concerts , we need to intervene more quickly , " he added . new ban proceedings ? seehofer announced an initiative by the upper house of parliament to explore a ban of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a far-right , anti-foreigner , racist group that is home to many with extreme views . steinmeier expressed his support for beginning proceedings to outlaw the party .
" the events in passau provide new reasons for a ban , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 300 people demonstrated against violence by the far-right in passau last week , chancellor angela merkel told a news conference that the government was seriously considering ways to ban the npd .
but she also warned that " any action against the extreme right must be guaranteed to work as the worst result would be a second failure " to ban the npd . the previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party , but the case was thrown out in 2003 by the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe which said that testimony against the party was possibly tainted by police informers who had infiltrated it . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has expressed skepticism at pursuing a ban . " we can not apply for a ban of the npd unless we are absolutely sure we can win one , " he told the bild am sonntag paper . " we would do our goal of defending our open society against its enemies a great service if we were to fail in karlsruhe again . " the npd holds no seats in the federal parliament , but is represented in two states in eastern germany .
the party had not been directly linked to the passau stabbing .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "
faced with rejection , the politicians may want to apply their market-oriented theories where they really belong , and look for a solution to overcrowded shopping malls instead . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the seemingly unstoppable celtic tiger is now swimming in debt , much of it tied to the bursting of the real estate bubble and years of excessive borrowing and spending . in an effort to reverse the country 's slide into a recession , the irish government has announced that it will inject 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.70 billion -rrb- into the country 's three biggest lenders and move to take majority ownership of one .
the irish government will take over the anglo irish bank , acquiring a 75 percent stake for 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.09 billion -rrb- .
it will pump an additional 2 billion euros into bank of ireland and allied irish banks , ireland 's finance minister brian lenihan announced on sunday , dec .

government stepping in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish are hoping for a little luck of their own these days irish banks have watched their share prices plunge 90 percent since the financial crisis began in august 2007 .
while the government will have a controlling stake in anglo irish bank , it will also acquire 25 percent of the other two banks , allowing it to vote on " key issues " lenihan told the irish times newspaper .
as recently as a week ago , allied irish bank -lrb- aib -rrb- thought it could weather the crisis .
the bank 's managing director donal forde testified before parliament that " we do n't feel we need capital . "
lax lending laws criticized the banks ' reckless lending practices are at least partly to blame for their current financial woes .
finance minister lenihan denied that he was rewarding reckless lending with a taxpayer-financed bailout .
" far from it , i mean heads have already started to roll , that 's very clear , " lenihan said .
" as far as reckless lending is concerned , this is a new beginning .
we have to have proper lending , responsible lending , lending for the real needs of the economy .

loan scandal added to mistrust yet the irish banking sector has been rocked by the disclosure last week that anglo irish 's chairman sean fitzpatrick had failed to disclose 87 million euros in loans over a period of eight years .
the loans , made to a building society , were done in such as way that they did not show up in bank reports .
fitzpatrick , who headed the bank for nearly two decades , resigned on thursday .
" this transfer of loans did not breach banking or legal regulations .
it was , however , inappropriate from a transparency point of view , " fitzpatrick said .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .
yet it could be enough if the guantanamo prisoner had previously lived in germany , polenz said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .

but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .

22 . belgium 's king albert ii accepted leterme 's resignation following a belgian supreme court report on allegations that his aides had sought to influence a court ruling connected with the break-up of belgian bank fortis .
the collapse of the government was the country 's third political crisis in under a year , and leaves five coalition parties to fight over who should pick up where leterme left off .
the political crisis leaves belgium facing a period of deep uncertainty at the worst possible time , with the economy sliding into recession and investors ' confidence at a low as a result of the global financial crisis .
media looks to dehaene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's experience could stabilize his country though he has been out of belgian politics for 10 years , dehaene , a flemish christian democrat , is seen by the belgian media as a likely prime ministerial replacement .
though his name and face were pictured on a number of belgian dailies monday , dehaene has declined to comment on reports he could be called upon to head an interim government until parliamentary elections could be held in june 2009 .
the 68-year-old led belgium from 1992 to 1999 .
" i think there 's a high chance that it will be dehaene , " said carl devos , political scientist at ghent university .
" he has the experience , he 's been prime minister , and would be an effective crisis manager . "
fragile unity political stability in this country of just over 10 million people has been marred by repeated disputes between representatives of the dutch-speaking flanders region and those from the french-speaking southern region of wallonia .
flemish leaders have called for greater powers for flanders , where roughly 60 percent of the country 's population resides , while walloons say such a move could lead to a partition of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though slightly smaller than wallonia , flanders has a much larger population flanders established itself as the dominant economic power of the two regions , with higher productivity , more investment and lower unemployment rates .
fortis dilemma the formation in march of leterme 's government , which included conservatives and liberals from both of belgium 's language groups as well as francophone socialists , resolved a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections .
but leterme was unable to conquer the hearts of belgians , and in particular those of the walloons , who viewed his plans for greater regional autonomy with deep suspicion .
the fall of leterme 's government centres on allegations that his office tried to influence a court ruling over the sale of fortis 's belgian operations , which was decided by the government but opposed by some 2,000 shareholders .
french bank bnp paribas has since said it would no longer proceed with its plan to buy a majority stake in fortis , one of europe 's most notable victims of the global credit crunch .
leterme has denied trying to meddle in the affairs of the judiciary , but has admitted that his office did contact judges prior to the ruling . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finland , which currently holds the rotating osce presidency , had sought to have the georgia mission revamped to empower it to cross internal conflict lines .
the mission has so far been barred from access to the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia , over which much of the august war was fought .
" a consensus for a three-month technical extension was not possible today so it means we have to start withdrawing the mission , ceasing activities , on january 1 , " finnish official antti turunen , permanent ambassador to the vienna-based osce , told reporters monday , dec .
22 .
eight of the 28 observers will have to leave from january 1 , while the remaining 20 have until february .
the security agency also has a 152-strong mission in tbilisi which will have to be dissolved until a possible new mandate is decided , diplomats said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians were supported by russia in their attempt at independence integrity versus independence turunen said russia would have only agreed to an extension of the observer mission 's mandate if the organization recognized the independence of south ossetia and a second rebel region called abkhazia .
" we had one side defending the territorial integrity of georgia and the other the ' independence ' of south ossetia .
the sides are so far apart it made no sense trying to bridge the gap before dec .
31 , " he said .
only russia and nicaragua have recognized the two rebel regions as independent .
us ambassador julie finley said " only one country -lrb- was -rrb- responsible for this debacle .
it is the russian federation . "
georgian fury the georgian government reacted with anger at the cancelling of the osce mission , saying russia had refused to support an extended mandate to cover up " war crimes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian leader mikhail saakashvili has strongly opposed independence for the two regions " russia is trying to block the osce monitoring exercise in south ossetia because it committed war crimes there , including ethnic cleansing of the georgian population , " georgia 's minister for reintegration , temur iakobashvili , told news agency afp .
" the kremlin is desperately trying to bring legitimacy to its proxy regimes in south ossetia and abkhazia and international organizations are not allowing it to do so . "
russia unmoving on independence russian ambassador anvar azimov told reporters the negotiations had stalled because of the west 's refusal to accept " the new political reality that exists for us and that is the independence of south ossetia . "
" russia favours an independent presence of the osce in south ossetia ... even if we do not come to a deal , it is no tragedy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has toughened rules on toy safety , but consumer advocates complain the regulations do n't go far enough . shortly before she signed an accord to improve toy safety last week , european union consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva noted that europeans count on the government to assure access to safe , reliable products .
" children are our most vulnerable consumers , and there can be no compromise when it comes to ensuring their well-being , " kuneva said .
" the agreement with toy importers and retailers is a very positive sign of the industry 's commitment to toy safety . "
focus on low-end toys the agreement , signed last week , bans the use of toxic substances and requires more visible warning signs .

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "
churches reject the proposal representatives of the protestant and catholic churches immediately rejected the proposal .
although churches will no doubt overflow again this year on christmas eve , " the suggestion of giving preference to members is not the right solution , " a spokesman from the protestant church of germany in hanover told epd news service .
the conference of catholic bishops told epd : " as a missionary church we are happy about each and every soul who will hear our christmas message .
there will be no entrance controls . "

waiting to get in or out of a church on the holy night is akin to waiting in line at a store that 's just put the nintendo wii on sale : people may not quite come to blows , but the whole affair does n't go down without some elbowing and nudging .
seats for paying customers amid all the cramping , personal-space-invading and crankiness , it can be easy to forget that the message behind the whole affair is supposed to be about loving thy neighbor .
one pair of german politicians appears to have completely lost sight of the true meaning of christmas , much to the shock of church officials .
representatives from the right-wing cdu and economic-liberal fdp parties suggested german churches - overflowing on december 24 but distressingly empty the rest of the year - reserve space on christmas eve for paying members only .
a quick explanation : in germany , church members pay a hefty percentage of their salaries directly to either the catholic or protestant churches .
the only way to avoid paying that tax is by officially quitting the church - something germans have been doing in droves for the past few years .
" members should n't be idiots " thomas volk , a cdu politician in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , told germany 's bild newspaper that reserving space for paying churchgoers seemed to be a fair way to avoid the crush associated with christmas eve masses , and would allow more space for older people .
anyone who does n't pay the taxes would simply have to accept missing out on christmas eve mass , he said .
martin lindner , a representative of the fdp in berlin , also spoke up on behalf of the paying membership .
" those who pay church taxes should n't be like idiots locked out of their own churches during important services , " he told bild . " congregation members should be allowed to reserve seats ahead of non-members . "

appathurai told reuters : " -lrb- nato -rrb- secretary general -lrb- jaap de hoop scheffer -rrb- would like to see an increase , not only from the americans , but also from other allies , in particular the europeans , to ensure we have a political , as well as a military , sharing of burdens within this mission .

after prime minister gordon brown confirmed on thursday that most british forces would pull out of iraq by the end of july next year , hutton said troops would be in afghanistan for the long haul .

men who use cannabis risk becoming antisocial while women often become depressed and insecure . cannabis users between 17 and 30 years are at greater risk of developing multiple types of personality disorders than non-smokers in the same age group , a german study found .
cannabis also effects women differently than men , the study published in the german psychiatric journal fortschritte der neurologie psychiatrie found .
researchers at the protestant bethanien clinic in greifswald discovered that young men tended to become anti-social or develop borderline personality disorders while women who smoked cannabis often become depressed and insecure .
of the 99 cannabis users examined , 90 percent later developed an antisocial personality disorder .
personality disorders abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does marijuana do more harm than good ?
symptoms included disregard for social norms , reduced or non-existent empathy for other people and an inability to change behavior despite negative experiences .
one third of the participants in the study had three or more personality disorders .
however , the study could not determine whether using cannabis was responsible for any initial change in their personalities . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempting to move past the bribery scandal , siemens turbines executive wolfgang dehen said monday at a baghdad signing ceremony that the iraq deal was big business for the tainted turbine maker .
" this is one of the biggest orders siemens has ever booked in the middle east , " he said .
the new power plants have a total capacity of 3,150 megawatts and are set to go on line by 2010 and 2011 .
siemens is also to supply high-voltage switchgear , transformers instrumentation and control systems for the power plants as part of the package .
the deal 's brokers are yet to specify whether the plants will be erected by the iraqi ministry of electricity or by general contractors .

the move has been welcomed by the united states as it works to close the controversial prison camp . thomas steg , german deputy government spokesman , said on monday , dec 22 germany strongly backed obama 's plans to shutter the detention facility and said berlin was assessing the possibility of accepting inmates who declined to return to their home countries .
" in our view guantanamo must be closed on legal and humanitarian grounds , in terms of international law and human rights , and for moral reasons , " steg told reporters in berlin .
steg emphasized that it is up to the us to find a place for inmates it did not want to accept and who could not be returned to their home countries .
" we would need to , and want to , examine this issue when the united states has made clear what its specific plans and timeline are , " steg said .
" if we begin to review such closure plans and take a stance , then it can only be in a european context based on a discussion with all member states , " he said , adding that germany would reject any " side deals , swaps or conditions " put forward by washington linked to handing over guantanamo prisoners .
us hails eu acceptance of prisoners the us said on monday it welcomed moves by european nations to take in prisoners from the controversial prison camp which has prompted worldwide criticism of what are considered aggressive detention practicies and which has opened the us to allegations of torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices an opening from germany and other european countries to take prisoners marked " positive steps forward " by governments that had been reluctant to help out in the past , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said . " many of these countries have previously been unwilling to work with us to either resettle or to , in some way , detain these individuals under circumstances where they wo n't pose a threat to others , " mccormack said .
hamburg willing to take in prisoners us president-elect barack obama made it clear last week that he wants to shutter the detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba , which holds 255 men arrested on suspicion of fighting for al-qaeda or the taliban .
yet many of the men have languished in the detention center of the us naval base for years without being charged .
about 50 are now thought to be innocent , but have not been released because they would face torture or death if sent back to their countries of origin .
yet many do not want to live in the united states .
rights groups have calls on eu countries to offer asylum to guantanamo detainees .
german chancellor angela merkel has long publicly advocated closing the camp for terror suspects , situated at a us navy base in cuba .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights groups have welcomed obama 's plans to shutter guantanamo in a surprise move , hamburg 's interior minister christoph ahlhaus signaled on monday that his state might be willing to take in guantanamo prisoners .
ahlhaus told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that prisoners who were shown to be innocent should be given the option of coming to germany .
germany not " dumping ground " germans have been particularly interested in the plight of the uighurs , a muslim minority in central asia .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
hamburg 's ahlhaus and fellow christian democrat guenter nooke , the government 's human rights envoy , are among the first high-ranking german politician to publicly call for germany to consider taking in some of guantanamo prisoners .
even so , both politicians have been careful to say that germany should not become a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners .
ruprecht polenz , chair of the foreign relations committee in the bundestag , pointed out that just because a country wants to " get rid of someone " does not mean that person would automatically qualify for german asylum .

he has a new book , cd and tv ads for die zeit , the newspaper he helps publish . this summer schmidt received one of germany 's top media prizes for his life 's work in politics and public life .
at the awards ceremony in leipzig , conservative chancellor angela merkel praised the social democrat as " one of germany 's most defining personalities . "
schmidt served as chancellor from 1974 when he replaced willy brandt , who resigned after his most senior aide was unmasked as a communist east german spy .
his eight-year tenure as head of government came during a turbulent period in west german history .
the country was having to cope with the effects of the 1973-74 oil crisis , dealing with the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles across its borders and fending off the domestic terrorism of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , a radical left-wing group .
to counter the soviet missile threat , schmidt pushed through a controversial dual-track proposal for nato .
the strategy envisaged talks on arms control coupled with the threat of basing cruise and pershing ii medium-range missiles in europe if the kremlin failed to agree to dismantle its ss20s targeted at the west .
the decision provoked massive anti-nuclear protests in germany .
schmidt 's own party failed to back him on the deployment , but his tough stance eventually paid off and moscow later withdrew its medium-range missiles .
he adopted a similar firm approach when dealing with the raf .
formerly known as the baader-meinhof gang , the group was responsible for more than 30 kidnappings and murders of prominent figures in the judiciary , politics and industry .
tough approach in tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt did n't bow to raf terrorists who hijacked a lufthansa place in 1977 schmidt refused to bow to their demands in 1977 when palestinian extremists hijacked a lufthansa airliner with 91 passengers on board in a bid to secure the release of raf leaders from a german prison .
instead , he ordered german commandos to storm the plane at the mogadishu airport in somalia .
the lufthansa hostages were freed unharmed but immediately afterwards three raf prisoners were found dead in their cells in what authorities said was a joint suicide .
in the autumn of 1982 , schmidt 's coalition with the liberal free democrats collapsed and he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence which saw christian democrat helmut kohl replace him as chancellor .
he quit politics a year later to concentrate on his work as co-publisher of the newspaper die zeit , where he continues to write critical articles and give interviews in the magazine today .
in november 2007 he noted that the us invasion of iraq under president george w. bush was " a war of necessity , not a war of choice . "
he also claimed that russia was being unfairly treated by the west , an issue he again took up in his memoirs , " outside of duty , " published shortly before his birthday .
since the collapse of the soviet union , " it was not russia that expanded its military sphere of influence , " schmidt wrote .
" rather , it is the west that has pushed nato up to russia 's borders . "
smoking controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt , pictured in this 1974 photo , was chancellor in turbulent times an avid smoker , schmidt was subject to a german police inquiry this year when an anti-smoking initiative claimed he was flouting the country 's laws on smoking in public places .
the inquiry was subsequently dropped after public prosecutors judged that schmidt 's actions did not pose a threat to public health .
" you certainly need a positive attitude towards passive smoking if you have anything to do with the schmidts , " joked television presenter reinhold beckmann after he visited the former chancellor and his wife , loki , at their modest terraced house in the hamburg suburb of langenhorn .
schmidt enjoyed inviting the world 's most powerful leaders to his home , among them french president valery giscard d 'estaing , with whom he helped lay the foundation for the launch of the single european currency , the euro .
" if people are together in a private atmosphere , it is much easier for them to open up to each other than if they meet in a conference room with lots of diplomats on either side of the table , " he said .
a talented musician , he has recorded piano concertos of both mozart and bach .
on his latest cd , chancellor and pianist , he is accompanied by pianist justus frantz and the conductor christoph eschenbach .
in a recent interview , schmidt complained of a growing problem with deafness that has affected his ability to appreciate music , particularly that of bach and mozart , who he said were great influences on him . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens is also to supply high-voltage switchgear , transformers instrumentation and control systems for the power plants as part of the package .
the deal 's brokers are yet to specify whether the plants will be erected by the iraqi ministry of electricity or by general contractors .
the iraqi ministry has been struggling to end constant power outages and restore damaged oil and gas-fired power stations .

he was savaged when interrogated last autumn by the treasury select committee for allegedly being insufficiently on top of the crisis at northern rock .

but the bank thought this problem was less serious than it turned out to be , he said in an interview for panorama .
the bank relies too much on interest rates to control the economy , he added .
sir john , who will be stepping down next year , also sits on the bank 's interest rate-setting committee .
in the interview with bbc business editor robert peston , he said interest rates were " a blunt instrument " , because they affected the whole economy .
there are some books ... which the taxpayer 's now holding , which clearly have a level of defaults in them sir john gieve ' no recovery soon ' in bank credit robert peston 's blog " we need to develop some new instruments , which sit somewhere between interest rates , which affect the whole economy ... and individual supervision and regulation of individual banks , " he said .
" we need to develop something which bridges that gap and directly addresses the financial cycle and prevents the financial cycle and the credit cycle getting out of hand . "
commercial future sir john has specific responsibility for financial stability .
he was savaged when interrogated last autumn by the treasury select committee for allegedly being insufficiently on top of the crisis at northern rock .
his colleagues regarded the attack as unfair .
have your say it seems to me that the bank of england does n't have much control over anything steve , blackburn send us your comments in his bbc interview , he cast doubt on whether the exchequer would get all of the money back that it has pumped into the banking sector .
" there are some books : northern rock , bradford & bingley , which the taxpayer 's now holding , which clearly have a level of defaults in them , -lsb- i 'm -rsb- not quite sure how that will balance out against the residual of the capital , " he said .
" as for the more mainstream banks , yes i think they 've got a commercial future and i 'm sure that in time they will ... revive and start building and growing as commercial entities again . "
meanwhile , the boss of barclays bank tells the programme that consumers and companies will continue to find it difficult to access credit for the next one to two years .

the project was due to last two weeks but was extended after 200 weapons were handed in at the start of december .
the haul included martial arts weapons and ceremonial swords .
chief supt josh jones said there was not a local knife culture but he was encouraged people were acting to stop weapons falling into the wrong hands .
special red bins were placed in the reception areas of 20 police stations across the force area .
all the 618 knives and weapons handed in will now be destroyed to take them out of circulation .
they include flick knives , butterfly knives , knuckle dusters and kitchen knives .
the initiative was funded by the home office as part of the tackling knives action programme -lrb- tkap -rrb- , which includes nine other forces across the uk .
chief supt jones said : " when we started the hand in a number of weeks ago , we did not really know what kind of reception it would get from the public .
i would hate for others to have to go through what we have had to endure over the past year mark davenport , parent of knife victim " clearly , the high profile coverage , for which we would like to thank the media , did have an impact on people because so many have used the opportunity to take personal responsibility for the dangerous objects they know of , by discarding them for good .
" i am in no doubt that many of these knives were unlikely to ever have been used for violence , but equally i am sure that a good number of them could well have ended up or been in the wrong hands . "
he added : " what is so encouraging for me is that people are not prepared to sit back and wait for the problem to develop before acting .
for that i commend everyone who has taken part . "
mark davenport , the father of a teenager who nearly lost his life when he was stabbed earlier on this year , helped launch the initiative in november .
his son kevin , 16 , was stabbed an inch to the left of his heart by a 15 year old boy as he rode his bike through cardiff city centre in july .
slight rise mr davenport said : " my son very nearly lost his life .
he was attacked by a group of boys and was stabbed in the chest by one of them he said : " the public have made a clear stand against knife crime in south wales , and i hope they continue to do so by which ever way they can .
" knife crime has such a profound effect on me , my son and the rest of my family .
the effects are long lasting and irreparable and i would hate for others to have to go through what we have had to endure over the past year . "
crime statistics show a slight rise in knife offences this year in the south wales force area , compared to 2007 , with the proportion of offenders under 17 also slightly increasing .
but police said it still accounted for only around 4 % of the most serious violent crime .

the project was due to last two weeks but was extended after 200 weapons were handed in at the start of december .
the haul included martial arts weapons and ceremonial swords .
chief supt josh jones said there was not a local knife culture but he was encouraged people were acting to stop weapons falling into the wrong hands .
special red bins were placed in the reception areas of 20 police stations across the force area .
all the 618 knives and weapons handed in will now be destroyed to take them out of circulation .
they include flick knives , butterfly knives , knuckle dusters and kitchen knives .
the initiative was funded by the home office as part of the tackling knives action programme -lrb- tkap -rrb- , which includes nine other forces across the uk .
chief supt jones said : " when we started the hand in a number of weeks ago , we did not really know what kind of reception it would get from the public .
i would hate for others to have to go through what we have had to endure over the past year mark davenport , parent of knife victim " clearly , the high profile coverage , for which we would like to thank the media , did have an impact on people because so many have used the opportunity to take personal responsibility for the dangerous objects they know of , by discarding them for good .
" i am in no doubt that many of these knives were unlikely to ever have been used for violence , but equally i am sure that a good number of them could well have ended up or been in the wrong hands . "
he added : " what is so encouraging for me is that people are not prepared to sit back and wait for the problem to develop before acting .
for that i commend everyone who has taken part . "
mark davenport , the father of a teenager who nearly lost his life when he was stabbed earlier on this year , helped launch the initiative in november .
his son kevin , 16 , was stabbed an inch to the left of his heart by a 15 year old boy as he rode his bike through cardiff city centre in july .
slight rise mr davenport said : " my son very nearly lost his life .
he was attacked by a group of boys and was stabbed in the chest by one of them he said : " the public have made a clear stand against knife crime in south wales , and i hope they continue to do so by which ever way they can .
" knife crime has such a profound effect on me , my son and the rest of my family .
the effects are long lasting and irreparable and i would hate for others to have to go through what we have had to endure over the past year . "
crime statistics show a slight rise in knife offences this year in the south wales force area , compared to 2007 , with the proportion of offenders under 17 also slightly increasing .
but police said it still accounted for only around 4 % of the most serious violent crime .

about 700,000 people in the uk have a form of dementia , a total that is expected to double or triple .
the department of health says it will ensure appropriate training is provided to health professionals and create more chances for them to specialise .
it will be interesting to find out how they are going to train people to spot the early signs of alzheimer 's disease because that is very difficult dr frank gunn-moore st andrews university a spokeswoman said : " we want to make sure that every gp is trained to spot the first signs of dementia , and to refer patients on to specialists .

terry pratchett : dementia campaigner he said : " as well as national training for gps , we 'd like to see memory clinics in every town , where people can go for treatment and support to help them live their life as normally as possible . "
memory clinics offer expert assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
these services could be provided by a range of professionals , from geriatricians and psychiatrists to local gps with a specialist interest , and could involve the voluntary sector , he added .
a 2007 report from the national audit office said 69 % of gps in england had access to local a memory service to which they could refer patients .
only 31 % of gps felt they had enough training to diagnose and manage the disease themselves .
family gp , dr rosemary leonard , said memory clinics are important for encouraging medical staff to liaise with social services because dementia is a social problem as well as a medical one .
she added : " one of the big problems in the early stages is that a lot of people with dementia cover it up ... and although some will come to the surgery , far more often it 's relatives who ring us up .
" i would encourage relatives if they are worried to contact their gp . "
post mortem dr frank gunn-moore , a senior lecturer in neurobiology at st andrews university who specialises in research for alzheimer 's diagnoses and treatment , welcomed the fact that the government was making dementia a higher priority .
however , he warned that differentiating dementia from normal ageing could be difficult .
often dementia was only diagnosed after other possibilities had been ruled out , and could only be definitively confirmed at a post mortem .
he said : " it will be interesting to find out how they are going to train people to spot the early signs of alzheimer 's disease because that is very difficult . "
according to the alzheimer 's research trust 163,000 new cases of dementia occur in england and wales each year - amounting to one every 3.2 minutes .
it says that unless treatments are found the number of people with cognitive impairment who will be placed in institutions will rise by more than 63 % from 224,000 in 1998 to 365,000 in 2031 .
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , said : " this is a much-needed move , as most dementia cases still go undiagnosed .
" unfortunately dementia research is still severely underfunded , receiving eight times less government research funding than cancer .
if we do n't act now on research , dementia will cost the uk economy £ 50 billion annually within 30 years . "
neil hunt , of the alzheimer 's society , said : " whilst today 's announcement contains good news , actions speak louder than words and there is an urgent need for investment in dementia to make these plans a reality . "

terry pratchett : dementia campaigner he said : " as well as national training for gps , we 'd like to see memory clinics in every town , where people can go for treatment and support to help them live their life as normally as possible . "
memory clinics offer expert assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
these services could be provided by a range of professionals , from geriatricians and psychiatrists to local gps with a specialist interest , and could involve the voluntary sector , he added .
a 2007 report from the national audit office said 69 % of gps in england had access to local a memory service to which they could refer patients .
only 31 % of gps felt they had enough training to diagnose and manage the disease themselves .
family gp , dr rosemary leonard , said memory clinics are important for encouraging medical staff to liaise with social services because dementia is a social problem as well as a medical one .
she added : " one of the big problems in the early stages is that a lot of people with dementia cover it up ... and although some will come to the surgery , far more often it 's relatives who ring us up .
" i would encourage relatives if they are worried to contact their gp . "
post mortem dr frank gunn-moore , a senior lecturer in neurobiology at st andrews university who specialises in research for alzheimer 's diagnoses and treatment , welcomed the fact that the government was making dementia a higher priority .
however , he warned that differentiating dementia from normal ageing could be difficult .
often dementia was only diagnosed after other possibilities had been ruled out , and could only be definitively confirmed at a post mortem .
he said : " it will be interesting to find out how they are going to train people to spot the early signs of alzheimer 's disease because that is very difficult . "
according to the alzheimer 's research trust 163,000 new cases of dementia occur in england and wales each year - amounting to one every 3.2 minutes .
it says that unless treatments are found the number of people with cognitive impairment who will be placed in institutions will rise by more than 63 % from 224,000 in 1998 to 365,000 in 2031 .
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , said : " this is a much-needed move , as most dementia cases still go undiagnosed .
" unfortunately dementia research is still severely underfunded , receiving eight times less government research funding than cancer .
if we do n't act now on research , dementia will cost the uk economy £ 50 billion annually within 30 years . "
neil hunt , of the alzheimer 's society , said : " whilst today 's announcement contains good news , actions speak louder than words and there is an urgent need for investment in dementia to make these plans a reality . "

she added : " one of the big problems in the early stages is that a lot of people with dementia cover it up ... and although some will come to the surgery , far more often it 's relatives who ring us up .
" i would encourage relatives if they are worried to contact their gp . "
post mortem dr frank gunn-moore , a senior lecturer in neurobiology at st andrews university who specialises in research for alzheimer 's diagnoses and treatment , welcomed the fact that the government was making dementia a higher priority .
however , he warned that differentiating dementia from normal ageing could be difficult .
often dementia was only diagnosed after other possibilities had been ruled out , and could only be definitively confirmed at a post mortem .
he said : " it will be interesting to find out how they are going to train people to spot the early signs of alzheimer 's disease because that is very difficult . "
according to the alzheimer 's research trust 163,000 new cases of dementia occur in england and wales each year - amounting to one every 3.2 minutes .
it says that unless treatments are found the number of people with cognitive impairment who will be placed in institutions will rise by more than 63 % from 224,000 in 1998 to 365,000 in 2031 .
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , said : " this is a much-needed move , as most dementia cases still go undiagnosed .
" unfortunately dementia research is still severely underfunded , receiving eight times less government research funding than cancer .
if we do n't act now on research , dementia will cost the uk economy £ 50 billion annually within 30 years . "
neil hunt , of the alzheimer 's society , said : " whilst today 's announcement contains good news , actions speak louder than words and there is an urgent need for investment in dementia to make these plans a reality . "

in 2008 the sex worker has been portrayed as the exploited victim of trafficking and as the high class escort belle de jour , played by billie piper in itv1 's secret diary of a call girl .
but london 's massage parlours , saunas , brothels and streets are the work places of a much wider range of women and men .
they include middle-aged parlour owners , men who sell sex to men and girls who work on the street with drug addiction problems .
and , like all workers , they face extra financial pressure at christmas , says catherine stephens , spokeswoman for the international union of sex workers -lrb- iusw -rrb- .
" january is usually quiet so many sex workers will work more during november and december to get extra money for their kids ' presents , " she explained .
very few women work on the street on christmas day as clients are unlikely to be there , miss stephens said .
" but massage parlours have been known to get incredibly busy on christmas eve and boxing day .
" i guess some men feel they have been cooped up with their family for 36 hours and want to get out . "
it is not illegal to sell or pay for sex in england but many activities associated with prostitution - such as running a brothel , persistent kerb-crawling and advertising in phone boxes - are illegal .
kitty , 24 , works as a dominatrix in finsbury park , north london .
she became a sex worker in her native california when she was 18 .
" it was the only thing i ever really enjoyed - i just stuck with it , " she says .
kitty 's clients must book her in advance , and she chooses to see no more than five men per week .
" i can afford to work less with people i feel are interesting , " she says .
" i 'm definitely no belle de jour but i make enough money to live comfortably . "
kitty will celebrate christmas with friends on 23 december , enabling her to see clients on christmas day if necessary . "
at christmas i 'm more likely to have clients change their minds and cancel bookings because they are too busy " kitty , dominatrix regular clients sometimes buy her christmas gifts of flowers or chocolates , but kitty says the season also brings unique problems .
" at christmas i 'm more likely to have clients change their minds and cancel bookings because they are too busy , they are stressed and not stopping , " she says .
" it 's very frustrating . "
kitty says men are also more likely to " go to extremes " at christmas by taking drugs or drinking heavily at parties .
she refuses to see them in such a state .
" but new year 's eve can be a busy time as men often want to hire someone to be an escort or companion for parties , " she adds .
" i 'm usually happy to do that . "
gay escort luca d , 29 , also assesses his clients before going to meet them across london or inviting them back to his flat .
" i talk to them online first so i can usually tell if they seem drunk or high , " he says .
" i wo n't take it any further if they are - i 've had a couple of guys being disrespectful to me in the past , so i had to throw them out .
" but most of my clients are very friendly and respectful . "
luca has been working in the city for three years after two years as an escort in his native france .
he sees up to five clients per day , but says demand is erratic and unpredictable .
" sometimes it 's really busy , sometimes you have no clients all week - that 's what i do n't like about it , " he says .
" it is often quiet just before christmas and new year 's eve , then busy again straight afterwards . "
when asked how much he makes as an escort , luca says : " enough . "
" i 'm not someone who is into expensive clothes , big flat screen tvs or whatever people get credit cards for , " he adds .
" and i can afford to take time off . "
women murdered on 17 december dozens of sex workers sang carols in the pubs and streets of soho , central london , to mark the annual international day to end violence against sex workers .
it marked the second anniversary of the deaths of five prostitutes in suffolk , whose bodies were dumped around ipswich .
steve wright , from ipswich , is serving a life sentence for their murder .
the iusw 's catherine stephens criticised government plans to outlaw all kerb-crawling and to make it illegal to buy sex from anyone who is " controlled for gain " .
" it will drive sex work further underground , exposing sex workers to greater risk of exploitation and violence , " she said .
" the government should completely decriminalise prostitution so they can then distinguish between good and bad practice in sex work .
" that is the only way to prevent trafficking and protect sex workers . "

in 2008 the sex worker has been portrayed as the exploited victim of trafficking and as the high class escort belle de jour , played by billie piper in itv1 's secret diary of a call girl .
but london 's massage parlours , saunas , brothels and streets are the work places of a much wider range of women and men .
they include middle-aged parlour owners , men who sell sex to men and girls who work on the street with drug addiction problems .
and , like all workers , they face extra financial pressure at christmas , says catherine stephens , spokeswoman for the international union of sex workers -lrb- iusw -rrb- .
" january is usually quiet so many sex workers will work more during november and december to get extra money for their kids ' presents , " she explained .
very few women work on the street on christmas day as clients are unlikely to be there , miss stephens said .
" but massage parlours have been known to get incredibly busy on christmas eve and boxing day .
" i guess some men feel they have been cooped up with their family for 36 hours and want to get out . "
billie piper plays belle de jour in itv1 series secret diary of a call girl it is not illegal to sell or pay for sex in england but many activities associated with prostitution - such as running a brothel , persistent kerb-crawling and advertising in phone boxes - are illegal .
kitty , 24 , works as a dominatrix in finsbury park , north london .
she became a sex worker in her native california when she was 18 .
" it was the only thing i ever really enjoyed - i just stuck with it , " she says .
kitty 's clients must book her in advance , and she chooses to see no more than five men per week .
" i can afford to work less with people i feel are interesting , " she says .
" i 'm definitely no belle de jour but i make enough money to live comfortably . "
kitty will celebrate christmas with friends on 23 december , enabling her to see clients on christmas day if necessary .
at christmas i 'm more likely to have clients change their minds and cancel bookings because they are too busy kitty , dominatrix regular clients sometimes buy her christmas gifts of flowers or chocolates , but kitty says the season also brings unique problems .
" at christmas i 'm more likely to have clients change their minds and cancel bookings because they are too busy , they are stressed and not stopping , " she says .
" it 's very frustrating . "
kitty says men are also more likely to " go to extremes " at christmas by taking drugs or drinking heavily at parties .
she refuses to see them in such a state .
" but new year 's eve can be a busy time as men often want to hire someone to be an escort or companion for parties , " she adds .
" i 'm usually happy to do that . "
gay escort luca d , 29 , also assesses his clients before going to meet them across london or inviting them back to his flat .
" i talk to them online first so i can usually tell if they seem drunk or high , " he says .
it is illegal to place cards advertising prostitution in phone boxes " i wo n't take it any further if they are - i 've had a couple of guys being disrespectful to me in the past , so i had to throw them out .
" but most of my clients are very friendly and respectful . "
luca has been working in the city for three years after two years as an escort in his native france .
he sees up to five clients per day , but says demand is erratic and unpredictable .
" sometimes it 's really busy , sometimes you have no clients all week - that 's what i do n't like about it , " he says .
" it is often quiet just before christmas and new year 's eve , then busy again straight afterwards . "
when asked how much he makes as an escort , luca says : " enough . "
" i 'm not someone who is into expensive clothes , big flat screen tvs or whatever people get credit cards for , " he adds .
" and i can afford to take time off . "
women murdered on 17 december dozens of sex workers sang carols in the pubs and streets of soho , central london , to mark the annual international day to end violence against sex workers .
it marked the second anniversary of the deaths of five prostitutes in suffolk , whose bodies were dumped around ipswich .
steve wright , from ipswich , is serving a life sentence for their murder .
the iusw 's catherine stephens criticised government plans to outlaw all kerb-crawling and to make it illegal to buy sex from anyone who is " controlled for gain " .
" it will drive sex work further underground , exposing sex workers to greater risk of exploitation and violence , " she said .
" the government should completely decriminalise prostitution so they can then distinguish between good and bad practice in sex work .
" that is the only way to prevent trafficking and protect sex workers . "

advertisement the card milly has designed for great ormond street hospital has become a best seller by anna-marie lever bbc news health reporter according to card aid the average person buys 30 christmas cards at this time of year .
if these are what the charity calls ' real charity cards ' they can make a difference .
" thirty cards could restore the sight of a child born with cataracts , " says dame hilary blume , director of the charities advisory trust , of which card aid is an initiative .
" the problem is that some main high street shops are making a sham out of the charity christmas card .
" this year , more than ever , they are offering discounts - you can buy charity cards for as little as 5p , which means that less than half a penny a card goes to charity . "
as well as calling for a sensible premium to send a charity card , the charities advisory trust is campaigning for legislation to ensure that a card can only be given the charity label if more than 10 % of the price actually goes to charity .
" currently , if the sale of a card gives as little as a farthing to charity it can call itself a charity card , " said dame hilary .
card aid , a not for profit organisation , gives the charity 40 % -60 % of the sale of the card to charity .
another way to ensure you are buying a ' real charity card ' is to go directly to the charity .
the snowman every year the great ormond street hospital -lrb- gosh -rrb- shop sells their own charity cards .
" all the proceeds of our charity cards come back to the hospital , " said hannah sturrock , from the great ormond street hospital children 's charity .
" we manage to keep the costs down on the production of the cards through a good relationship with our publishers and printing the cards en masse .
i did n't think it would become a best seller milly , gosh patient " all the proceeds from the cards go directly to the charity and fund pioneering research , life-saving equipment , accommodation for parents and the rebuild and refurbishment of the hospital . "
included in this year 's card selection is a smiley snowman card designed by 10 year old patient milly .
" i did n't think it would become a best seller , " she giggles , " my mum has brought millions of them ... tonnes of them . "
best sellers thomas bates , manager at the almanac gallery , a christmas charity card publisher explains : " patient designed cards will always sell a certain amount because some supporters will appreciate the deeper and direct connection to the charity .
sylvia smith , who had a stroke two years ago , designed this best seller " however , when the design works well in its own right then it will become a best seller as it offers double value , and will be bought by some on design value alone . "
another successful patient designed christmas card is sylvia smith 's ' oh come all ye faithful ' for the stroke association .
sylvia had a stroke two years ago which resulted in left-side paralysis .
she has regained the ability to paint despite the fact she is left-handed .
mr bates explains how he works alongside charities to keep printing costs down and allow for maximum proceeds .
" one way is for the charity to buy cards from us wholesale and then sell their cards through mail order , website , their own shops or temporary charity christmas card outlets .
" typically a charity will be able to sell a pack of cards at a 60 % -70 % margin .
" sales through the web are increasing and obviously offer the lowest cost . "

advertisement the card milly has designed for great ormond street hospital has become a best seller by anna-marie lever bbc news health reporter according to card aid the average person buys 30 christmas cards at this time of year .
if these are what the charity calls ' real charity cards ' they can make a difference .
" thirty cards could restore the sight of a child born with cataracts , " says dame hilary blume , director of the charities advisory trust , of which card aid is an initiative .
" the problem is that some main high street shops are making a sham out of the charity christmas card .
" this year , more than ever , they are offering discounts - you can buy charity cards for as little as 5p , which means that less than half a penny a card goes to charity . "
as well as calling for a sensible premium to send a charity card , the charities advisory trust is campaigning for legislation to ensure that a card can only be given the charity label if more than 10 % of the price actually goes to charity .
" currently , if the sale of a card gives as little as a farthing to charity it can call itself a charity card , " said dame hilary .
card aid , a not for profit organisation , gives the charity 40 % -60 % of the sale of the card to charity .
another way to ensure you are buying a ' real charity card ' is to go directly to the charity .
the snowman every year the great ormond street hospital -lrb- gosh -rrb- shop sells their own charity cards .
" all the proceeds of our charity cards come back to the hospital , " said hannah sturrock , from the great ormond street hospital children 's charity .
" we manage to keep the costs down on the production of the cards through a good relationship with our publishers and printing the cards en masse .
i did n't think it would become a best seller milly , gosh patient " all the proceeds from the cards go directly to the charity and fund pioneering research , life-saving equipment , accommodation for parents and the rebuild and refurbishment of the hospital . "

the study on the state-funded privately run schools for the sutton trust education charity pointed out 72 % still did not meet government benchmarks .
it also suggested rises in achievement corresponded to falls in the proportion of pupils from deprived backgrounds .
the government says academies serve a wide range of pupils .
researchers from the institute of education in london drew together a range of previous research for their study for the sutton trust .
data misleading ?
they highlight the variable performance of academies , a type of school which the government sees as a key weapon in turning around struggling schools around .
the report points out that of the 29 academies inspected by ofsted , six were rated outstanding , 10 good but 13 satisfactory - a category it now suggests is no longer good enough .
and it warns that " academies are in danger of being regarded by politicians as a panacea for a broad range of education problems .
" given the variable performance of academies to date , conversion to an academy may not be the best route to improvement . "
ministers repeatedly point to data suggesting that academies improve at a faster rate than other similar schools in the state sector .
but the study argues that the comparison schools used in an official government report are no longer relevant to many academies .
this is because the composition of the academies ' intake in terms of social class has changed over the few years that these schools have been open , the report says .
' cancelled out ' the 24 academies in a case-study featured in this report have an average of 26.7 % of pupils getting the government 's benchmark five good gcses including english and maths .
this is important because ministers have said that schools which do not reach the 30 % benchmark by 2011 could be closed or turned into academies .
overall , the proportion of children on free school meals in academies fell from 45.3 % of pupils in 2003 - when the first wave of academies were founded - to 29 % in 2008 .
but in some schools the changes are much more dramatic than that .
in one school the free school meal rate reduced from 51 % in 2003 to 9 % in 2005 , according to the report .
the study quotes a recently published five-year evaluation of the academy programme , calling on the government to investigate whether the freedom which academies have to manage their own admission policies can serve to exclude poor children .
the sutton trust report also quotes research suggesting that when the changes in social class of the intake are taken into consideration , any additional gains in achievement are " cancelled out " .
' popular schools ' however , another researcher quoted in the report suggests that improvements in results are often down to changes in social mix of children at a school .
" successful schools tend to have a ' critical mass ' of more engaged broadly ' pro-school ' children to start with , " it says .
schools minister jim knight said : " it is important to note that the number of children on free school meals -lrb- fsm -rrb- in academies has actually risen compared to the under-performing schools they replaced .
" the fall in proportion of fsm numbers is something to celebrate because it means while the number of children on fsm has gone up so has the number from other backgrounds as well , meaning a genuinely comprehensive intake .
" the report authors welcome the fact academies are attracting a wide range of pupils .
" like them , we want poorer pupils to benefit from excellent schools on their doorsteps and that 's why we are accelerating the programme to reach our target of at least 400 academies nationally .
" on average there are three applications for every academy place - a sign they are popular with parents who shunned the schools they replaced . "
chief executive of the specialist schools and academies trust elizabeth reid said most academies were replacing poor existing schools , and were giving young people opportunities they have not previously had from local schools in their areas .
" the fact is that academies play an important role in their local communities .
as they are making a huge contribution to the revitalisation of some of the country 's poorest areas , they are working closely with parents , residents , businesses and neighbouring schools to deliver a first class education . "

the sutton trust report also quotes research suggesting that when the changes in social class of the intake are taken into consideration , any additional gains in achievement are " cancelled out " .
' popular schools ' however , another researcher quoted in the report suggests that improvements in results are often down to changes in social mix of children at a school .
" successful schools tend to have a ' critical mass ' of more engaged broadly ' pro-school ' children to start with , " it says .
schools minister jim knight said : " it is important to note that the number of children on free school meals -lrb- fsm -rrb- in academies has actually risen compared to the under-performing schools they replaced .
" the fall in proportion of fsm numbers is something to celebrate because it means while the number of children on fsm has gone up so has the number from other backgrounds as well , meaning a genuinely comprehensive intake .
" the report authors welcome the fact academies are attracting a wide range of pupils .
" like them , we want poorer pupils to benefit from excellent schools on their doorsteps and that 's why we are accelerating the programme to reach our target of at least 400 academies nationally .
" on average there are three applications for every academy place - a sign they are popular with parents who shunned the schools they replaced . "
chief executive of the specialist schools and academies trust elizabeth reid said most academies were replacing poor existing schools , and were giving young people opportunities they have not previously had from local schools in their areas .
" the fact is that academies play an important role in their local communities .
as they are making a huge contribution to the revitalisation of some of the country 's poorest areas , they are working closely with parents , residents , businesses and neighbouring schools to deliver a first class education . "

the study on the state-funded privately run schools for the sutton trust education charity pointed out 72 % still did not meet government benchmarks .
it also suggested rises in achievement corresponded to falls in the proportion of pupils from deprived backgrounds .
the government says academies serve a wide range of pupils .
researchers from the institute of education in london drew together a range of previous research for their study for the sutton trust .
data misleading ?
they highlight the variable performance of academies , a type of school which the government sees as a key weapon in turning around struggling schools around .
the report points out that of the 29 academies inspected by ofsted , six were rated outstanding , 10 good but 13 satisfactory - a category it now suggests is no longer good enough .
and it warns that " academies are in danger of being regarded by politicians as a panacea for a broad range of education problems .
" given the variable performance of academies to date , conversion to an academy may not be the best route to improvement . "
ministers repeatedly point to data suggesting that academies improve at a faster rate than other similar schools in the state sector .
but the study argues that the comparison schools used in an official government report are no longer relevant to many academies .
this is because the composition of the academies ' intake in terms of social class has changed over the few years that these schools have been open , the report says .
' cancelled out ' the 24 academies in a case-study featured in this report have an average of 26.7 % of pupils getting the government 's benchmark five good gcses including english and maths .
this is important because ministers have said that schools which do not reach the 30 % benchmark by 2011 could be closed or turned into academies .
overall , the proportion of children on free school meals in academies fell from 45.3 % of pupils in 2003 - when the first wave of academies were founded - to 29 % in 2008 .
but in some schools the changes are much more dramatic than that .

the study on the state-funded privately run schools for the sutton trust education charity pointed out 72 % still did not meet government benchmarks .
it also suggested rises in achievement corresponded to falls in the proportion of pupils from deprived backgrounds .
the government says academies serve a wide range of pupils .
researchers from the institute of education in london drew together a range of previous research for their study for the sutton trust .
data misleading ?
they highlight the variable performance of academies , a type of school which the government sees as a key weapon in turning around struggling schools around .
the report points out that of the 29 academies inspected by ofsted , six were rated outstanding , 10 good but 13 satisfactory - a category it now suggests is no longer good enough .
and it warns that " academies are in danger of being regarded by politicians as a panacea for a broad range of education problems .
" given the variable performance of academies to date , conversion to an academy may not be the best route to improvement . "
ministers repeatedly point to data suggesting that academies improve at a faster rate than other similar schools in the state sector .
but the study argues that the comparison schools used in an official government report are no longer relevant to many academies .
this is because the composition of the academies ' intake in terms of social class has changed over the few years that these schools have been open , the report says .
' cancelled out ' the 24 academies in a case-study featured in this report have an average of 26.7 % of pupils getting the government 's benchmark five good gcses including english and maths .
this is important because ministers have said that schools which do not reach the 30 % benchmark by 2011 could be closed or turned into academies .
overall , the proportion of children on free school meals in academies fell from 45.3 % of pupils in 2003 - when the first wave of academies were founded - to 29 % in 2008 .
but in some schools the changes are much more dramatic than that .
in one school the free school meal rate reduced from 51 % in 2003 to 9 % in 2005 , according to the report .
the study quotes a recently published five-year evaluation of the academy programme , calling on the government to investigate whether the freedom which academies have to manage their own admission policies can serve to exclude poor children .
the sutton trust report also quotes research suggesting that when the changes in social class of the intake are taken into consideration , any additional gains in achievement are " cancelled out " .
' popular schools ' however , another researcher quoted in the report suggests that improvements in results are often down to changes in social mix of children at a school .
" successful schools tend to have a ' critical mass ' of more engaged broadly ' pro-school ' children to start with , " it says .
schools minister jim knight said : " it is important to note that the number of children on free school meals -lrb- fsm -rrb- in academies has actually risen compared to the under-performing schools they replaced .
" the fall in proportion of fsm numbers is something to celebrate because it means while the number of children on fsm has gone up so has the number from other backgrounds as well , meaning a genuinely comprehensive intake .
" the report authors welcome the fact academies are attracting a wide range of pupils .
" like them , we want poorer pupils to benefit from excellent schools on their doorsteps and that 's why we are accelerating the programme to reach our target of at least 400 academies nationally .
" on average there are three applications for every academy place - a sign they are popular with parents who shunned the schools they replaced . "
chief executive of the specialist schools and academies trust elizabeth reid said most academies were replacing poor existing schools , and were giving young people opportunities they have not previously had from local schools in their areas .
" the fact is that academies play an important role in their local communities .
as they are making a huge contribution to the revitalisation of some of the country 's poorest areas , they are working closely with parents , residents , businesses and neighbouring schools to deliver a first class education . "

joe cawse , who has been on a donor waiting list for more than three years , met ms cruz while she filmed in london .
the star joined the anthony nolan trust 's national bone marrow campaign after meeting their courier on a flight from madrid to london .
the courier was delivering bone marrow for another youngster in the uk .
ms cruz wanted to help other patients who could not find donors and the trust arranged her meeting with joe , from maidstone .
she said : " he 's a sunny and intelligent eight-year-old but is battling with leukaemia as i speak .
" one suitable donor could save his life . "
" if only more people in the uk knew that there is a method of donating bone marrow that is simple and pain free " penelope cruz she added : " i was very surprised to discover there are two different ways to donate your bone marrow and the second way is a much easier , less invasive process than i had ever imagined .
" if only more people in the uk knew that there is a method of donating bone marrow that is simple and pain free . "
a spokesperson for the charity said more than 1,300 patients in the uk search for a suitable bone marrow donor each year but because individual genetic make-up is so varied the chances of finding a match are slim .
people who register as a donor have to give a blood sample , which is tested to establish the tissue type .
the results are stored by the charity in case a patient with a match requires a donation .
joe 's mother , sheriden , said his diagnosis led to a " truly horrendous and terrifying few years " .
" we were told that a bone marrow transplant was joe 's only option , but a donor has n't been found yet , " she said .
" joe 's prognosis was two years , but that was three years ago so we 've beaten that .
" joe was so excited about meeting penelope cruz - she was really warm and friendly and seemed to understand the issues facing families like us . "

they say 7,000 extra places are needed across london over the next four years .
the government said there was record investment in education and schools and councils must " use the money well " .
but the situation was " very serious " , according to jason stacey from london councils , which lobbies the government on behalf of the 33 local authorities .
" there is simply not the money in our capital budget to pay for expanding our primary schools , " he told bbc london .
" therefore unless we have government assistance , we are going to have two things - councils having to borrow lots of money in order to fund this , or we 're going to have parents not able to get their children into primary school . "
' very , very concerned ' only two boroughs have secured additional government funding to pay for the temporary classrooms needed to house the extra pupils .
others have been spending money which was supposed to go towards new buildings or the refurbishment of existing schools .
the rise in demand for places is being attributed to the increasing birth rate in london .
there have been 21,000 more births in the past six years than had been predicted , figures from the office of national statistics suggest .
and the national union of teachers fears that having bigger class sizes will have a detrimental effect on children who do manage to find places in schools .
" we 're very , very concerned about it , " said tim harrison , the union 's london secretary .
" in the past , this has meant things like temporary classrooms and it 's meant oversized classes . "
' show results ' but schools secretary ed balls said more education funding than ever was being allocated to london 's councils .
" my challenge to local authorities is use this money well so that you can raise standards in every school for every child , " he told bbc london .
" there 's record investment , but to justify keeping that record investment coming in , as i am determined to do , you 've got to show results .
" that 's down to the schools and local authorities in london to really use the money well . "

advertisement more school places needed more than two-thirds of london councils are struggling to provide sufficient primary school places to meet demand , a bbc london investigation has found .
classes are full in at least 24 of the 33 local authorities and the councils claim they face a collective shortfall of £ 500 million in government funding .
they say 7,000 extra places are needed across london over the next four years .
the government said there was record investment in education and schools and councils must " use the money well " .
but the situation was " very serious " , according to jason stacey from london councils , which lobbies the government on behalf of the 33 local authorities .
" there is simply not the money in our capital budget to pay for expanding our primary schools , " he told bbc london .
" therefore unless we have government assistance , we are going to have two things - councils having to borrow lots of money in order to fund this , or we 're going to have parents not able to get their children into primary school . "
' very , very concerned ' only two boroughs have secured additional government funding to pay for the temporary classrooms needed to house the extra pupils .
others have been spending money which was supposed to go towards new buildings or the refurbishment of existing schools .
councils needed to " use money well " , schools secretary ed balls insisted the rise in demand for places is being attributed to the increasing birth rate in london .
there have been 21,000 more births in the past six years than had been predicted , figures from the office of national statistics suggest .
and the national union of teachers fears that having bigger class sizes will have a detrimental effect on children who do manage to find places in schools .
" we 're very , very concerned about it , " said tim harrison , the union 's london secretary .
" in the past , this has meant things like temporary classrooms and it 's meant oversized classes . "
' show results ' but schools secretary ed balls said more education funding than ever was being allocated to london 's councils .
" my challenge to local authorities is use this money well so that you can raise standards in every school for every child , " he told bbc london .
" there 's record investment , but to justify keeping that record investment coming in , as i am determined to do , you 've got to show results .
" that 's down to the schools and local authorities in london to really use the money well . "

advertisement more school places needed more than two-thirds of london councils are struggling to provide sufficient primary school places to meet demand , a bbc london investigation has found .
classes are full in at least 24 of the 33 local authorities and the councils claim they face a collective shortfall of £ 500 million in government funding .
they say 7,000 extra places are needed across london over the next four years .
the government said there was record investment in education and schools and councils must " use the money well " .
but the situation was " very serious " , according to jason stacey from london councils , which lobbies the government on behalf of the 33 local authorities .
" there is simply not the money in our capital budget to pay for expanding our primary schools , " he told bbc london .
" therefore unless we have government assistance , we are going to have two things - councils having to borrow lots of money in order to fund this , or we 're going to have parents not able to get their children into primary school . "
' very , very concerned ' only two boroughs have secured additional government funding to pay for the temporary classrooms needed to house the extra pupils .
others have been spending money which was supposed to go towards new buildings or the refurbishment of existing schools .
councils needed to " use money well " , schools secretary ed balls insisted the rise in demand for places is being attributed to the increasing birth rate in london .
there have been 21,000 more births in the past six years than had been predicted , figures from the office of national statistics suggest .
and the national union of teachers fears that having bigger class sizes will have a detrimental effect on children who do manage to find places in schools .
" we 're very , very concerned about it , " said tim harrison , the union 's london secretary .
" in the past , this has meant things like temporary classrooms and it 's meant oversized classes . "
' show results ' but schools secretary ed balls said more education funding than ever was being allocated to london 's councils .
" my challenge to local authorities is use this money well so that you can raise standards in every school for every child , " he told bbc london .
" there 's record investment , but to justify keeping that record investment coming in , as i am determined to do , you 've got to show results .
" that 's down to the schools and local authorities in london to really use the money well . "

joe cawse , who has been on a donor waiting list for more than three years , met ms cruz while she filmed in london .
the star joined the anthony nolan trust 's national bone marrow campaign after meeting their courier on a flight from madrid to london .
the courier was delivering bone marrow for another youngster in the uk .
ms cruz wanted to help other patients who could not find donors and the trust arranged her meeting with joe , from maidstone .
she said : " he 's a sunny and intelligent eight-year-old but is battling with leukaemia as i speak .
" one suitable donor could save his life . "
if only more people in the uk knew that there is a method of donating bone marrow that is simple and pain free penelope cruz she added : " i was very surprised to discover there are two different ways to donate your bone marrow and the second way is a much easier , less invasive process than i had ever imagined .
" if only more people in the uk knew that there is a method of donating bone marrow that is simple and pain free . "
a spokesperson for the charity said more than 1,300 patients in the uk search for a suitable bone marrow donor each year but because individual genetic make-up is so varied the chances of finding a match are slim .
people who register as a donor have to give a blood sample , which is tested to establish the tissue type .
the results are stored by the charity in case a patient with a match requires a donation .
joe 's mother , sheriden , said his diagnosis led to a " truly horrendous and terrifying few years " .
" we were told that a bone marrow transplant was joe 's only option , but a donor has n't been found yet , " she said .
" joe 's prognosis was two years , but that was three years ago so we 've beaten that .
" joe was so excited about meeting penelope cruz - she was really warm and friendly and seemed to understand the issues facing families like us . "

joe cawse , who has been on a donor waiting list for more than three years , met ms cruz while she filmed in london .
the star joined the anthony nolan trust 's national bone marrow campaign after meeting their courier on a flight from madrid to london .
the courier was delivering bone marrow for another youngster in the uk .
ms cruz wanted to help other patients who could not find donors and the trust arranged her meeting with joe , from maidstone .
she said : " he 's a sunny and intelligent eight-year-old but is battling with leukaemia as i speak .
" one suitable donor could save his life . "

a spokesperson for the charity said more than 1,300 patients in the uk search for a suitable bone marrow donor each year but because individual genetic make-up is so varied the chances of finding a match are slim .
people who register as a donor have to give a blood sample , which is tested to establish the tissue type .
the results are stored by the charity in case a patient with a match requires a donation .

joe cawse , who has been on a donor waiting list for more than three years , met ms cruz while she filmed in london .
the star joined the anthony nolan trust 's national bone marrow campaign after meeting their courier on a flight from madrid to london .
the courier was delivering bone marrow for another youngster in the uk .
ms cruz wanted to help other patients who could not find donors and the trust arranged her meeting with joe , from maidstone .
she said : " he 's a sunny and intelligent eight-year-old but is battling with leukaemia as i speak .
" one suitable donor could save his life . "
if only more people in the uk knew that there is a method of donating bone marrow that is simple and pain free penelope cruz she added : " i was very surprised to discover there are two different ways to donate your bone marrow and the second way is a much easier , less invasive process than i had ever imagined .
" if only more people in the uk knew that there is a method of donating bone marrow that is simple and pain free . "
a spokesperson for the charity said more than 1,300 patients in the uk search for a suitable bone marrow donor each year but because individual genetic make-up is so varied the chances of finding a match are slim .
people who register as a donor have to give a blood sample , which is tested to establish the tissue type .
the results are stored by the charity in case a patient with a match requires a donation .
joe 's mother , sheriden , said his diagnosis led to a " truly horrendous and terrifying few years " .
" we were told that a bone marrow transplant was joe 's only option , but a donor has n't been found yet , " she said .
" joe 's prognosis was two years , but that was three years ago so we 've beaten that .
" joe was so excited about meeting penelope cruz - she was really warm and friendly and seemed to understand the issues facing families like us . "

there is no cure .
it is estimated that 2-5 % of people over 65 years of age and up to 20 % of those over 85 years of age suffer from the disease .
what is dementia ?
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
alzheimer 's disease is one cause of dementia , but several other diseases can cause it too , including vascular disease .
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , accounting for around two thirds of cases in the elderly .
what causes alzheimer 's ?
the causes of alzheimer 's disease are not yet fully understood .
there are some very rare inherited cases caused by genetic mutations , but these account for around 1 % of people with alzheimer 's .
for most cases , there is a complex interaction of many genetic , environmental and life-style risk factors , with age and genetics playing the largest part .
some factors , such as a well-balanced diet and regular physical and mental exercise can reduce the risk of developing alzheimer 's .
protein deposits , known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles , appear and spread in the brain , particularly in the cortex and the hippocampus .
the levels of important chemical transmitters , such as acetylcholine , are reduced .
many of the blood vessels of the brain are also damaged .
these processes are made worse by chronic inflammation in the brain and by an excess of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals , which damage brain tissue .
gradually the connections between brain cells are lost and eventually many of the cells themselves die .
it is particularly the loss of connections between brain cells that is thought to cause the devastating symptoms of the disease .
what are the symptoms ?
alzheimer 's disease has a gradual onset .
the early stages of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are initially subtle or common to other illnesses .
well established features of the disease include : problems with memory poor or decreased judgement difficulty in performing everyday tasks problems with language disorientation in time and place problems with abstract thinking change in mood and behaviour change in personality loss of initiative the disease is often associated with depression , anxiety and sleep disturbance .
the rate of decline varies from patient to patient .
the disease course runs anywhere from three to twenty years , with eight years being the average life span after diagnosis .
how is the disease diagnosed ?
there is no single diagnostic test for alzheimer 's disease .
experts are able to observe the pattern of symptoms and perform a few simple tests over a period of time to measure any change .
although the tests currently performed are fairly accurate , a definitive diagnosis can still only be made after death by examining the brain tissue at post mortem .
early diagnosis is important because it helps a doctor to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms to dementia , such as depression .
it also enables new drugs to be prescribed which can improve the quality of life for both patient and carer .
many other disease processes can mimic alzheimer 's such as thyroid imbalances , vitamin b12 deficiency , brain injuries , tumours , and severe depression .
what are memory clinics ?
specialist memory clinics operate throughout the county and offer assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
the assessment includes formal neuropsychological testing in the form of structured questions and tasks .
the experts may also carry out blood tests to look for medical causes .
the staff can offer counselling and support as well as treatment .
are there other types of dementia ?
yes .
these include dementia with lewy bodies , which gets its name from tiny structures that develop inside nerve cells , and which trigger the degeneration of brain tissue .
other rarer causes of dementia include progressive supranuclear palsy , korsakoff 's syndrome , binswanger 's disease , hiv and creutzfeldt-jakob disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
people with multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease can also be at an increased risk .
what treatment is available ?
various types of therapy are used to try to stimulate alzheimer 's patients .
these include : psychological methods , art therapy , music therapy , playing with toys .
some health professionals try to encourage patients to reminisce about past memories as a way to reduce depression without the use of drugs .
a variety of drug treatments have been shown to benefit patients .
none are a cure , but they can temporarily relieve some of the symptoms in some patients : cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil -lrb- aricept -rrb- , galantamine -lrb- reminyl -rrb- and rivastigmine -lrb- exelon -rrb- nmda receptor antagonist , namely memantine -lrb- ebixa -rrb- neuroleptics , also known as anti-psychotics or major tranquillisers - although these drugs are only used as a last resort when other methods have failed antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs is there controversy over availability of drugs ?
most certainly .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- says that donepezil , rivastigmine and galantamine should only be used to treat alzheimer 's once it has progressed to its moderate stages .
memantine is not recommended as an option for people with moderately severe to severe alzheimer 's disease unless it is being used as part of a clinical trial .
campaigners argue patients in the early stages of alzheimer 's should also have access to the drugs .

there is no cure .
it is estimated that 2-5 % of people over 65 years of age and up to 20 % of those over 85 years of age suffer from the disease .
what is dementia ?
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
alzheimer 's disease is one cause of dementia , but several other diseases can cause it too , including vascular disease .
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , accounting for around two thirds of cases in the elderly .
what causes alzheimer 's ?
the causes of alzheimer 's disease are not yet fully understood .
there are some very rare inherited cases caused by genetic mutations , but these account for around 1 % of people with alzheimer 's .
for most cases , there is a complex interaction of many genetic , environmental and life-style risk factors , with age and genetics playing the largest part .
some factors , such as a well-balanced diet and regular physical and mental exercise can reduce the risk of developing alzheimer 's .
protein deposits , known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles , appear and spread in the brain , particularly in the cortex and the hippocampus .
the levels of important chemical transmitters , such as acetylcholine , are reduced .
many of the blood vessels of the brain are also damaged .
these processes are made worse by chronic inflammation in the brain and by an excess of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals , which damage brain tissue .
gradually the connections between brain cells are lost and eventually many of the cells themselves die .
it is particularly the loss of connections between brain cells that is thought to cause the devastating symptoms of the disease .
what are the symptoms ?
alzheimer 's disease has a gradual onset .
the early stages of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are initially subtle or common to other illnesses .
well established features of the disease include : problems with memory poor or decreased judgement difficulty in performing everyday tasks problems with language disorientation in time and place problems with abstract thinking change in mood and behaviour change in personality loss of initiative the disease is often associated with depression , anxiety and sleep disturbance .
the rate of decline varies from patient to patient .
the disease course runs anywhere from three to twenty years , with eight years being the average life span after diagnosis .
how is the disease diagnosed ?
there is no single diagnostic test for alzheimer 's disease .
experts are able to observe the pattern of symptoms and perform a few simple tests over a period of time to measure any change .
although the tests currently performed are fairly accurate , a definitive diagnosis can still only be made after death by examining the brain tissue at post mortem .
early diagnosis is important because it helps a doctor to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms to dementia , such as depression .
it also enables new drugs to be prescribed which can improve the quality of life for both patient and carer .
many other disease processes can mimic alzheimer 's such as thyroid imbalances , vitamin b12 deficiency , brain injuries , tumours , and severe depression .
what are memory clinics ?
specialist memory clinics operate throughout the county and offer assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
the assessment includes formal neuropsychological testing in the form of structured questions and tasks .
the experts may also carry out blood tests to look for medical causes .
the staff can offer counselling and support as well as treatment .
are there other types of dementia ?
yes .
these include dementia with lewy bodies , which gets its name from tiny structures that develop inside nerve cells , and which trigger the degeneration of brain tissue .
other rarer causes of dementia include progressive supranuclear palsy , korsakoff 's syndrome , binswanger 's disease , hiv and creutzfeldt-jakob disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
people with multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease can also be at an increased risk .
what treatment is available ?
various types of therapy are used to try to stimulate alzheimer 's patients .
these include : psychological methods , art therapy , music therapy , playing with toys .
some health professionals try to encourage patients to reminisce about past memories as a way to reduce depression without the use of drugs .
a variety of drug treatments have been shown to benefit patients .
none are a cure , but they can temporarily relieve some of the symptoms in some patients : cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil -lrb- aricept -rrb- , galantamine -lrb- reminyl -rrb- and rivastigmine -lrb- exelon -rrb- nmda receptor antagonist , namely memantine -lrb- ebixa -rrb- neuroleptics , also known as anti-psychotics or major tranquillisers - although these drugs are only used as a last resort when other methods have failed antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs is there controversy over availability of drugs ?
most certainly .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- says that donepezil , rivastigmine and galantamine should only be used to treat alzheimer 's once it has progressed to its moderate stages .
memantine is not recommended as an option for people with moderately severe to severe alzheimer 's disease unless it is being used as part of a clinical trial .
campaigners argue patients in the early stages of alzheimer 's should also have access to the drugs .

there is no cure .
it is estimated that 2-5 % of people over 65 years of age and up to 20 % of those over 85 years of age suffer from the disease .
what is dementia ?
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
alzheimer 's disease is one cause of dementia , but several other diseases can cause it too , including vascular disease .
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , accounting for around two thirds of cases in the elderly .
what causes alzheimer 's ?
the causes of alzheimer 's disease are not yet fully understood .
there are some very rare inherited cases caused by genetic mutations , but these account for around 1 % of people with alzheimer 's .
for most cases , there is a complex interaction of many genetic , environmental and life-style risk factors , with age and genetics playing the largest part .
some factors , such as a well-balanced diet and regular physical and mental exercise can reduce the risk of developing alzheimer 's .
protein deposits , known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles , appear and spread in the brain , particularly in the cortex and the hippocampus .
the levels of important chemical transmitters , such as acetylcholine , are reduced .
many of the blood vessels of the brain are also damaged .
these processes are made worse by chronic inflammation in the brain and by an excess of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals , which damage brain tissue .
gradually the connections between brain cells are lost and eventually many of the cells themselves die .
it is particularly the loss of connections between brain cells that is thought to cause the devastating symptoms of the disease .
what are the symptoms ?
alzheimer 's disease has a gradual onset .
the early stages of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are initially subtle or common to other illnesses .
well established features of the disease include : problems with memory poor or decreased judgement difficulty in performing everyday tasks problems with language disorientation in time and place problems with abstract thinking change in mood and behaviour change in personality loss of initiative the disease is often associated with depression , anxiety and sleep disturbance .
the rate of decline varies from patient to patient .
the disease course runs anywhere from three to twenty years , with eight years being the average life span after diagnosis .
how is the disease diagnosed ?
there is no single diagnostic test for alzheimer 's disease .
experts are able to observe the pattern of symptoms and perform a few simple tests over a period of time to measure any change .
although the tests currently performed are fairly accurate , a definitive diagnosis can still only be made after death by examining the brain tissue at post mortem .
early diagnosis is important because it helps a doctor to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms to dementia , such as depression .
it also enables new drugs to be prescribed which can improve the quality of life for both patient and carer .
many other disease processes can mimic alzheimer 's such as thyroid imbalances , vitamin b12 deficiency , brain injuries , tumours , and severe depression .
what are memory clinics ?
specialist memory clinics operate throughout the county and offer assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
the assessment includes formal neuropsychological testing in the form of structured questions and tasks .
the experts may also carry out blood tests to look for medical causes .
the staff can offer counselling and support as well as treatment .
are there other types of dementia ?
yes .
these include dementia with lewy bodies , which gets its name from tiny structures that develop inside nerve cells , and which trigger the degeneration of brain tissue .
other rarer causes of dementia include progressive supranuclear palsy , korsakoff 's syndrome , binswanger 's disease , hiv and creutzfeldt-jakob disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
people with multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease can also be at an increased risk .
what treatment is available ?
various types of therapy are used to try to stimulate alzheimer 's patients .
these include : psychological methods , art therapy , music therapy , playing with toys .
some health professionals try to encourage patients to reminisce about past memories as a way to reduce depression without the use of drugs .
a variety of drug treatments have been shown to benefit patients .
none are a cure , but they can temporarily relieve some of the symptoms in some patients : cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil -lrb- aricept -rrb- , galantamine -lrb- reminyl -rrb- and rivastigmine -lrb- exelon -rrb- nmda receptor antagonist , namely memantine -lrb- ebixa -rrb- neuroleptics , also known as anti-psychotics or major tranquillisers - although these drugs are only used as a last resort when other methods have failed antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs is there controversy over availability of drugs ?
most certainly .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- says that donepezil , rivastigmine and galantamine should only be used to treat alzheimer 's once it has progressed to its moderate stages .
memantine is not recommended as an option for people with moderately severe to severe alzheimer 's disease unless it is being used as part of a clinical trial .
campaigners argue patients in the early stages of alzheimer 's should also have access to the drugs .
this page contains basic information .
if you are concerned about your health , you should consult a doctor .
the alzheimer 's society runs a helpline on 0845 300 0336 and further information is also available free from the alzheimer 's research trust on 01223 843899 .

there is no cure .
it is estimated that 2-5 % of people over 65 years of age and up to 20 % of those over 85 years of age suffer from the disease .
what is dementia ?
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
alzheimer 's disease is one cause of dementia , but several other diseases can cause it too , including vascular disease .
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , accounting for around two thirds of cases in the elderly .
what causes alzheimer 's ?
the causes of alzheimer 's disease are not yet fully understood .
there are some very rare inherited cases caused by genetic mutations , but these account for around 1 % of people with alzheimer 's .
for most cases , there is a complex interaction of many genetic , environmental and life-style risk factors , with age and genetics playing the largest part .
some factors , such as a well-balanced diet and regular physical and mental exercise can reduce the risk of developing alzheimer 's .
protein deposits , known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles , appear and spread in the brain , particularly in the cortex and the hippocampus .
the levels of important chemical transmitters , such as acetylcholine , are reduced .
many of the blood vessels of the brain are also damaged .
these processes are made worse by chronic inflammation in the brain and by an excess of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals , which damage brain tissue .
gradually the connections between brain cells are lost and eventually many of the cells themselves die .
it is particularly the loss of connections between brain cells that is thought to cause the devastating symptoms of the disease .
what are the symptoms ?
alzheimer 's disease has a gradual onset .
the early stages of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are initially subtle or common to other illnesses .
well established features of the disease include : problems with memory poor or decreased judgement difficulty in performing everyday tasks problems with language disorientation in time and place problems with abstract thinking change in mood and behaviour change in personality loss of initiative the disease is often associated with depression , anxiety and sleep disturbance .
the rate of decline varies from patient to patient .
the disease course runs anywhere from three to twenty years , with eight years being the average life span after diagnosis .
how is the disease diagnosed ?
there is no single diagnostic test for alzheimer 's disease .
experts are able to observe the pattern of symptoms and perform a few simple tests over a period of time to measure any change .
although the tests currently performed are fairly accurate , a definitive diagnosis can still only be made after death by examining the brain tissue at post mortem .
early diagnosis is important because it helps a doctor to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms to dementia , such as depression .
it also enables new drugs to be prescribed which can improve the quality of life for both patient and carer .
many other disease processes can mimic alzheimer 's such as thyroid imbalances , vitamin b12 deficiency , brain injuries , tumours , and severe depression .
what are memory clinics ?
specialist memory clinics operate throughout the county and offer assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
the assessment includes formal neuropsychological testing in the form of structured questions and tasks .
the experts may also carry out blood tests to look for medical causes .
the staff can offer counselling and support as well as treatment .
are there other types of dementia ?
yes .
these include dementia with lewy bodies , which gets its name from tiny structures that develop inside nerve cells , and which trigger the degeneration of brain tissue .
other rarer causes of dementia include progressive supranuclear palsy , korsakoff 's syndrome , binswanger 's disease , hiv and creutzfeldt-jakob disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
people with multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease can also be at an increased risk .
what treatment is available ?
various types of therapy are used to try to stimulate alzheimer 's patients .
these include : psychological methods , art therapy , music therapy , playing with toys .
some health professionals try to encourage patients to reminisce about past memories as a way to reduce depression without the use of drugs .
a variety of drug treatments have been shown to benefit patients .
none are a cure , but they can temporarily relieve some of the symptoms in some patients : cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil -lrb- aricept -rrb- , galantamine -lrb- reminyl -rrb- and rivastigmine -lrb- exelon -rrb- nmda receptor antagonist , namely memantine -lrb- ebixa -rrb- neuroleptics , also known as anti-psychotics or major tranquillisers - although these drugs are only used as a last resort when other methods have failed antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs is there controversy over availability of drugs ?
most certainly .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- says that donepezil , rivastigmine and galantamine should only be used to treat alzheimer 's once it has progressed to its moderate stages .
memantine is not recommended as an option for people with moderately severe to severe alzheimer 's disease unless it is being used as part of a clinical trial .
campaigners argue patients in the early stages of alzheimer 's should also have access to the drugs .
this page contains basic information .
if you are concerned about your health , you should consult a doctor .
the alzheimer 's society runs a helpline on 0845 300 0336 and further information is also available free from the alzheimer 's research trust on 01223 843899 .

there is no cure .
it is estimated that 2-5 % of people over 65 years of age and up to 20 % of those over 85 years of age suffer from the disease .
what is dementia ?
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
alzheimer 's disease is one cause of dementia , but several other diseases can cause it too , including vascular disease .
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , accounting for around two thirds of cases in the elderly .
what causes alzheimer 's ?
the causes of alzheimer 's disease are not yet fully understood .
there are some very rare inherited cases caused by genetic mutations , but these account for around 1 % of people with alzheimer 's .
for most cases , there is a complex interaction of many genetic , environmental and life-style risk factors , with age and genetics playing the largest part .
some factors , such as a well-balanced diet and regular physical and mental exercise can reduce the risk of developing alzheimer 's .
protein deposits , known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles , appear and spread in the brain , particularly in the cortex and the hippocampus .
the levels of important chemical transmitters , such as acetylcholine , are reduced .
many of the blood vessels of the brain are also damaged .
these processes are made worse by chronic inflammation in the brain and by an excess of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals , which damage brain tissue .
gradually the connections between brain cells are lost and eventually many of the cells themselves die .
it is particularly the loss of connections between brain cells that is thought to cause the devastating symptoms of the disease .
what are the symptoms ?
alzheimer 's disease has a gradual onset .
the early stages of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are initially subtle or common to other illnesses .
well established features of the disease include : problems with memory poor or decreased judgement difficulty in performing everyday tasks problems with language disorientation in time and place problems with abstract thinking change in mood and behaviour change in personality loss of initiative the disease is often associated with depression , anxiety and sleep disturbance .
the rate of decline varies from patient to patient .
the disease course runs anywhere from three to twenty years , with eight years being the average life span after diagnosis .
how is the disease diagnosed ?
there is no single diagnostic test for alzheimer 's disease .
experts are able to observe the pattern of symptoms and perform a few simple tests over a period of time to measure any change .
although the tests currently performed are fairly accurate , a definitive diagnosis can still only be made after death by examining the brain tissue at post mortem .
early diagnosis is important because it helps a doctor to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms to dementia , such as depression .
it also enables new drugs to be prescribed which can improve the quality of life for both patient and carer .
many other disease processes can mimic alzheimer 's such as thyroid imbalances , vitamin b12 deficiency , brain injuries , tumours , and severe depression .
what are memory clinics ?
specialist memory clinics operate throughout the county and offer assessment , support , information and advice to those with memory problems and their carers .
the assessment includes formal neuropsychological testing in the form of structured questions and tasks .
the experts may also carry out blood tests to look for medical causes .
the staff can offer counselling and support as well as treatment .
are there other types of dementia ?
yes .
these include dementia with lewy bodies , which gets its name from tiny structures that develop inside nerve cells , and which trigger the degeneration of brain tissue .
other rarer causes of dementia include progressive supranuclear palsy , korsakoff 's syndrome , binswanger 's disease , hiv and creutzfeldt-jakob disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
people with multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease can also be at an increased risk .
what treatment is available ?
various types of therapy are used to try to stimulate alzheimer 's patients .
these include : psychological methods , art therapy , music therapy , playing with toys .
some health professionals try to encourage patients to reminisce about past memories as a way to reduce depression without the use of drugs .
a variety of drug treatments have been shown to benefit patients .
none are a cure , but they can temporarily relieve some of the symptoms in some patients : cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil -lrb- aricept -rrb- , galantamine -lrb- reminyl -rrb- and rivastigmine -lrb- exelon -rrb- nmda receptor antagonist , namely memantine -lrb- ebixa -rrb- neuroleptics , also known as anti-psychotics or major tranquillisers - although these drugs are only used as a last resort when other methods have failed antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs is there controversy over availability of drugs ?
