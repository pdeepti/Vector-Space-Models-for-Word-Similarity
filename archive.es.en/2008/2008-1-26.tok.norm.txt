27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

as the sector booms , more customers are looking for official certification labels .
but there are several types that are often confusing and sometimes even hard to find . visitors to the world 's largest agriculture fair green week , which draws to a close on sunday , jan .
27 , in berlin , will have noticed that organic food is more than just a trend .
with a market share of 4 percent , it 's even become a staple in ordinary supermarkets across europe . but the kinds of labels on food packages - both legitimate certifications and misleading advertising statements - are exploding right along with the sector . " this is confusing for the customer , " said alexander gerber from the association of ecological food in berlin . plenty of room to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even dog food has gone organic many shoppers do n't really even know what " organic " means and that keeps them from purchasing specially labeled organic products , according to a recent study by ernst & young . despite double-digit growth , the sector still has lots of potential , the study said , adding that nearly 80 percent of consumers are willing to pay more for organic products , but only 37 percent do so on a regular basis . bioland , demeter , biobio , naturkind , bio smiley - the organic brand names in germany alone can be overwhelming and packaging can be confusing . german seal means eu standards " we recommend the state certification seal , because it guarantees that the product you 're buying really is organic , " said christiane kunzel from the consumer protection agency in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has cut subsidies for farmers to convert to organic production germany introduced a state certification in 2001 , which indicates that a product has fulfilled the european union 's minimum requirements for organic products .
everything sold in europe that is labeled with the word " organic " must meet these provisions .
labels such as " eco-friendly " and " ecologically grown " are not required to meet the regulations . to earn the " organic " designation , foodstuff sold in europe must have been product at least 95 percent organically .
they can not have been treated with genetically altered organisms , exposed to radioactive material , or fertilized with highly soluble minerals that could seep into the groundwater . people do n't buy what they ca n't see nearly all organic products are labeled with the voluntary state certification . " it 's used everywhere because it gives the customers security , " said gerber . but the devil is in the details . since food containers often get crowded with plenty of other stuff - like pictures , slogans and health promises - the state certification label tends to get relocated to the side or back of the package and customers overlook it .
thus , many do n't realize that their selection of organic items is actually larger than they think . in other european countries like britain , france , denmark and switzerland , for example , the confusion is even greater because , though they have a state organic certification , there is no common label . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : importing produce means more co2 emissions this will all change , however , in 2009 , when a common eu label is introduced for organic products - a light green circle with 12 european stars on it .
additional tags will also be introduced to indicate particularly earth-friendly or non-gm foods . next year 's eu certification comes with one slight change that has environmental groups up in arms : traces of genetically altered organisms will be permitted .
but at least consumers will be sure of what they 're putting in their shopping cart . organic from abroad is less earth-friendly but the german farming association is demanding just that , as cheap organic produce from new zealand or china is making life difficult for the local farmers .
the university of kassel has estimated that a third of organic products on the supermarket shelves in germany already come from abroad and the trend is rising . members of the farming association also question whether stringent quality controls of organic food can be maintained with so much of demand for organic products being met by foreign producers . but there are other good reasons to stick to local produce , according to kunzel .
he added that food should be evaluated by its overall ecological footprint - not conditions under which it is produced - since long-distance transport leads to harmful co2 emissions . " you have to keep the ecological picture in perspective and look at the whole production chain .
organic apples from china are seen critically because they had to be transported a long way to get here , " said kunzel . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?
with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains .

27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

as the sector booms , more customers are looking for official certification labels .
but there are several types that are often confusing and sometimes even hard to find . visitors to the world 's largest agriculture fair green week , which draws to a close on sunday , jan .
27 , in berlin , will have noticed that organic food is more than just a trend .
with a market share of 4 percent , it 's even become a staple in ordinary supermarkets across europe . but the kinds of labels on food packages - both legitimate certifications and misleading advertising statements - are exploding right along with the sector . " this is confusing for the customer , " said alexander gerber from the association of ecological food in berlin . plenty of room to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even dog food has gone organic many shoppers do n't really even know what " organic " means and that keeps them from purchasing specially labeled organic products , according to a recent study by ernst & young . despite double-digit growth , the sector still has lots of potential , the study said , adding that nearly 80 percent of consumers are willing to pay more for organic products , but only 37 percent do so on a regular basis . bioland , demeter , biobio , naturkind , bio smiley - the organic brand names in germany alone can be overwhelming and packaging can be confusing . german seal means eu standards " we recommend the state certification seal , because it guarantees that the product you 're buying really is organic , " said christiane kunzel from the consumer protection agency in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has cut subsidies for farmers to convert to organic production germany introduced a state certification in 2001 , which indicates that a product has fulfilled the european union 's minimum requirements for organic products .
everything sold in europe that is labeled with the word " organic " must meet these provisions .
labels such as " eco-friendly " and " ecologically grown " are not required to meet the regulations . to earn the " organic " designation , foodstuff sold in europe must have been product at least 95 percent organically .
they can not have been treated with genetically altered organisms , exposed to radioactive material , or fertilized with highly soluble minerals that could seep into the groundwater . people do n't buy what they ca n't see nearly all organic products are labeled with the voluntary state certification . " it 's used everywhere because it gives the customers security , " said gerber . but the devil is in the details . since food containers often get crowded with plenty of other stuff - like pictures , slogans and health promises - the state certification label tends to get relocated to the side or back of the package and customers overlook it .
thus , many do n't realize that their selection of organic items is actually larger than they think . in other european countries like britain , france , denmark and switzerland , for example , the confusion is even greater because , though they have a state organic certification , there is no common label . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : importing produce means more co2 emissions this will all change , however , in 2009 , when a common eu label is introduced for organic products - a light green circle with 12 european stars on it .
additional tags will also be introduced to indicate particularly earth-friendly or non-gm foods . next year 's eu certification comes with one slight change that has environmental groups up in arms : traces of genetically altered organisms will be permitted .
but at least consumers will be sure of what they 're putting in their shopping cart . organic from abroad is less earth-friendly but the german farming association is demanding just that , as cheap organic produce from new zealand or china is making life difficult for the local farmers .
the university of kassel has estimated that a third of organic products on the supermarket shelves in germany already come from abroad and the trend is rising . members of the farming association also question whether stringent quality controls of organic food can be maintained with so much of demand for organic products being met by foreign producers . but there are other good reasons to stick to local produce , according to kunzel .
he added that food should be evaluated by its overall ecological footprint - not conditions under which it is produced - since long-distance transport leads to harmful co2 emissions . " you have to keep the ecological picture in perspective and look at the whole production chain .
organic apples from china are seen critically because they had to be transported a long way to get here , " said kunzel . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.01.2008 dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony voters in germany 's central state of hesse and northern state of lower saxony will head to the polls on sunday , jan .
27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

25 , told journalists in vienna that they had agreed to set up a new party in order to defend europe from numerous challenges that it faces today .
" we say : patriots of all the countries of europe , unite , " freedom party leader heinz-christian strache said at the news conference , also attended by french right-winger jean-marie le pen , among others .
" because only together will we solve our problems . "
warning about the dangers that immigration and " islamization " pose for europe , the right-wing leaders said that that the new party would be based on european christian traditions across the continent - including non-eu members such as serbia and russia - and that it would fight against the eu 's centralized bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volen siderov leads bulgaria 's nationalist party attaca " it 's important to have a federation of honest europeans in europe , " said bulgarian right-winger volen siderov .
" we are for a federal europe made up of fatherlands working together … we do n't want a centralist federalized states . "
the leaders declined to name any other parties the new movement was negotiating with , but ruled out talks with german right-wing extremists npd and vdu .
the plans for a pan-european nationalist party draw a stinging rebuke from austria 's social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- who called it " completely absurd and contradictory . "
" the project of european integration is aimed at a peaceful cooperation of eu states and , without any doubt , against nationalist efforts " said elisabeth grossman , spö 's spokesperson for european affairs .

"
in order to launch a party on the european level that would receive benefits from the 27-member block , the right-wing caucus still needs to get the support of parties from three additional eu countries .
the group , however , hopes to extend their membership beyond the bare minimum and surpass the 20-seat threshold necessary to be recognized by the european parliament .
" our goal is clear , we want more than 10 parties as members and ideally one party from each eu country , " starche said .

the bloc was dissolved on nov .
14 after romanian deputies quit the group in response to racially insulting comments by an italian politician .
asked about the chances of success of the new party , le pen said " it 's not necessary to hope in order to try , nor to succeed in order to persevere . "
the new grouping does not want to see turkey become a member of the european union and vehemently opposes the efforts of the predominantly muslim kosovo albanians to secede from serbia .
the party is expected to be officially launched by november 2008 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we say : patriots of all the countries of europe , unite , " freedom party leader heinz-christian strache said at the news conference , also attended by french right-winger jean-marie le pen , among others .
" because only together will we solve our problems . "
warning about the dangers that immigration and " islamization " pose for europe , the right-wing leaders said that that the new party would be based on european christian traditions across the continent - including non-eu members such as serbia and russia - and that it would fight against the eu 's centralized bureaucracy .

the leaders declined to name any other parties the new movement was negotiating with , but ruled out talks with german right-wing extremists npd and vdu .
the plans for a pan-european nationalist party draw a stinging rebuke from austria 's social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- who called it " completely absurd and contradictory . "
" the project of european integration is aimed at a peaceful cooperation of eu states and , without any doubt , against nationalist efforts " said elisabeth grossman , spö 's spokesperson for european affairs .

in order to launch a party on the european level that would receive benefits from the 27-member block , the right-wing caucus still needs to get the support of parties from three additional eu countries .
the group , however , hopes to extend their membership beyond the bare minimum and surpass the 20-seat threshold necessary to be recognized by the european parliament .
" our goal is clear , we want more than 10 parties as members and ideally one party from each eu country , " starche said .

asked about the chances of success of the new party , le pen said " it 's not necessary to hope in order to try , nor to succeed in order to persevere . "
the new grouping does not want to see turkey become a member of the european union and vehemently opposes the efforts of the predominantly muslim kosovo albanians to secede from serbia .
the party is expected to be officially launched by november 2008 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that food should be evaluated by its overall ecological footprint - not conditions under which it is produced - since long-distance transport leads to harmful co2 emissions . " you have to keep the ecological picture in perspective and look at the whole production chain .

27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

with a market share of 4 percent , it 's even become a staple in ordinary supermarkets across europe . but the kinds of labels on food packages - both legitimate certifications and misleading advertising statements - are exploding right along with the sector .

25 , told journalists in vienna that they had agreed to set up a new party in order to defend europe from numerous challenges that it faces today .
" we say : patriots of all the countries of europe , unite , " freedom party leader heinz-christian strache said at the news conference , also attended by french right-winger jean-marie le pen , among others .
" because only together will we solve our problems . "
warning about the dangers that immigration and " islamization " pose for europe , the right-wing leaders said that that the new party would be based on european christian traditions across the continent - including non-eu members such as serbia and russia - and that it would fight against the eu 's centralized bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volen siderov leads bulgaria 's nationalist party attaca " it 's important to have a federation of honest europeans in europe , " said bulgarian right-winger volen siderov .
" we are for a federal europe made up of fatherlands working together … we do n't want a centralist federalized states . "
the leaders declined to name any other parties the new movement was negotiating with , but ruled out talks with german right-wing extremists npd and vdu .
the plans for a pan-european nationalist party draw a stinging rebuke from austria 's social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- who called it " completely absurd and contradictory . "
" the project of european integration is aimed at a peaceful cooperation of eu states and , without any doubt , against nationalist efforts " said elisabeth grossman , spö 's spokesperson for european affairs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in order to become a recognized parliamentary group , the right-wingers will need to win over at least 20 deputies the new party - which is yet to get an official name - is currently referred to as the " european patriotic party " or the european freedom party . "
in order to launch a party on the european level that would receive benefits from the 27-member block , the right-wing caucus still needs to get the support of parties from three additional eu countries .
the group , however , hopes to extend their membership beyond the bare minimum and surpass the 20-seat threshold necessary to be recognized by the european parliament .
" our goal is clear , we want more than 10 parties as members and ideally one party from each eu country , " starche said .
an extremist deja-vu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nationalists do n't want turkey to become a member of the eu a previous attempt by european right-wingers to form a european parliamentary block called identity , tradition and sovereignty -lrb- its -rrb- was short-lived because of internal disagreements .
the bloc was dissolved on nov .
14 after romanian deputies quit the group in response to racially insulting comments by an italian politician .
asked about the chances of success of the new party , le pen said " it 's not necessary to hope in order to try , nor to succeed in order to persevere . "
the new grouping does not want to see turkey become a member of the european union and vehemently opposes the efforts of the predominantly muslim kosovo albanians to secede from serbia .
the party is expected to be officially launched by november 2008 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .

the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .

the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 26.01.2008 poor labeling curbs sale of organic products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic products may be hiding in the supermarket how do you know if organic food really is organic ?
as the sector booms , more customers are looking for official certification labels .
but there are several types that are often confusing and sometimes even hard to find . visitors to the world 's largest agriculture fair green week , which draws to a close on sunday , jan .
27 , in berlin , will have noticed that organic food is more than just a trend .
with a market share of 4 percent , it 's even become a staple in ordinary supermarkets across europe . but the kinds of labels on food packages - both legitimate certifications and misleading advertising statements - are exploding right along with the sector . " this is confusing for the customer , " said alexander gerber from the association of ecological food in berlin . plenty of room to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even dog food has gone organic many shoppers do n't really even know what " organic " means and that keeps them from purchasing specially labeled organic products , according to a recent study by ernst & young . despite double-digit growth , the sector still has lots of potential , the study said , adding that nearly 80 percent of consumers are willing to pay more for organic products , but only 37 percent do so on a regular basis . bioland , demeter , biobio , naturkind , bio smiley - the organic brand names in germany alone can be overwhelming and packaging can be confusing . german seal means eu standards " we recommend the state certification seal , because it guarantees that the product you 're buying really is organic , " said christiane kunzel from the consumer protection agency in north rhine-westphalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has cut subsidies for farmers to convert to organic production germany introduced a state certification in 2001 , which indicates that a product has fulfilled the european union 's minimum requirements for organic products .
everything sold in europe that is labeled with the word " organic " must meet these provisions .
labels such as " eco-friendly " and " ecologically grown " are not required to meet the regulations . to earn the " organic " designation , foodstuff sold in europe must have been product at least 95 percent organically .
they can not have been treated with genetically altered organisms , exposed to radioactive material , or fertilized with highly soluble minerals that could seep into the groundwater . people do n't buy what they ca n't see nearly all organic products are labeled with the voluntary state certification . " it 's used everywhere because it gives the customers security , " said gerber . but the devil is in the details . since food containers often get crowded with plenty of other stuff - like pictures , slogans and health promises - the state certification label tends to get relocated to the side or back of the package and customers overlook it .
thus , many do n't realize that their selection of organic items is actually larger than they think . in other european countries like britain , france , denmark and switzerland , for example , the confusion is even greater because , though they have a state organic certification , there is no common label . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : importing produce means more co2 emissions this will all change , however , in 2009 , when a common eu label is introduced for organic products - a light green circle with 12 european stars on it .
additional tags will also be introduced to indicate particularly earth-friendly or non-gm foods . next year 's eu certification comes with one slight change that has environmental groups up in arms : traces of genetically altered organisms will be permitted .
but at least consumers will be sure of what they 're putting in their shopping cart . organic from abroad is less earth-friendly but the german farming association is demanding just that , as cheap organic produce from new zealand or china is making life difficult for the local farmers .
the university of kassel has estimated that a third of organic products on the supermarket shelves in germany already come from abroad and the trend is rising . members of the farming association also question whether stringent quality controls of organic food can be maintained with so much of demand for organic products being met by foreign producers . but there are other good reasons to stick to local produce , according to kunzel .
he added that food should be evaluated by its overall ecological footprint - not conditions under which it is produced - since long-distance transport leads to harmful co2 emissions . " you have to keep the ecological picture in perspective and look at the whole production chain .
organic apples from china are seen critically because they had to be transported a long way to get here , " said kunzel . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?
with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains .

27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

the university of kassel has estimated that a third of organic products on the supermarket shelves in germany already come from abroad and the trend is rising . members of the farming association also question whether stringent quality controls of organic food can be maintained with so much of demand for organic products being met by foreign producers . but there are other good reasons to stick to local produce , according to kunzel .
he added that food should be evaluated by its overall ecological footprint - not conditions under which it is produced - since long-distance transport leads to harmful co2 emissions . " you have to keep the ecological picture in perspective and look at the whole production chain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.01.2008 dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony voters in germany 's central state of hesse and northern state of lower saxony will head to the polls on sunday , jan .
27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

27 , to elect a new regional parliament and government . in lower saxony , premier christian wulff , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems set to remain in office with a comfortable lead over his social democratic challenger , wolfgang jüttner . virtually unknown to many voters , jüttner even attacked wulff 's personal life - an unusual step for german election campaigns - to get noticed .
wulff recently divorced his wife and his new girlfriend is pregnant .
apart from this , the state 's election campaign has made few national headlines as wulff seems to feel comfortable enough in his position to run a fairly moderate , non-confrontational campaign . instead , most of the attention has been focused on hesse , were incumbent premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who came to power in 1999 on a platform against the liberalization of immigration laws , has been running a highly controversial campaign .
fearing that he might lose his majority in the state parliament , koch has unleashed a debate on youth crime , calling for harsher punishments and demanding that criminal immigrants be deported . he 's also warned voters that a victory of his challenger , social democrat andrea ypsilanti , might lead to a left-wing coalition , including the greens and the left party , a relative newcomer on the german political scene , which was formed in a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists . koch 's strategy , however , does not seem to have paid off : his original lead in the polls has shrunk and ypsilanti has a real chance of replacing him as state leader . should this happen , it would also send a strong signal to berlin , where christian and social democrats are sharing power in a grand coalition .
the two state elections are being seen as a dry run for the federal elections which must be held by september 2009 . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse would give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to roll back reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . click on the links below to find out more about the controversies surrounding the hesse state election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- dw-world.de german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are divided on expelling a prominent member of their party after he warned voters about the risks of voting for the spd in a key upcoming poll , adding fuel to a highly charged campaign .

25 , told journalists in vienna that they had agreed to set up a new party in order to defend europe from numerous challenges that it faces today .
" we say : patriots of all the countries of europe , unite , " freedom party leader heinz-christian strache said at the news conference , also attended by french right-winger jean-marie le pen , among others .
" because only together will we solve our problems . "
warning about the dangers that immigration and " islamization " pose for europe , the right-wing leaders said that that the new party would be based on european christian traditions across the continent - including non-eu members such as serbia and russia - and that it would fight against the eu 's centralized bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volen siderov leads bulgaria 's nationalist party attaca " it 's important to have a federation of honest europeans in europe , " said bulgarian right-winger volen siderov .
" we are for a federal europe made up of fatherlands working together … we do n't want a centralist federalized states . "
the leaders declined to name any other parties the new movement was negotiating with , but ruled out talks with german right-wing extremists npd and vdu .
the plans for a pan-european nationalist party draw a stinging rebuke from austria 's social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- who called it " completely absurd and contradictory . "
" the project of european integration is aimed at a peaceful cooperation of eu states and , without any doubt , against nationalist efforts " said elisabeth grossman , spö 's spokesperson for european affairs .

"
in order to launch a party on the european level that would receive benefits from the 27-member block , the right-wing caucus still needs to get the support of parties from three additional eu countries .
the group , however , hopes to extend their membership beyond the bare minimum and surpass the 20-seat threshold necessary to be recognized by the european parliament .
" our goal is clear , we want more than 10 parties as members and ideally one party from each eu country , " starche said .

the bloc was dissolved on nov .
14 after romanian deputies quit the group in response to racially insulting comments by an italian politician .
asked about the chances of success of the new party , le pen said " it 's not necessary to hope in order to try , nor to succeed in order to persevere . "
the new grouping does not want to see turkey become a member of the european union and vehemently opposes the efforts of the predominantly muslim kosovo albanians to secede from serbia .

25 , told journalists in vienna that they had agreed to set up a new party in order to defend europe from numerous challenges that it faces today .
" we say : patriots of all the countries of europe , unite , " freedom party leader heinz-christian strache said at the news conference , also attended by french right-winger jean-marie le pen , among others .
" because only together will we solve our problems . "
warning about the dangers that immigration and " islamization " pose for europe , the right-wing leaders said that that the new party would be based on european christian traditions across the continent - including non-eu members such as serbia and russia - and that it would fight against the eu 's centralized bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volen siderov leads bulgaria 's nationalist party attaca " it 's important to have a federation of honest europeans in europe , " said bulgarian right-winger volen siderov .
" we are for a federal europe made up of fatherlands working together … we do n't want a centralist federalized states . "
the leaders declined to name any other parties the new movement was negotiating with , but ruled out talks with german right-wing extremists npd and vdu .
the plans for a pan-european nationalist party draw a stinging rebuke from austria 's social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- who called it " completely absurd and contradictory . "
" the project of european integration is aimed at a peaceful cooperation of eu states and , without any doubt , against nationalist efforts " said elisabeth grossman , spö 's spokesperson for european affairs .

"
in order to launch a party on the european level that would receive benefits from the 27-member block , the right-wing caucus still needs to get the support of parties from three additional eu countries .
the group , however , hopes to extend their membership beyond the bare minimum and surpass the 20-seat threshold necessary to be recognized by the european parliament .
" our goal is clear , we want more than 10 parties as members and ideally one party from each eu country , " starche said .

14 after romanian deputies quit the group in response to racially insulting comments by an italian politician .
asked about the chances of success of the new party , le pen said " it 's not necessary to hope in order to try , nor to succeed in order to persevere . "
the new grouping does not want to see turkey become a member of the european union and vehemently opposes the efforts of the predominantly muslim kosovo albanians to secede from serbia .
the party is expected to be officially launched by november 2008 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unlike the great majority of uk banks , northern rock relied upon borrowing funds from the wholesale money markets to fund its mortgage business , rather than the usual method of using savers ' deposits .
yet when the credit crunch hit , northern rock suddenly found it could not secure the cheap funds it needed , as credit was either unavailable or markedly more expensive .
as the first emergency loan from the bank of england was announced , thousands of northern rock savers rushed to withdraw their funds , before the government 's pledge to guarantee all savings .

the report also said the uk 's tripartite financial authorities - the fsa , the treasury and the bank of england - were insufficiently prepared to deal with northern rock 's difficulties and needed to communicate better with each other .
it wants to see the creation of a head of financial security at the bank of england , who will act as a key adviser to the chancellor .
report calls for new head of financial stability at the bank of england industry fund to protect deposits at failing bank special regime to take over running of any crisis-hit bank the report also calls for the establishment of a deposit protection fund , funded by the uk 's commercial banks .

" it 's probably one of the most damning reports that any select committee has put out in recent times , " he added .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable said northern rock 's managers " behaved like a bunch of cowboys " .
" and the fsa did nothing to rein them in , or even appear to see there was a problem . "
the government is continuing efforts to find a private buyer for northern rock .
it has proposed turning the £ 25bn of loans from the bank of england into government bonds , which will then be sold on to investors .

a year after a near- £ 1m project was awarded to digitise modern welsh writing , a dispute between authors and the library has not been resolved .
the library is putting some 3.5m words from 20th century english and welsh periodicals and magazines on the web .
but literature promotion agency academi wants writers to be paid a share .
academi chief executive peter finch said : " it 's an extremely exciting programme : what 's wrong with it is there is no small sliver in there for paying the writers . "
the big issue that is going to face writers everywhere is that certain corporations want to digitise works that are in copyright without paying the authors " former national poet gwyneth lewis " everybody else in the whole process is getting paid but the writers do n't .
" we know that in the arts sector , lottery money is shrinking down to go to the olympics .
a lot of people will be without money . "
the library aims to gain permission to digitise the contents of 90 journals , published since 1900 , from the publishers .
some 600,000 pages of welsh literary works , including poetry , translations and reviews , will be put online .
the library has said an offer to take down from its live site material by writers who object is a " reasonable compromise " .
wales ' former national poet , gwyneth lewis said the issue was a matter of principle .
she said : " this is the thin end of the wedge .
the big issue that is going to face writers everywhere is that certain corporations want to digitise works that are in copyright without paying the authors .
" if a writer 's work is going to be put on a different platform , rights need to be negotiated with the writer for that extension , and that has n't happened , therefore they ca n't have the work . "
" the national library of wales 's generous offer to digitalise a selection of welsh periodicals is a substantial boost to our cultural heritage " writer lewis davies however , some writers are happy for their works to be digitised without a payment .
writer and publisher lewis davies , whose 1993 book work , sex and rugby was voted the best book to describe wales in the world book day campaign in 2003 , is in favour .
in a comment on academi 's website , he said : " i feel that the national library of wales 's generous offer to digitalise a selection of welsh periodicals is a substantial boost to our cultural heritage and they should be congratulated for securing funding in a competitive world for this project .
" as a writer i 've already been paid for my work published in the magazines which are due to be digitalised and the fact that the work which would otherwise be largely lost , unread and scattered is now to be universally available at the national library of wales is a significant extra payment in itself . "
in an open letter to academi , national library librarian andrew green said : " since the scope of the project runs back to 1900 , much of this research is essentially a historical exercise ; the majority of authors involved are dead .
" our experience has been that 99 % of copyright holders are happy to grant consent ; the proportion of copyright holders who have not been contacted and would refuse is therefore very small . "
the library has been asked to comment .
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said : " we understand that the national library of wales and academi have been in discussion on this matter and that these discussions continue . "

the royal society for the protection of birds 's annual big garden birdwatch aims to find out which species are the most common visitors to uk 's gardens .
in 2007 , some 400,000 people took part in the survey and counted six million birds in 236,000 gardens .
the rspb says the goldfinch is likely to make it into the top 10 of species spotted in gardens and parks .
during the past 30 years goldfinch numbers have increased by half in the survey .
gemma rogers from the rspb told the bbc the bird was benefiting from warmer temperatures .
" goldfinches usually would go to southern europe for the winter but they just have n't really needed to as much this year , so we 're expecting that more will be around the uk in january than usual . "
the rspb expects people to see fewer blue tits because they are laying their eggs earlier and because of the wetter weather .
important habitat rspb birdwatch record sheet " the caterpillars will have been washed off the leaves and their food generally will have been harder for them to find , " said ms rogers .
while chaffinches and great tit numbers have grown in the past three decades , other birds such as the starling and the once-common sparrow have seen a serious drop in the average seen per garden .
since the event began in 1979 , the number of starlings counted has fallen by 76 % .
the number of house sparrows counted has also fallen by 52 % .
according to the rspb , gardens are a vitally important habitat for wildlife , and many garden birds are doing well because people provide them with safe havens with food , water and shelter .
the scheme originally began as an activity for children who were members of the young ornithologists club .
participants are asked to submit their results online and the results will be published in march 2008 .
the rspb will use the information to record patterns in bird numbers and prioritise conservation efforts .

the royal society for the protection of birds 's annual big garden birdwatch aims to find out which species are the most common visitors to uk 's gardens .
in 2007 , some 400,000 people took part in the survey and counted six million birds in 236,000 gardens .
the rspb says the goldfinch is likely to make it into the top 10 of species spotted in gardens and parks .
during the past 30 years goldfinch numbers have increased by half in the survey .
gemma rogers from the rspb told the bbc the bird was benefiting from warmer temperatures .
" goldfinches usually would go to southern europe for the winter but they just have n't really needed to as much this year , so we 're expecting that more will be around the uk in january than usual . "
the rspb expects people to see fewer blue tits because they are laying their eggs earlier and because of the wetter weather .

while chaffinches and great tit numbers have grown in the past three decades , other birds such as the starling and the once-common sparrow have seen a serious drop in the average seen per garden .
since the event began in 1979 , the number of starlings counted has fallen by 76 % .
the number of house sparrows counted has also fallen by 52 % .
according to the rspb , gardens are a vitally important habitat for wildlife , and many garden birds are doing well because people provide them with safe havens with food , water and shelter .

los angeles superior court judge tk herman granted an adjournment until 20 february , but told lawyers that no more delays would be allowed .
he said a trial would be forced within 30 days if both sides failed to agree how to proceed in the case .
the charge relates to an incident in august when spears hit a parked car .
the pop star faced hit-and-run charges after she left the scene , but they were dropped in october after she compensated the driver of the damaged vehicle .
plea deal spears ' lawyer michael flanagan said the singer was driving with a louisiana licence at the time of the incident and applied for a california licence one week after the charges were filed .
he added that a camera to take a photograph for the licence had not been available at the time .
mr flanagan said that spears had been offered a plea bargain deal which would have resulted in her being put on probation for one year .
but he said this was unnecessary because she had since obtained a valid california licence .
spears is currently embroiled in a custody battle over her two sons with ex-husband kevin federline , with the court recently making no changes to an order which denies her visitation rights .

it comes as trades unionists meet in glasgow to discuss the economic impact of not renewing the nuclear weapons system , based at faslane on the clyde .
the ministry of defence estimates that more than 11,000 jobs would be lost if trident was not replaced .
but the scottish trades union congress claims that is a gross exaggeration .
the uk government won commons support for plans to renew the uk 's nuclear submarine system last march .
between £ 15bn and £ 20bn would be spent on new submarines to carry the trident missiles .
fact file : trident missile the fleet would take 17 years to develop and build and would then last until about 2050 .
but an stuc and scottish campaign for nuclear disarmament joint report claims more jobs would be created in the scottish economy if the money was used for other purposes .
stephen boyd , assistant secretary of the stuc , said : " the funds currently earmarked to replace trident represent a huge opportunity for investment in the productive economy .
" with the necessary political will and a little imagination these resources could provide a massive boost to manufacturing industry in scotland , help to secure energy supplies and assist in the fight against climate change . "
the scottish government is also opposed to the renewal of the nuclear weapons system , a position backed by a vote in scottish parliament .

it comes as trades unionists meet in glasgow to discuss the economic impact of not renewing the nuclear weapons system , based at faslane on the clyde .
the ministry of defence estimates that more than 11,000 jobs would be lost if trident was not replaced .
but the scottish trades union congress claims that is a gross exaggeration .
the uk government won commons support for plans to renew the uk 's nuclear submarine system last march .
between £ 15bn and £ 20bn would be spent on new submarines to carry the trident missiles .
fact file : trident missile the fleet would take 17 years to develop and build and would then last until about 2050 .
but an stuc and scottish campaign for nuclear disarmament joint report claims more jobs would be created in the scottish economy if the money was used for other purposes .
stephen boyd , assistant secretary of the stuc , said : " the funds currently earmarked to replace trident represent a huge opportunity for investment in the productive economy .
" with the necessary political will and a little imagination these resources could provide a massive boost to manufacturing industry in scotland , help to secure energy supplies and assist in the fight against climate change . "
the scottish government is also opposed to the renewal of the nuclear weapons system , a position backed by a vote in scottish parliament .
