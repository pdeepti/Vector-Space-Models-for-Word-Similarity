17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " according to al-moallem , 1.5 million iraqi and 500,000 palestinian refugees live in syria .
in addition , around 250,000 people fled into the country during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict . " for these reason alone , syria has an enormous interest in peace in the region , " he added . germany courts syria as peace mediator steinmeier made a rare trip to damascus in december 2006 a month before berlin revived the so-called middle east quartet grouping the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations as germany assumed the eu presidency . on the topic of lebanon , al-moallem said syria would support ongoing efforts by the arab league to break the lebanese ’ s government ’ s presidential deadlock . lebanon has been without a head of state since emile lahoud stepped down nov .
23 with no elected successor because of a long-running dispute between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political impasse in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon ’ s parliament have continually failed to elect a new president in the past 15 months " we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said on tuesday .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . " lebanon 's parliament is due to meet on monday in a fresh attempt to choose a president amid deepening divisions between the western-backed ruling majority and the opposition , which is backed by syria and iran . the crisis has raised fears that the country might be heading towards a new civil war . the us and france have laid the blame for the continuing feud on syria , which effectively controlled its smaller neighbor for 29 years until its troops were forced to pull out in april 2005 after former prime minister rafik hariri was killed in a bomb attack . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " according to al-moallem , 1.5 million iraqi and 500,000 palestinian refugees live in syria .
in addition , around 250,000 people fled into the country during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict . " for these reason alone , syria has an enormous interest in peace in the region , " he added . germany courts syria as peace mediator steinmeier made a rare trip to damascus in december 2006 a month before berlin revived the so-called middle east quartet grouping the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations as germany assumed the eu presidency . on the topic of lebanon , al-moallem said syria would support ongoing efforts by the arab league to break the lebanese ’ s government ’ s presidential deadlock . lebanon has been without a head of state since emile lahoud stepped down nov .
23 with no elected successor because of a long-running dispute between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political impasse in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon ’ s parliament have continually failed to elect a new president in the past 15 months " we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said on tuesday .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . " lebanon 's parliament is due to meet on monday in a fresh attempt to choose a president amid deepening divisions between the western-backed ruling majority and the opposition , which is backed by syria and iran . the crisis has raised fears that the country might be heading towards a new civil war . the us and france have laid the blame for the continuing feud on syria , which effectively controlled its smaller neighbor for 29 years until its troops were forced to pull out in april 2005 after former prime minister rafik hariri was killed in a bomb attack . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " according to al-moallem , 1.5 million iraqi and 500,000 palestinian refugees live in syria .
in addition , around 250,000 people fled into the country during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict . " for these reason alone , syria has an enormous interest in peace in the region , " he added . germany courts syria as peace mediator steinmeier made a rare trip to damascus in december 2006 a month before berlin revived the so-called middle east quartet grouping the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations as germany assumed the eu presidency . on the topic of lebanon , al-moallem said syria would support ongoing efforts by the arab league to break the lebanese ’ s government ’ s presidential deadlock . lebanon has been without a head of state since emile lahoud stepped down nov .
23 with no elected successor because of a long-running dispute between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political impasse in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon ’ s parliament have continually failed to elect a new president in the past 15 months " we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said on tuesday .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . " lebanon 's parliament is due to meet on monday in a fresh attempt to choose a president amid deepening divisions between the western-backed ruling majority and the opposition , which is backed by syria and iran . the crisis has raised fears that the country might be heading towards a new civil war . the us and france have laid the blame for the continuing feud on syria , which effectively controlled its smaller neighbor for 29 years until its troops were forced to pull out in april 2005 after former prime minister rafik hariri was killed in a bomb attack . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " according to al-moallem , 1.5 million iraqi and 500,000 palestinian refugees live in syria .
in addition , around 250,000 people fled into the country during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict . " for these reason alone , syria has an enormous interest in peace in the region , " he added . germany courts syria as peace mediator steinmeier made a rare trip to damascus in december 2006 a month before berlin revived the so-called middle east quartet grouping the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations as germany assumed the eu presidency . on the topic of lebanon , al-moallem said syria would support ongoing efforts by the arab league to break the lebanese ’ s government ’ s presidential deadlock . lebanon has been without a head of state since emile lahoud stepped down nov .
23 with no elected successor because of a long-running dispute between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political impasse in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon ’ s parliament have continually failed to elect a new president in the past 15 months " we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said on tuesday .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . " lebanon 's parliament is due to meet on monday in a fresh attempt to choose a president amid deepening divisions between the western-backed ruling majority and the opposition , which is backed by syria and iran . the crisis has raised fears that the country might be heading towards a new civil war . the us and france have laid the blame for the continuing feud on syria , which effectively controlled its smaller neighbor for 29 years until its troops were forced to pull out in april 2005 after former prime minister rafik hariri was killed in a bomb attack . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de head of catholic church in germany to step down cardinal karl lehmann , the head of germany 's catholic church , has announced that he will vacate his post on feb .

22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .
arrest compounds concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting of the minds germany is watching the situation in iran closely , particularly after a man with dual iranian-german citizenship was arrested in berlin on suspicion of smuggling nuclear material to iran .
the 52-year-old businessman is accused of trying to send material to a company linked to iran 's nuclear program , according to the office of federal prosecutor monika harms .
customs officials raided the man 's home and office on tuesday .
according to the prosecuting authorities , he could face charges of smuggling prohibited material to a blacklisted company . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .

the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .

22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .

a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .
arrest compounds concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting of the minds germany is watching the situation in iran closely , particularly after a man with dual iranian-german citizenship was arrested in berlin on suspicion of smuggling nuclear material to iran .
the 52-year-old businessman is accused of trying to send material to a company linked to iran 's nuclear program , according to the office of federal prosecutor monika harms .
customs officials raided the man 's home and office on tuesday .
according to the prosecuting authorities , he could face charges of smuggling prohibited material to a blacklisted company . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority .

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we regret that in connection with this report , accusations and insinuations have been made against athletes . " german ski federation spokesman stefan schwarzbach said " the alleged doping affair " had now become " more or less a media affair . " he added that the federation would take legal steps against the journalists responsible but not against ard itself . the accusations have had a profound effect on the athletes , according to germany 's kati wilhelm , who won thursday 's women 's 7.5-kilometer sprint . " they were accusations which we all knew we had nothing to do with , " she said . last week , austrian prosecutors said they were investigating suspicions by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- that the private austrian laboratory humanplasma , a vienna-based blood bank , had been involved in illicit blood-doping activities . cyclists may have also been involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human plasma denies all knowledge of doping humanplasma 's management has denied any involvement in the alleged doping .
the medical director of the laboratory , lothar baumgartner , said he could not , however , rule out the possibility of laboratory premises being abused for off-hours illegal activities . austria 's own cross-country and biathlon teams were implicated in a blood doping scandal at the 2006 turin winter olympics that prompted six athletes being banned from all future olympic games . according to ard reports , professional cyclists , including austrian georg totschnig , dane micheal rasmussen , dutchman micheal boogerd and russian denis menchov , were also linked to the doping allegations involving humanplasma . on wednesday , rasmussen 's manager rejected allegations that the cyclist was involved in doping through the vienna-based blood bank . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 17.01.2008 privacy debate runs hot in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance in germany is increasing ten years ago , germany introduced a highly controversial eavesdropping law , which was later overturned by the courts .
a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases . " the federal government has already stated its intention of introducing spyware legislation , but has said it will await the court 's verdict before doing so . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases . " the federal government has already stated its intention of introducing spyware legislation , but has said it will await the court 's verdict before doing so . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .
criticism of eu plan riles barroso several nations have complained about the measures and targets included in the draft text , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the route to a clean eu would be tough the criticism forced european commission president jose manuel barroso onto the defensive .
" do not expect us to compromise on european interests , " he told members of the european parliament last week .
" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .
" it is essential to meet the three central challenges that the european union faces in energy : competitiveness , sustainability and security of supply .
" the commission is well aware of these realities , as our proposals will show , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .

analysts said the comments could mean that if kosovo declares unilateral independence , moscow could support independence for pro-russian separatists in georgia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 17.01.2008 privacy debate runs hot in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance in germany is increasing ten years ago , germany introduced a highly controversial eavesdropping law , which was later overturned by the courts .
a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases . " the federal government has already stated its intention of introducing spyware legislation , but has said it will await the court 's verdict before doing so . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .
when it attempted to widen its travels into germany , following the route the french victims of the holocaust would have taken , deutsche bahn denied it authorization .
latest installment of dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust survivor margot kleinberger visits the exhibit the train of commemoration foundation was then conceived by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics who took up the torch of the klarsfeld exhibit and created their own rolling exhibition , detailing how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transport ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project .
the train of commemoration has been touring germany since early november and is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 .

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .

it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .

sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .
criticism of eu plan riles barroso several nations have complained about the measures and targets included in the draft text , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the route to a clean eu would be tough the criticism forced european commission president jose manuel barroso onto the defensive .
" do not expect us to compromise on european interests , " he told members of the european parliament last week .
" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .
" it is essential to meet the three central challenges that the european union faces in energy : competitiveness , sustainability and security of supply .

" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .
arrest compounds concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting of the minds germany is watching the situation in iran closely , particularly after a man with dual iranian-german citizenship was arrested in berlin on suspicion of smuggling nuclear material to iran .
the 52-year-old businessman is accused of trying to send material to a company linked to iran 's nuclear program , according to the office of federal prosecutor monika harms .
customs officials raided the man 's home and office on tuesday .
according to the prosecuting authorities , he could face charges of smuggling prohibited material to a blacklisted company . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .

the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .

22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .

these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .

on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .

prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .
when it attempted to widen its travels into germany , following the route the french victims of the holocaust would have taken , deutsche bahn denied it authorization .
latest installment of dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust survivor margot kleinberger visits the exhibit the train of commemoration foundation was then conceived by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics who took up the torch of the klarsfeld exhibit and created their own rolling exhibition , detailing how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transport ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project .
the train of commemoration has been touring germany since early november and is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 .
so far 40,000 people have seen the exhibition , which is set to visit a total of 40 german cities before reaching auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 17.01.2008 privacy debate runs hot in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance in germany is increasing ten years ago , germany introduced a highly controversial eavesdropping law , which was later overturned by the courts .
a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases . " the federal government has already stated its intention of introducing spyware legislation , but has said it will await the court 's verdict before doing so . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .

the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .
when it attempted to widen its travels into germany , following the route the french victims of the holocaust would have taken , deutsche bahn denied it authorization .
latest installment of dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust survivor margot kleinberger visits the exhibit the train of commemoration foundation was then conceived by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics who took up the torch of the klarsfeld exhibit and created their own rolling exhibition , detailing how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transport ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project .
the train of commemoration has been touring germany since early november and is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we regret that in connection with this report , accusations and insinuations have been made against athletes . " german ski federation spokesman stefan schwarzbach said " the alleged doping affair " had now become " more or less a media affair . " he added that the federation would take legal steps against the journalists responsible but not against ard itself . the accusations have had a profound effect on the athletes , according to germany 's kati wilhelm , who won thursday 's women 's 7.5-kilometer sprint . " they were accusations which we all knew we had nothing to do with , " she said . last week , austrian prosecutors said they were investigating suspicions by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- that the private austrian laboratory humanplasma , a vienna-based blood bank , had been involved in illicit blood-doping activities . cyclists may have also been involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human plasma denies all knowledge of doping humanplasma 's management has denied any involvement in the alleged doping .
the medical director of the laboratory , lothar baumgartner , said he could not , however , rule out the possibility of laboratory premises being abused for off-hours illegal activities . austria 's own cross-country and biathlon teams were implicated in a blood doping scandal at the 2006 turin winter olympics that prompted six athletes being banned from all future olympic games . according to ard reports , professional cyclists , including austrian georg totschnig , dane micheal rasmussen , dutchman micheal boogerd and russian denis menchov , were also linked to the doping allegations involving humanplasma . on wednesday , rasmussen 's manager rejected allegations that the cyclist was involved in doping through the vienna-based blood bank . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.01.2008 germany urges broadening iran sanctions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions continue to worry the west germany wants a show of solidarity for other world leaders when dealing with iran and will push for tougher sanctions at a meeting next week . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is expected to push the five permanent members of the united nations security council to take a tougher stand on iran when the countries meet in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .
arrest compounds concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting of the minds germany is watching the situation in iran closely , particularly after a man with dual iranian-german citizenship was arrested in berlin on suspicion of smuggling nuclear material to iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.01.2008 germany urges broadening iran sanctions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions continue to worry the west germany wants a show of solidarity for other world leaders when dealing with iran and will push for tougher sanctions at a meeting next week . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is expected to push the five permanent members of the united nations security council to take a tougher stand on iran when the countries meet in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .
arrest compounds concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting of the minds germany is watching the situation in iran closely , particularly after a man with dual iranian-german citizenship was arrested in berlin on suspicion of smuggling nuclear material to iran .
the 52-year-old businessman is accused of trying to send material to a company linked to iran 's nuclear program , according to the office of federal prosecutor monika harms .
customs officials raided the man 's home and office on tuesday .
according to the prosecuting authorities , he could face charges of smuggling prohibited material to a blacklisted company . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de iran : we 're willing to cooperate in nuclear crisis iranian officials rang in a new phase of cooperation after talks on friday with the head of the un nuclear watchdog agency .
the latter said that tehran had to move swiftly to show its good will .

" we regret that in connection with this report , accusations and insinuations have been made against athletes . " german ski federation spokesman stefan schwarzbach said " the alleged doping affair " had now become " more or less a media affair . " he added that the federation would take legal steps against the journalists responsible but not against ard itself . the accusations have had a profound effect on the athletes , according to germany 's kati wilhelm , who won thursday 's women 's 7.5-kilometer sprint . " they were accusations which we all knew we had nothing to do with , " she said . last week , austrian prosecutors said they were investigating suspicions by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- that the private austrian laboratory humanplasma , a vienna-based blood bank , had been involved in illicit blood-doping activities . cyclists may have also been involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human plasma denies all knowledge of doping humanplasma 's management has denied any involvement in the alleged doping .
the medical director of the laboratory , lothar baumgartner , said he could not , however , rule out the possibility of laboratory premises being abused for off-hours illegal activities . austria 's own cross-country and biathlon teams were implicated in a blood doping scandal at the 2006 turin winter olympics that prompted six athletes being banned from all future olympic games . according to ard reports , professional cyclists , including austrian georg totschnig , dane micheal rasmussen , dutchman micheal boogerd and russian denis menchov , were also linked to the doping allegations involving humanplasma . on wednesday , rasmussen 's manager rejected allegations that the cyclist was involved in doping through the vienna-based blood bank . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .
when it attempted to widen its travels into germany , following the route the french victims of the holocaust would have taken , deutsche bahn denied it authorization .
latest installment of dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust survivor margot kleinberger visits the exhibit the train of commemoration foundation was then conceived by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics who took up the torch of the klarsfeld exhibit and created their own rolling exhibition , detailing how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transport ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project .
the train of commemoration has been touring germany since early november and is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 .
so far 40,000 people have seen the exhibition , which is set to visit a total of 40 german cities before reaching auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .
high-level diplomacy urged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council will consider sanctions steinmeier traveled to vienna , austria , for talks with the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- director mohamed elbaradei on thursday .
elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 17.01.2008 privacy debate runs hot in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance in germany is increasing ten years ago , germany introduced a highly controversial eavesdropping law , which was later overturned by the courts .
a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases . " the federal government has already stated its intention of introducing spyware legislation , but has said it will await the court 's verdict before doing so . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases .

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .

a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases .

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases .

a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy .

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .

it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .

" do not expect us to compromise on european interests , " he told members of the european parliament last week .
" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .

" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .

" we regret that in connection with this report , accusations and insinuations have been made against athletes . " german ski federation spokesman stefan schwarzbach said " the alleged doping affair " had now become " more or less a media affair . " he added that the federation would take legal steps against the journalists responsible but not against ard itself . the accusations have had a profound effect on the athletes , according to germany 's kati wilhelm , who won thursday 's women 's 7.5-kilometer sprint . " they were accusations which we all knew we had nothing to do with , " she said . last week , austrian prosecutors said they were investigating suspicions by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- that the private austrian laboratory humanplasma , a vienna-based blood bank , had been involved in illicit blood-doping activities . cyclists may have also been involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human plasma denies all knowledge of doping humanplasma 's management has denied any involvement in the alleged doping .
the medical director of the laboratory , lothar baumgartner , said he could not , however , rule out the possibility of laboratory premises being abused for off-hours illegal activities . austria 's own cross-country and biathlon teams were implicated in a blood doping scandal at the 2006 turin winter olympics that prompted six athletes being banned from all future olympic games . according to ard reports , professional cyclists , including austrian georg totschnig , dane micheal rasmussen , dutchman micheal boogerd and russian denis menchov , were also linked to the doping allegations involving humanplasma . on wednesday , rasmussen 's manager rejected allegations that the cyclist was involved in doping through the vienna-based blood bank . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " according to al-moallem , 1.5 million iraqi and 500,000 palestinian refugees live in syria .
in addition , around 250,000 people fled into the country during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict . " for these reason alone , syria has an enormous interest in peace in the region , " he added . germany courts syria as peace mediator steinmeier made a rare trip to damascus in december 2006 a month before berlin revived the so-called middle east quartet grouping the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations as germany assumed the eu presidency . on the topic of lebanon , al-moallem said syria would support ongoing efforts by the arab league to break the lebanese ’ s government ’ s presidential deadlock . lebanon has been without a head of state since emile lahoud stepped down nov .
23 with no elected successor because of a long-running dispute between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political impasse in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon ’ s parliament have continually failed to elect a new president in the past 15 months " we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said on tuesday .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . " lebanon 's parliament is due to meet on monday in a fresh attempt to choose a president amid deepening divisions between the western-backed ruling majority and the opposition , which is backed by syria and iran . the crisis has raised fears that the country might be heading towards a new civil war . the us and france have laid the blame for the continuing feud on syria , which effectively controlled its smaller neighbor for 29 years until its troops were forced to pull out in april 2005 after former prime minister rafik hariri was killed in a bomb attack . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .

the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .

the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 17.01.2008 privacy debate runs hot in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance in germany is increasing ten years ago , germany introduced a highly controversial eavesdropping law , which was later overturned by the courts .
a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .
authorities have defended the surveillance measures , saying they 're necessary to keep pace with terrorists and organized crime . " the internet has become the decisive medium , " august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of the foreign intelligence agency , told the constitutional court in karlsruhe at an october 2007 hearing into the legality of cyberspying in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorist attacks , " hanning said . in sept .
2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .
news reports said germany relied heavily on electronic intercepts provided to it by the cia to foil the plot .
because of germany 's own strict rules on police and security methods , police could not have gathered sufficient evidence to arrest the men without outside help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials hope to secretly install trojan spyware programs on suspects ' computers according to ulrich sieber , the director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law , cyberspying has the potential to be a " powerful instrument " in the fight against organized crime , but at the same time it is a " serious threat to privacy . " " consider the amount of data which you have on your computer - you have details about your health insurance , about your tax declarations , private letters and maybe your diaries , " sieber said . sieber added he believes the constitutional court will declare north rhine-westphalia 's state cyberspying legislation illegal because the provisions contained in the law were too broad . however , he said he expected the court 's judgment to very clearly state " in quite a restrictive way " how future legislation could provide for online surveillance in " limited cases . " the federal government has already stated its intention of introducing spyware legislation , but has said it will await the court 's verdict before doing so . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we regret that in connection with this report , accusations and insinuations have been made against athletes . " german ski federation spokesman stefan schwarzbach said " the alleged doping affair " had now become " more or less a media affair . " he added that the federation would take legal steps against the journalists responsible but not against ard itself . the accusations have had a profound effect on the athletes , according to germany 's kati wilhelm , who won thursday 's women 's 7.5-kilometer sprint . " they were accusations which we all knew we had nothing to do with , " she said . last week , austrian prosecutors said they were investigating suspicions by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- that the private austrian laboratory humanplasma , a vienna-based blood bank , had been involved in illicit blood-doping activities . cyclists may have also been involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human plasma denies all knowledge of doping humanplasma 's management has denied any involvement in the alleged doping .
the medical director of the laboratory , lothar baumgartner , said he could not , however , rule out the possibility of laboratory premises being abused for off-hours illegal activities . austria 's own cross-country and biathlon teams were implicated in a blood doping scandal at the 2006 turin winter olympics that prompted six athletes being banned from all future olympic games . according to ard reports , professional cyclists , including austrian georg totschnig , dane micheal rasmussen , dutchman micheal boogerd and russian denis menchov , were also linked to the doping allegations involving humanplasma . on wednesday , rasmussen 's manager rejected allegations that the cyclist was involved in doping through the vienna-based blood bank . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .

diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .

the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .

22 .
" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .

elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .
criticism of eu plan riles barroso several nations have complained about the measures and targets included in the draft text , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the route to a clean eu would be tough the criticism forced european commission president jose manuel barroso onto the defensive .
" do not expect us to compromise on european interests , " he told members of the european parliament last week .
" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .
" it is essential to meet the three central challenges that the european union faces in energy : competitiveness , sustainability and security of supply .
" the commission is well aware of these realities , as our proposals will show , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we regret that in connection with this report , accusations and insinuations have been made against athletes . " german ski federation spokesman stefan schwarzbach said " the alleged doping affair " had now become " more or less a media affair . " he added that the federation would take legal steps against the journalists responsible but not against ard itself . the accusations have had a profound effect on the athletes , according to germany 's kati wilhelm , who won thursday 's women 's 7.5-kilometer sprint . " they were accusations which we all knew we had nothing to do with , " she said . last week , austrian prosecutors said they were investigating suspicions by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- that the private austrian laboratory humanplasma , a vienna-based blood bank , had been involved in illicit blood-doping activities . cyclists may have also been involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human plasma denies all knowledge of doping humanplasma 's management has denied any involvement in the alleged doping .

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .
criticism of eu plan riles barroso several nations have complained about the measures and targets included in the draft text , which still requires approval by the european parliament and member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the route to a clean eu would be tough the criticism forced european commission president jose manuel barroso onto the defensive .
" do not expect us to compromise on european interests , " he told members of the european parliament last week .
" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .
" it is essential to meet the three central challenges that the european union faces in energy : competitiveness , sustainability and security of supply .
" the commission is well aware of these realities , as our proposals will show , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .

the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .
when it attempted to widen its travels into germany , following the route the french victims of the holocaust would have taken , deutsche bahn denied it authorization .
latest installment of dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust survivor margot kleinberger visits the exhibit the train of commemoration foundation was then conceived by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics who took up the torch of the klarsfeld exhibit and created their own rolling exhibition , detailing how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transport ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project .
the train of commemoration has been touring germany since early november and is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 .

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .
the draft version of the controversial climate package was revealed last week to some concern from a number of member states .
it includes measures to cut co2 levels " by at least 20 percent " and will demand stronger action from richer states .

" do not expect us to compromise on european interests , " he told members of the european parliament last week .
" both our international credibility and credibility before european union citizens depend on fulfillment of the targets .
" transforming to a low carbon community is not an easy task , but this is the moment to be serious and clear with our commitment , " barroso added .

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .

17 , steinmeier stressed that the most recent us-sponsored middle east peace conference was only a step in the right direction and should not itself be considered a success . " we reached the understanding in today 's talks in this critical , but open , phase , that it is necessary for all parties in the middle east to support the ongoing process , " steinmeier said in berlin . he added that " israelis and palestinians have to sense that negotiations will bring them concrete benefits : security on the one hand , a better livelihood on the other . " steinmeier also announced that palestinian prime minister salam fayyad is to visit germany wednesday to pursue business deals in europe .
steinmeier said the invitation to fayyad was part of german efforts to offer political and economic assistance to the palestinians as their humanitarian conditions worsen . " painful compromises " necessary at the mideast peace meeting held in november 2007 in the us city of annapolis , palestinian president mahmud abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert agreed to set the end of 2008 as a target date for a comprehensive middle east peace agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walid al-moallem was n't at the annapolis conference a syrian delegation took part in the conference despite long-standing animosity between washington and damascus . steinmeier also said on thursday he was aware all sides would have to make " painful compromises " to resolve the conflicts in the middle east but he said syria could count on european support if it helped remove key obstacles . " if syria makes visible , constructive efforts that lead to less tension in a region shaken and marked by crises and conflict , syrian-german ties and also syrian-european ties have potential that can be developed , " the german minister said . syria ready to help al-moallem , who also held talks with members of the german parliament , said a " comprehensive and just peace " between israelis and palestinians and an end to the dispute over the golan heights were damascus 's " top priority . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees wait outside the un headquarters in the syrian capital " it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " according to al-moallem , 1.5 million iraqi and 500,000 palestinian refugees live in syria .
in addition , around 250,000 people fled into the country during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict .

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : reform theologian hans kueng turns 80 " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " " the west has made many mistakes " " the pope must finally take some action " head of catholic church in germany to step down religion -pipe- 17.01.2008 theologian : new leader wo n't change german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta ranke-heinemann was ex-communicated in 1987 with cardinal karl lehmann resigning as head of the german bishops ' conference , are the winds of change blowing in the country 's catholic church ?
catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .

catholic theologian uta ranke-heinemann does n't seem to think so . uta ranke-heinemann was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of catholic theology , and the first woman in the world to lose it .
born in 1927 , the eldest daughter of former president gustav heinemann -lrb- 1969 - 74 -rrb- converted to catholicism in 1953 and studied in munich alongside joseph ratzinger , becoming a professor in 1970 .
in 1985 she began teaching at the university of essen -lrb- now known as the duisburg-essen university -rrb- but lost her position and was excommunicated in 1987 after she voiced doubts about the virgin birth .
she subsequently held a religious history chair at the university that was not controlled by the church .
in 1999 she was presidential candidate for the pds -lrb- party of democratic socialism -rrb- , but defeated by her nephew by marriage , johannes rau .
these days , she is a humanitarian activist and pacifist and writes books on catholicism , including the international bestsellers " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and " putting away childish things . "
dw-world.de talked to her about where germany 's catholic church is headed after cardinal karl lehmann announced this week that he would be stepping down as head of the german bishops ' conference . dw-world.de : cardinal karl lehmann is often referred to as the liberal voice of german catholicism .
is this a description you 'd agree with ? uta ranke-heinemann : cardinal lehmann is a tragic figure .
he and i were both students of karl rahner , the most influential theologian of the 20th century .
we were friends .
he took me home on occasion - only as far as the front door , of course , but nonetheless - and we agreed on everything .
these days , however , karl rahner is more or less dismissed by the bishops as a heretic .
you ca n't find his books anywhere .
but in 1984 , lehmann wrote an introduction to an anniversary publication marking rahners 's 80th birthday , in which he explicitly praised him and other theologians as forward-thinking and progressive on questions such as the virgin birth , brothers and sisters of jesus and the matter of joseph being the biological father of jesus , the son of god .
in 1987 he became head of the bishops ' conference , and this was the year i lost my professorship because i quoted rahner 's views on the virgin birth .
when i turned to lehmann for help , he failed to respond .
he clearly has one opinion for theology professors and another for the flock .
so while i consider lehmann likeable , i believe that he is a master of the double standard .
on a number of key issues , he has one truth for the pope and the simple-minded , and another for theology professors such as karl rahner . which ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann - a master of the double standard ?
the question of the virgin birth , use of condoms , abortion from the moment of conception .
personally i am against abortion , but not from the first moment of conception .
lehmann on the other hand called an embryo that 's just seconds old an individual , i.e. something indivisible , which is scientific nonsense .
other issues include the practice of exorcism under john paul ii and his successor benedict xvi , which lehmann happily goes along with .
" church exorcisms are necessary because otherwise , exorcisms will be performed outside the church and the situation will spiral out of control , " he said on spiegel tv in january 1996 .
now and then , lehmann tried in vain to find compromises with rome , which is why he is referred to as a liberal .
but under the current pope and his predecessor , he allowed the gap between the shepherd and his flock to become ever wider . lehmann has said he 'd like to see generational change in the catholic church here in germany .
do you think this will happen ? nonsense - they do n't want generational change at all .
all that matters is that they are all clones of the pope .
pope john paul ii only ever appointed clones and benedict does the same .
all the bishops are made in his image .
even the younger ones are no more modern or liberal .
characters such as joachim meisner -lsb- editor 's note : the archbishop of cologne -rsb- are all hand-picked .
they all go along with exorcism at christening for infants and " great " exorcism for adults -lrb- in keeping with john paul ii 's world catechism 1992 , no .
1237 , 1243 , 1673 -rrb- , and all they 're interested in is the abortion issue .
as part of the church 's worship of the virgin mary , it believes in the ensoulment of human life at the first moment .
prior to 1869 , it adhered to the principle of successive ensoulment and required excommunication for abortions only after 80 days .
rahner returned to the principle of successive ensoulment without attaching a particular time-frame to it .
today , the church pulls the wool over people 's eyes , and in essence it comes down to double standards and dishonesty .
and that 's my main reproach against lehmann . are there any liberal elements in the catholic church ? not among the bishops .
pope john paul ii put paid to the old guard - either their authority to teach was rescinded - such as hans küng -lsb- editors ' note : küng rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility and was stripped of his license to teach as a roman catholic theologian -rsb- - or they died , like karl rahner , and were replaced by new ones who were closely vetted .
one reason why the percentage of homosexuals in the vatican is so high is because all that matters is that none of the bishops have a record of relationships with women .
they must oppose birth control - and of course , women priests are unacceptable .
christianity has become reduced to a credo of celibacy . does it really matter who heads the german bishops conference , given that the final authority is always with the pope ? no !
that 's the point .
lehmann was seen as liberal because he would complain a little , he would take a humanitarian stance now and then and bleat a little .
he was never a fanatical hardliner like meisner .
but ultimately he always caved in .
he kept his mouth shut .
all that matters is the pope .
the bishops are utterly incapacitated . which reforms do you think the catholic church needs most ? the pope should not be infallible .
but i 'm pessimistic .
this will never happen .
nothing will change .
anyone who doubts the anti-abortion and anti-condom stance , for example , will simply never be allowed to become a bishop . why is the catholic church incapable of changing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fairytale figure ?
as an entity , the catholic church has taken 2000 years to achieve a theocratic concentration of power .
the pope does n't just want to rule the vatican , he wants to rule the world .
he wants god acknowledged in state constitutions , but of course only his god - after all , a donkey sees god as a donkey , man sees god as man .
but people seem to be able to accept this ridiculous fairytale figure of a pope .
so long as one does n't ask too many questions , it 's all very easy to believe . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a decade later , however , advocates argue people 's right to privacy is continuing to be eroded . the german " eavesdropping law " was passed by parliament on jan .
16 , 1998 , amid a huge public outcry over concerns that people 's private sphere was being invaded .
the law allowed authorities to secretly plant bugs and microphones inside people 's homes - a domain which was previously seen as inviolable under the country 's constitution . the then justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , even stepped down from her position after the fdp decided to support the bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eavesdropping law allowed the state to penetrate into people 's homes for the first time germany 's highest court later declared large sections of the law unconstitutional , in 2004 .
since then , however , the government has passed or proposed several new pieces of legislation which are seen as a further invasion of civil liberties . " if you take all the security measures used by authorities as a whole - such as telephone surveillance , internet surveillance , dragnet investigations , and the proposal to install spyware on computers , then the magnitude of state control of private citizens is quite apparent , " said frederik roggan , a lawyer and acting chairman of the humanist union , a civil-rights group . germany falls in privacy rankings although it still has a better privacy protection record than many other countries , in an annual ranking of 75 nations released by the london-based group privacy international , germany slipped from first place to seventh . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect at the beginning of 2008 , came in for particular criticism in the report , which was released earlier in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunication companies now have to face the issue of data storage the legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant . however , in the biggest mass lawsuit in the history of the constitutional court - germany 's highest court - some 30,000 citizens , privacy activists and civil rights groups filed a complaint against the telecommunications law at the beginning of the month . " the government has broken a taboo , " said roggan , who is one of the lawyers preparing the suit . " the main objection is ... that people who are n't even suspected of committing a crime and who are n't a danger are forced to have their entire telephone and online communications saved for a six month period , just in case they become a suspect in the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those wanting a new german passport now have to be fingerprinted privacy advocates have also criticized the requirement for electronic fingerprints to be included within all new german passports issued since november 2007 . by using the data , which also includes an electronic photograph , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together , theoretically making the document more secure . opponents of the measure argue the electronic information could be lifted from the chip and used by criminals intent on identity theft .
in addition , fingerprint files held at local registry offices while the passport is being processed - which can take up to six weeks - can be accessed by police . government pushes cyber-spying another major source of controversy is government proposals to smuggle spyware onto suspect 's computers in order to secretly keep track of internet use , e-mails , and other electronic data .

2007 , german police arrested three muslim men they say planned car bomb attacks around germany and belonged to a militant islamist group linked to al qaeda .

" we believe such a resolution is necessary , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said in announcing the meeting .
" iran should not get the impression that the international community lacks determination and solidarity , " jäger said .
a search for consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is pushing for a united stance yet world leaders continue to grapple with how to best confront iran , which has been accused of secretly trying to make an atomic bomb .
the best approach became even more muddled by a recent us intelligence report claiming iran stopped its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful .
yet the country has been dragging its feet on releasing information about past nuclear activities being done for military purposes .
iran had previously agreed to provide documentation by the end of 2007 .
iran 's failure to meet the deadline has increased calls for a third round of sanctions , this time against bank melli and bank saderat .
a previous sanction targeted iran 's bank sepah .
one diplomat said the berlin talks could bring broad agreements about what should be done with iran , but that there was no guarantee that parties could agree on specific actions .
china and russia are generally thought to be against further sanctions , particularly in light of the recent us intelligence estimate saying that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program .

elbaradei recently returned from a meeting with iranian leaders .
the iaea continues to investigate iran 's nuclear history and has been trying to get cooperation from tehran .
elbaradei called on iran to end the restrictions placed on un inspections which are carried out to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful .
iran has agreed to answer remaining questions about covert nuclear work with military aims , according to the iaea , which confirmed that steinmeier and the iaea chief would meet , but declined further comment .
diplomats told reuters that elbaradei could caution steinmeier against more sanctions .
sanctions could be a pretext for iran to delay answering outstanding questions .
iran has threatened to do just that .
after beginning to answer questions last fall , iran threatened that it would stop cooperating if broader sanctions were imposed .
elbaradei has called for diplomacy , saying that sanctions alone will not resolve the dispute .
the us wants an agreement on further sanctions , said us state department spokesman sean mccormack .
the meeting will be a chance to discuss sanctions , but will also look to the future , he said .
" so it 'll be both , talking about the here-and-now , the immediate , talking about the resolution , its contents , and then also talking about what happens after that , " mccormack said .

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .

the train of commemoration foundation had recently complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
the foundation argued that the bahn had to accept its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis and that included supporting the exhibition .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . "
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
government grant lets db off the hook but instead of deutsche bahn waving the fee , the germany 's transport ministry has intervened .
it offered a grant of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- to the foundation and called for corporate sponsorship for the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is accused of obstructing the exhibition while the grant and any corporate sponsorship that follows may help to alleviate the financial costs for the foundation , the organizers of the exhibit feel deutsche bahn is getting off the hook , courtesy of its federal paymasters .
they see the row over rail-track fees as just another example of deutsche bahn 's indifference to the project since its conception .
the group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations .
when it attempted to widen its travels into germany , following the route the french victims of the holocaust would have taken , deutsche bahn denied it authorization .

now germany is concerned that the promises of other nations were just hot air . germany is holding firm on its ambitious promise to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 , the country 's environment minister said thursday , jan .
17 , but warned that other industrial nations and the european union were lagging behind in their commitment to targets set at the international climate conference in bali last year .
sigmar gabriel issued a declaration on behalf of the german government that reaffirmed germany 's commitment to slashing its co2 output in line with the bali discussions and demanded that others did the same .
gabriel told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , that " the world community has given the green light for a new climate agreement " which could be agreed upon by 2012 , the target set by those attending the bali conference .
however , he added , promises made by the attending officials , particularly from the eu , need to be reaffirmed and acted upon .
gabriel reasserts germany 's climate promise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has his doubts that the eu can reach its targets " germany stands firm in its national climate protection policy of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent , " gabriel said .
the european union needed to show that it was firm on its own target of 30 percent reduction , he said , adding that he doubted the eu 's ability to turn its promise into reality .
the eu promised in bali to lower its collective greenhouse gas output to at least 20 percent below that recorded in 1990 , and set its highest target at 30 percent .
the eu committee on climate change announced that it would issue a report next week detailing its plans for meeting its emissions cuts .

"
the last sparkle has finally worn off the fake gold chains nestled in thick chest hair . gone are the days - if they ever existed other than in 70s aftershave commercials - of the little woman fawning over her denim-clad man as he regales his mates with stories of sexual conquests , heavy drinking and brawls with other open-shirted neanderthals with chests so hairy they could have " please wipe your feet " stenciled on them . a survey , conducted for science magazine p.m. , revealed that as many as 89 percent of germans find macho men distasteful , while 61 percent of those harbor even stronger negative feelings towards the testosterone-charged beefcakes who swagger and strut their way through germany 's streets . the macho 's penchant for preening , bragging , overt sexuality and misogyny rate highly on the scale of attributes that turn people off .
the survey showed that showing-off received 81 percent in the hate-stakes , followed by 74 percent for arrogance , 65 percent for the macho 's treatment of women and 63 percent for male pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you look like a big girl in those pants " while there is no mention of souped-up cars , excessive jewelry and offensively tight clothing , many of those holding a grudge against the macho may well have felt the urge to write them in underneath the choices provided in pencil . however , not all people find the crowing and posturing of the macho to be annoying .
seven percent find these men to be desirable .
there 's no accounting for taste ... rate of annoyance increases with age the survey showed that the tolerance for machos also declines with age .
respondents over the age of 50 were the most against , saying that it was the arrogance of machos which most annoyed them .
a cranky 77 percent of 50-year-olds said that the macho attitude was the least acceptable attribute , compared to 64 percent of 14 to 29-year-olds who have a problem with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machos tend to grow out of it in later life - mostly german men , on the whole , also tend to distance themselves from the macho image as they get older whereas younger men actually seem to take pride in being a macho .
in all , 68 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 50 would not consider themselves to be macho .
only one percent of those over 50 would ever consider themselves to fit the profile . german women also have differing ideas as to how their men behave .
the survey showed that 14 percent of those who took the poll said they lived with a macho man while a fourth of all the women over 30 said that they co-habited with mr. 18th century sexual politics . the rest , presumably , had replaced their partners ' bedside reading material of playboy with an essay on gender equality . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- middle east tour diary bbc news / middle east graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:09 gmt , thursday , 17 january 2008 middle east tour diary george w bush has concluded a middle east tour which included his first visit as us president to israel and the palestinian territories , as well as stops in the gulf and egypt .
bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too !
i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
" it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension . "
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics " there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
" the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .

pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .

it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

bbc correspondent matthew price , who travelled with him , wrote a diary on his progress .
see a map of the president 's tour 16 january - 2230 gmt up the steps of air force one ...
i suppose the strangest thing about travelling on air force one is the knowledge that just a few metres in front of you on the same plane are some of the worlds most powerful people : bush , rice , hadley .
sitting just up in front .
or in the case of bush possibly lying in his bed , which is right up in the nose of the plane .
after our mad dash to the airport we rushed to the back of the plane where secret service men checked our passes off on a list and we went on board .
not where you walk on a commercial flight but much lower , similar to where the luggage goes .
up the stairs , probably 20 in all and then there 's a landing with the media area , the staff area and the secret service too .
inside - well , it 's grey .
pretty nasty actually .
and the media cabin is a bit like being in business seats with economy service .
first timers like me get a goody bag .
it used to have a box of cigarettes inside with the presidential seal on them , but nancy reagan , i 'm told , objected , so now you get white house seal m & ms. there 's no safety announcement .
i guess if you 're looking after the big man everyone else can fend for themselves .
and we did n't have to turn off mobiles - although there 's no signal at 33,000 feet !
there are 14 seats in the journo area and a couple of tvs .
bill clinton used to come back and chat .
the photographer next to me said it was bad .
you 'd be trying to sleep after a gruelling trip and he 'd be trying to banter .
no such problem with gw .
he stays well away from us .
the most interesting thing was how this is the real bubble .
the motorcade raced us to the tarmac then the plane then we taxied and flew and never once met a real person properly .
i know that 's modern politics , but i ca n't help thinking that george w bush had hardly been abroad when he was elected president and then for the last seven years he has been in a presidential bubble - he 's been subjected to this !
and he lives in washington , divorced as that place can be from real life too ! ... and settling down for the trip to washington dc i just realised while writing that i woke up this morning in riyadh , dropped in on sharm el-sheikh , and am now in washington dc .
and all day i think i 've had only one chat with a person from any of the three countries .
we landed a little early , around half-seven , and trotted out into a cold andrew 's air force base .
to the right marine one , the presidential helicopter .
and there , the man himself walking towards it .
he cuts a lonely figure , slightly hunched .
the chopper taxied then lifted off , at 7.48 .
back to the white house , the end of a visit that has seemed to be more about keeping up good relations , than real achievements .
me ?
i shared a taxi into town , to a funky little hotel .
it 's been an amazing trip .
i think i 'll sleep well tonight .
16 january - 1230 gmt now in the motorcade , but the old hands are nervous .
we 're too far back from the front of the motorcade .
finally into air force one !
and back to the us with the president .
more to follow the other end .
16 january - 1145 gmt not sure if i 've ever seen so many secret service people .
men in black glasses are everywhere here at the hotel where president bush and president mubarak hold their news conference in a few minutes .
the view from my seat .
spot the president !
the egyptians are big on security .
there have been several bomb attacks in sinai in recent years so along our route here were dozens of plain clothes agents sitting out in the desert by the road side .
so now a moment of quiet while we wait for the two leaders .
i 'm flying home on air force one , and the white house people are saying we have to run for the motorcade when it finishes .
there 's a frantic american woman who keeps telling us the president wo n't wait for us !
the photographers are telling us all to stay sitting so as not to obscure their view .
everyone 's a little on edge .
when they get here i 'll be a couple of metres away from arguably the world 's most powerful leader .
whatever your opinion of the man that 's pretty exciting .
or have i been in the bubble too long ? 16 january - morning one hour and twenty minutes of sleep .
in a week of hardly any rest .
the radio producer yolande got no sleep .
she was packing the equipment .
the press pack board their flight it 's 0630 .
the sun is just about to come up .
the sky is clear .
it is going to be one of those beautiful days you get so often in the middle east when the light makes everything appear so sharp , so well defined .
the cars are swerving across the lane in front of our bus .
but the traffic on the way to the airport is moving fast and we 'll be there soon .
off to egypt for a few hours .
then back to the usa .
i always feel the same when leaving the middle east .
slightly sad .
this is a special place , a place that has suffered so much , a place that is so misunderstood by so many people .
i wonder if george bush now feels he understands it a little better ? 15 january - afternoon i got out of " the bubble " today - for a whole 45 minutes .
i jumped in a taxi , and asked the driver to take me to a shopping street .
the driver , from bangladesh , laughed when i asked if he likes it here .
riyadh residents have little good to say about george bush " it 's not a good place , " he said .
he 's here , like all of the foreign workers , to earn money - in his case for family back home .
we pulled up and i got out .
in a stationary shop a man in the red and white chequered headscarf favoured by saudis said : " george bush ?
do n't like . "
in a cafe round the corner , bbc world tv was showing on the flat screen television , and at one table sat a man with a laptop watching youtube on wireless internet .
i asked about mr bush 's " freedom speech " in abu dhabi the other day .
" he always says this , this is his usual speech about freedom and democracy and things .
even in america they do n't have this , " he smiled .
" george bush is not a peaceful man .
he just , you know , starts a lot of wars . "
we drove back to the hotel .
i asked the bangladeshi taxi driver about the cost of fuel here .
" no , not expensive , " he said .
not sure that will make us consumers , nor george bush , feel any better about the cost of a barrel of oil ! 14 january - evening what a day .
everyone covering this visit says today they hit a brick wall .
i think the white house press people did too .
everyone looks exhausted .
the schedule is gruelling .
the heavy schedule is taking its toll on some journalists the story nose dived a bit so there was no adrenalin fuelling us all .
journalists like a bit of meat on the bones of the story , but today all we really found out about the president was that he was shown what he said were " beautiful birds " of prey .
then we got his dinner menu - artichoke soup , and apple pie with ice cream .
and you 'll be glad to know no doubt that the saudis held that dinner " relatively early for our early-to-bed president " according to his press secretary .
like i said , no news .
so the american journalists had to satisfy their networks with stories about how tomorrow we might witness the first snowfall in riyadh in decades .
" at least they wo n't have to go far to find sand for the roads " one correspondent reported .
14 january - midday " welcome to the middle ages , baby ! "
that 's what someone in the travelling white house press corps said as we hit the ground in saudi arabia .
women on board discussed whether they have to wear headscarves .
the gulf of understanding -lrb- or misunderstanding -rrb- is obvious .
on the bus to the hotel women were told that since we 're on a high-level visit they can choose whether or not to wear a headscarf .
bbc producer yolande knell dons headscarf to set up a sat phone since we 're in a very conservative muslim society where women are obliged to cover up , that seems strange official advice .
the bush family is friendly with the saudi royal family , so the president will know the limits of his so-called " freedom agenda " here .
a day after he called for countries across the middle east to be more democratic and liberal , to introduce economic and social reforms , this is as good a place as you get to see that 's not going to happen in any meaningful way during george w bush 's presidency .
he says each country must manage changes in its own way , but here to many it feels like he 's trying to impose western cultural values on the arab world .
there 's also a question over whether mr bush 's strategy to isolate iran because of its nuclear ambitions will work here .
the short answer is " no it wo n't " .
the saudis have always played a very clever balancing act to maintain regional stability .
they 've been worried recently about iran , but seem to have adopted an approach of trying to reach out to tehran to diffuse tension .
president bush will spend much of his two days in saudi arabia sightseeing rather than talking politics there 's an understanding among states in the region that tehran does n't react positively to aggression of either a political or military type .
in saudi arabia , and also the other states in this region , there 's a sense that iran 's nuclear ambitions have changed the rules of the game .
when once the saudis , like the egyptians , called for a nuclear-free middle east -lrb- remember israel is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads - although it never admits this -rrb- now they have shifted their position .
they say they want to develop their nuclear capability to diversify their energy resources , but the stated ambition is a clear response to iran .
as usual the saudis have to work hard to balance what 's good for their close ally the united states , and what their regional neighbours , including iran , need .
perhaps that 's why president bush will spend much of his time here in the next two days sightseeing rather than talking politics .
14 january - morning an early start today .
another early start !
we piled onto minibuses , with all our gear and drove the half hour or so to the airport .
air force one is a stunning sight on the tarmac to my left .
the sun rising behind it and lots of reporters getting their photos taken in front .
on board , we get offered a mimosa - one last drink before arriving in saudi arabia .
we 've just been reminded there 's no alcohol in saudi .
and the women travelling on the trip have been told to dress appropriately .
prepare for take off .
better go ! 13 january - evening it 's not just the bush white house i 'm learning about on this trip .
it 's also the american media machine .
the people who work alongside me in the radio reporting operation are all seasoned correspondents .
one is a household name in the us after years of service and renowned journalism .
matthew price 's despatches are " almost a book " by some us standards and yet they all spend most of the day filing the shortest of radio pieces .
so short indeed that they call them " spots " !
sometimes they get to do longer analysis , and their work is professional and of a high standard .
but it seems their stations no longer want more than a few seconds of coverage .
one of them , i 'll not say for which network , the other day lamented the stories being covered on the station 's website .
entertainment and wacky tales dominated .
then today , i was doing a recording to camera with an american tv crew .
i spoke for about a minute and a half to try to explain some of the background to the president 's speech .
that 's almost a book , the cameraman said when i finished .
he said in the us it 's just a lot shorter .
another day , another city - on sunday it was abu dhabi there is good journalism in the states , of course .
newspapers have quality stories and tv and radio deal with some weighty issues .
and i 'm travelling in the main with some excellent journalists who take their jobs seriously .
this is n't a criticism of them , but overall the coverage most of their companies provide is dominated by quick , catchy stories .
and it seems even their own president does n't get much of a look in .
some would argue the british media have already started down that path .
if that 's the case , the future does n't look to be a terribly well informed one .
enough !
to sleep , briefly .
tomorrow we 're off early to saudi arabia on the next leg of the trip .
day six .
country five .
13 january - morning they call it the bubble , and when we touched down in bahrain it felt like we were stuck right inside it .
the view from the bubble , through a rainy bus window the bus drove us out of the airport , it had parked next to the aeroplane and we simply walked onto it .
for some reason our convoy had a police escort , and we passed junctions where the local traffic had to wait for us as we drove through red lights .
we drove along the causeway towards the skyscrapers of manama .
other journalists took their cameras out , asking questions about what we were seeing .
excited tourists .
then we got to the hotel and were whisked in .
the reason they call it the bubble , is because this whole process means that from touchdown to media centre you literally look out of the bubble at the real world around you .
in kuwait i do n't think i met a single kuwaiti .
though to be fair most hotel staff there are from asia or elsewhere .
it 's basically like being embedded with the president - with all the issues that raises for journalists .
not that the white house in any way tries to affect our reporting .
breakfast in bahrain : president bush joins the troops for some food they have never approached me about a story i 've been filing .
i 've got total freedom , but because of the tight schedules do n't get to meet the people of the country we 're passing through .
that 's okay .
the job is to report on the president 's visit , but it does mean you need other sources of information about where you are .
one other quick thing .
mr bush while here in bahrain welcomed a new iraqi law that allows thousands of former junior supporters of saddam hussein 's baath party to take up government jobs .
it 's worth remembering that it was mr bush 's administration that supported the removal of baath party officials from office in the first place , soon after the occupation of iraq in 2003 .
the feeling in the region ?
among many i suspect " why did n't he follow the new line on former baath party officials in the first place ? "
right , got to pack .
we 're now off to abu dhabi .
12 january - 1200 gmt you ca n't miss george bush in a crowd .
that hand held high waving .
that swagger and grin .
i was quite surprised though when he walked through the arifjan military camp in kuwait at the reaction from the us soldiers and other personnel there .
they cheered of course , but i 'd thought they would have cheered for longer .
perhaps his unpopularity back home is rubbing off here ?
as he told the troops that the us would be victorious in iraq , condoleezza rice stood at the back , nodding in agreement behind her large black designer sunglasses .
mr bush has seemed more nuanced in his statements on this trip than he perhaps has in the past .
he also seems to have a firm grip of the issues as he sees them , and there 's a confidence about him .
it does n't mean he 's going to be successful of course .
many here argue his presidency has done too much damage in the middle east even to contemplate a bright future any time soon .
but as one american official told me , maybe , with us domestic attention focused on mr bush 's successor , perhaps he feels less constrained by us politics .
perhaps , as this official speculated , he 's enjoying simply the most powerful man in the world .
so .
now to bahrain .
we just boarded , after a mad rush of filing our stories .
the plane 's taxiing past air force one now .
another day , another country .
12 january - 0430 gmt early morning wake-up call again !
we 're all in the lobby of the crowne plaza hotel in kuwait with a load of our kit laid out on the floor and us security agents going through it .
we 're off to camp arifjan , the biggest us military base here .
the president 's going to speak to the troops and to his top general in iraq .
he 'll meet the us ambassador to iraq too .
today the agenda 's certainly less about israel and the palestinians .
11 january - evening amazing .
i just did something i never thought i would .
i got on a plane and flew from tel aviv to kuwait .
it took about two hours .
easy .
when i lived in jerusalem and travelled to iraq i would go through kuwait .
but the journey would take over seven hours - because there are no direct flights between the two countries .
until you 're travelling with the us president .
on friday , it only took two hours to reach kuwait from tel aviv the reason there are no direct flights is because kuwait like many arab countries does n't have normal relations with israel .
that 's something mr bush wants to address here .
he 's hoping to encourage allies of his , like kuwait , to have some contact at least with israel .
even before we 'd stepped off the plane condoleezza rice had said we should n't expect any developments on that , but she says there is progress .
and most arab states like kuwait will always find it an unreasonable demand to form any sort of tie with israel , as long as israel occupies palestinian land .
you can see how it 's all interlinked .
that 's why george bush 's strategy is - while not new - probably the only sensible way to proceed .
he 's worked out the issues that he thinks need addressing , and he 's trying to address all of them at the same time hoping progress on one will aid progress in others .
a virtuous circle if you like .
if it works maybe one day everyone will be able to fly from tel aviv to kuwait in two hours .
11 january - afternoon the travelling press pack is now off to kuwait , following hot on the heels of the president .
we are going to have to play catch-up on this leg as he will have done his official duties by the time we arrive .
george bush left israel talking of his confidence the ride out from jerusalem was beautiful .
it is a bright sunny day and now , travelling out of ben gurion airport is proving so easy .
i spent four years getting all sorts of lengthy personal security questions coming in and out of this airport .
this time , after a very brief delay our bus simply drove into the airport and right up to the plane .
we will be airborne within half an hour so .
the logistics that go into a trip like this are phenomenal .
it cost a huge amount of money - the white house is reluctant to say how much , but it is in the millions of dollars .
george bush clearly thinks it is worth it .
he left this troubled land still talking of his confidence .
now he has to get some of his arab allies on side to enlist their help in persuading the palestinians and the israelis to move forward .
10 january - evening the great thing about being involved in a trip like this is that you get a special press pass that so far seems to open all sorts of doors .
when the rest of the city is shut down , i just whip out my " white house middle east " card and sail through .
a cordial meeting between mr bush and mr abbas " the trip of the president to the middle east " it says on it .
note , not any old president , just the president !
and there is a confidence about the president and his people to be honest .
george bush admitted today in an aside that he can sometimes be criticised for not speaking english so well .
but on this trip so far he 's appeared literate , on top of the issues and actually rather believable about the whole prospect of middle east peace .
if i had n't worked here for almost four years before covering the us , i might even be a little less sceptical about his chances of success .
his national security adviser stephen hadley came and spoke to us today .
he said that the meeting with mahmoud abbas , the palestinian leader , had gone well , and that both sides had exchanged " reminiscences " during a working lunch .
he made it all sound very cordial .
and i spoke to another us official , who said he 'd been in a private meeting of the president and us staff working here in jerusalem .
the president - as he spoke about the chances of peace - had " welled up " he said .
visiting the holy land - as a religious man - has clearly affected george bush deeply .
9 january - evening poor old george bush .
he certainly picked a good day to be travelling to the middle east .
all eyes in america were on who might be the next us president , rather than him .
clinton and obama were names you heard far more frequently on the us networks on the first day of his trip here than you did the name bush .
mr bush 's visit has not been making a splash back home a friend of mine who works here for a big us network says they were seventh story in the running order and possibly not getting onto the main evening news .
and he was working with the white house correspondent !
what i thought was most interesting today was what felt like an ever so slightly more critical approach towards the israelis from the bush administration .
they are still the closest of allies of course .
however , in the last 24 hours i think every white house briefing we 've had has mentioned how israel has to stop settlement expansion , just as the palestinians have to stop attacks against israelis .
for years you rarely heard more than a cursory mention of israel 's settlement growth -lrb- remember one of israel 's commitments is to stop building jewish towns and villages on occupied palestinian land -rrb- .
it 'll be surprising if it makes a huge difference on the ground - but as president bush said with a smile to prime minister olmert today , " if you need a little nudge then you know i will give a nudge . "
he sounded like he meant it too .
9 january - morning the streets are quieter than i ever remember them , apart from when this country closes down on yom kippur .
people have stayed away from the city today , because the streets around the president 's hotel are closed .
there are police everywhere .
when the president 's convoy moves from venue to venue they simply shut down the route he takes to other traffic .
some of jerusalem 's principal thoroughfares are closed to traffic i walked up to the hotel , which is surrounded by israeli and us security people .
people hang around to take a quick photo and are told not to use their cameras .
there 's a strange feeling in the air .
i left a united states in the grip of early election fever where george w bush feels somewhat irrelevant .
here he 's greeted by all as the most powerful man on earth .
he hopes that will help encourage the israeli and palestinian leaders to focus on what he wants them to do - launch a proper negotiating process .
the thing that 's so noticeable is the difference between what you hear from bush 's aides , and what you hear from people on the streets here .
his aides tell us they 're still confident that there can be a negotiated peace deal by the end of the year .
and why not ?
after all most people understand the broad layout of what such a deal would look like .
in theory and on paper it is possible .
but then you talk to the people here , like my taxi driver this morning , who told me with that weary sigh everyone here has when talking about such visits : " it wo n't achieve anything . " 8 january midnight on a mild january night .
far warmer than the freezing conditions i left behind in iowa after reporting on the first stage of the process to chose the next president of the world 's most powerful nation .
the united states - caught up in the excitement of clinton v obama - almost seems to have almost forgotten that its current president has exactly a year left in office .
i wheel my case across the tarmac , towards the charter plane that 's taking reporters to the middle east on president bush 's eight-day trip , and chat to a colleague who covers the white house for another network .
" he 's got to go abroad , " we joke .
" no one here 's interested in him anymore ! "
but if george w bush - america 's least popular president in years -lrb- both at home and abroad -rrb- - gets it right , there will be more than just interest in him .
in pre-trip interviews he 's said he genuinely believes there can be a " comprehensive peace treaty -lsb- between israel and the palestinians -rsb- signed by the end of this year " .
having left jerusalem last august , after almost four years reporting from there , that strikes me as pretty unlikely .
as we taxi for take-off the steward makes a mistake during the safety announcement .
" in the event of a water execution ... " he trails off .
" do you mean water-boarding ? " shouts a journalist .
much laughter .
everyone here 's covered president bush 's refusal to say whether he considers - as many do - the interrogation technique to be torture .
we settle back for the ride .
in the next eight days we 'll visit six countries , one occupied territory , and a host of world leaders .
it 's going to be tiring , but fascinating .

health chiefs admit there is too little parking at the £ 15m community hospital , with workers needing 60 of 70 spaces .
a recent assessment showed the 30-bed ysbyty alltwen serving the porthmadog area of gwynedd needed 120 spots .
the north west wales nhs trust said it was looking into the issue and was hoping to increase bus services to the site .
in a report to a meeting of health watchdog meirionnydd community health council , its chief officer pat billingham said she was told at a recent meeting with trust officials that parking would be inadequate to cope with staff and visiting vehicles .
her report stated : " problems with parking have been highlighted .
the original plan was for 70 + , but staff will be utilising 60 + of these . "
" any delay in providing those spaces will naturally attract strong public criticism " councillor selwyn griffiths porthmadog councillor selwyn griffiths , who is also chair of gogledd gwynedd community health council , said he was surprised and disappointed the trust had not foreseen the need for 120 parking spaces before the plans were approved .
he said the hospital site was by a main road which , if clogged with cars unable to park in the hospital , could become congested .
he called on the trust and the contractors to pull out all the stops to ensure the parking issue was dealt with before the hospital is due to be completed in may .
" the plain fact is the trust is the owner of adequate land next to the hospital , and it should be simple enough to provide additional parking spaces , " he said .
" any delay in providing those spaces will naturally attract strong public criticism . "
bus services the trust said it was negotiating with bus companies to provide additional bus services to the site .
any further developments would be within the current boundaries of the hospital , added a spokesperson .
the parking problem follows building delays and technical problems at the hospital site which will replace the bron y garth hospital in penrhyndeudraeth .
ysbyty alltwen was originally scheduled to be completed in november 2007 with a march 2008 opening , but a trust spokesman said at the time they were aiming for a may handover with the hospital in use " later in the summer " .
its construction began in 2006 after a 15-year wait .

health chiefs admit there is too little parking at the £ 15m community hospital , with workers needing 60 of 70 spaces .
a recent assessment showed the 30-bed ysbyty alltwen serving the porthmadog area of gwynedd needed 120 spots .
the north west wales nhs trust said it was looking into the issue and was hoping to increase bus services to the site .
in a report to a meeting of health watchdog meirionnydd community health council , its chief officer pat billingham said she was told at a recent meeting with trust officials that parking would be inadequate to cope with staff and visiting vehicles .
her report stated : " problems with parking have been highlighted .
the original plan was for 70 + , but staff will be utilising 60 + of these . "
any delay in providing those spaces will naturally attract strong public criticism councillor selwyn griffiths porthmadog councillor selwyn griffiths , who is also chair of gogledd gwynedd community health council , said he was surprised and disappointed the trust had not foreseen the need for 120 parking spaces before the plans were approved .
he said the hospital site was by a main road which , if clogged with cars unable to park in the hospital , could become congested .
he called on the trust and the contractors to pull out all the stops to ensure the parking issue was dealt with before the hospital is due to be completed in may .
" the plain fact is the trust is the owner of adequate land next to the hospital , and it should be simple enough to provide additional parking spaces , " he said .
" any delay in providing those spaces will naturally attract strong public criticism . "
bus services the trust said it was negotiating with bus companies to provide additional bus services to the site .
any further developments would be within the current boundaries of the hospital , added a spokesperson .
the parking problem follows building delays and technical problems at the hospital site which will replace the bron y garth hospital in penrhyndeudraeth .
ysbyty alltwen was originally scheduled to be completed in november 2007 with a march 2008 opening , but a trust spokesman said at the time they were aiming for a may handover with the hospital in use " later in the summer " .
its construction began in 2006 after a 15-year wait .

the format remains 25 years after the original programme launched .
9 of 9 25 years on - breakfast presenters past and present broadcast a special birthday edition of the programme .

vera is part of a long line of indomitable , more mature women who endure for years and make a lasting impression .
here is a selection of soapland 's strong women who have gone on to become small screen legends .
pat evans - eastenders , 1986 to present pat wicks first appeared in albert square as a hard-nosed brass hell-bent on causing trouble with ex-husband pete beale -lrb- pauline fowler 's twin brother -rrb- .
as the years progressed she married teen sweetheart frank butcher and was the working mother at the centre of family life - which proved to be more dramatic and wayward than her trademark earrings .
she was unable to forget frank even after marrying fourth husband roy , embarking on a colourful affair which culminated in a public dressing-down by arch-rival and fellow grande dame peggy mitchell .
advancing years and widowhood made pat surrogate matriarch to the sprawling wicks clan - and will see another family gathering around her soon .
palmer makes eastenders return annie walker - coronation street , 1960-83 annie walker was coronation street 's first landlady of the rovers return pub , which she ran with husband jack until his death in 1970 , then solo for another 13 years .
while annie effortlessly henpecked jack , she became best known for her haughtiness and true belief that she was a cut above her working class customers in the back street weatherfield watering hole .
a stint as lady mayor did everything to reinforce her idea that she was a woman of substance .
annie was a pivotal figure in the early years of the street , later presiding over a classic line-up at the rovers which included bet lynch - the brassy barmaid who would later take on mrs walker 's mantle as landlady .
annie sugden - emmerdale , 1972-94 this once-dour tale of yorkshire farming folk began with the funeral of annie sugden 's husband - and from that moment on she was the head of the household and a pivotal figure during the soap 's early years .
for years annie seemed forever apron-clad and welded to her kitchen making cups of tea , but wielded power over sons joe and jack who were regularly at odds .
but as emmerdale was sexed up and the action shifted from the farm to the village , annie found she was displaced as the homely yet domineering matron .
she ended up in a coma and lost her second husband after a plane crashed on emmerdale in 1993 .
however , she recovered to enjoy retirement in spain with hirsute pub landlord amos brearly as the series swapped matriarchs for ruthless superbitches .
emmerdale 's path to soap success pauline fowler - eastenders , 1985-2006 when eastenders began , pauline fowler was truly overshadowed by mother lou beale , who lived in the family home and ruled over it with a rod of iron .
she was all about dowdy cardigans , shifts in the launderette and worries with husband arthur and daughter - gymslip mum michelle - until lou 's demise and the onset of age saw her transform into a matriarch .
pauline 's obsession became family , which was her undoing towards the end of her life when she became embroiled in a bitter dispute with son martin and his wife sonia .
she was driven to fake a fatal illness , accidentally set fire to the house , and on christmas day 2006 died alone in the snow of albert square .
wendy richard to leave eastenders meg mortimer - crossroads , 1964-81 meg mortimer - who started out life in the series as meg richardson - was the owner of the midlands motel , a shrewd-headed businesswoman with her son and daughter close at hand .
flame-haired , sophisticated meg became synonymous with the popular teatime soap , but actress noele gordon was eventually axed from the programme .
it led to one of crossroads ' most memorable moments , when the motel caught fire and it was feared that meg had perished in the blaze .
but she was waiting to sail off into the sunset on the qe2 for a new life .
some fans say matricarchal meg was the epitome of the programme , which went into a decline following her departure .
ena sharples - coronation street , 1960-80 sour-faced ena sharples with her hairnet and line in sharp patter is an enduring icon of coronation street from its earliest days almost half a century ago .
the derogratory term battleaxe can fairly be applied to ena , who famously sat in judgement in the snug of the rovers return with her cohorts and was at the heart of local gossip .
unlike matriarchs with a brood to rule over , ena 's plain talking left her alone and indulging in a long-running spat with street siren elsie tanner , while she never possessed a solid family home .
as actress violet carson sought retirement after 20 years in the role , ena went to stay with a friend and never returned to the cobbles of weatherfield .

some top distributors , anxious to maintain a roster of films should the strike drag on , are arriving in park city , utah in an acquisitive mood .
hollywood 's stockpile remains considerable , but buyers will be on the prowl looking for independent pictures with commercial potential .
it has become a sellers ' market , which is good news for film-makers en route to the festival angling for distribution deals .
there are no precise figures , but it is estimated that some 50,000 festival-goers will be heading for this utah ski resort .
selling out among them are major stars , film-makers , journalists , publicists and assorted others who will play out their assigned roles .
sundance is routinely accused of selling out to mainstream hollywood interests .
but the 11-day extravaganza , founded by robert redford , is still viewed as the world 's premiere showcase for independent cinema .
in bruges - a picture with both a british and irish pedigree - is the high-profile opening night park city film .
it stars ralph fiennes , colin farrell and brendan gleeson and is the first full-length feature from irish playwright martin mcdonagh .
farrell and gleeson play eccentric hitmen ordered to visit the belgian city while awaiting instructions from their malevolent boss , played by fiennes .
it is being sold as farrell 's film , and the irish actor does deliver quite nicely with his portrayal of a violent and vulnerable hit man in this absurd twisted dark comedy .
but it is fiennes who gives a truly memorable performance as a rage-filled british gangster with no mercy when it comes to terminating human life .
other big names with films at the festival include sean penn , bruce willis , robert de niro , steve coogan , bill murray , kirsten dunst , anjelica huston and jack black .
british talent at sundance includes sir ben kingsley , who plays a psychiatrist with a liking for marijuana in the wackness , and director james marsh , who is promoting his film man on wire .
controversial subjects many of the works being shown at sundance remain a mystery .
of the 125 features being presented , 51 come from relatively unknown film-makers who have never been to sundance .
it is not easy to identify a trend among this year 's crop of films .
but many of the pictures look at social issues through personal experiences .
by contrast , some of last year 's films were more objective attempts to address controversial subjects , including the war in iraq . "
whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring " the big question remains how many of this year 's sundance offerings will see the light of day beyond park city .
in the past some big hits have emerged , most spectacularly the oscar-winning hit little miss sunshine , which premiered at the festival in 2006 .
last year 's festival yielded few films that maintained a profile beyond sundance or made a stack of money .
john cusack 's war-themed grace is gone won sundance prizes and a distribution deal at the festival , but netted a miserable sum at the us box office .
sundance veterans complain relentlessly that the festival is not what it used to be , saying it is hard to negotiate a sprawling event which often suffers from the cold and heavy traffic .
many purists also resent the presence of businesses who have absolutely nothing to do with independent cinema and come to town to cash in on the proceedings .
but whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring .
among the offerings , there are without fail some wondrous films - even though they may have no commercial viability .
there is also a palpable camaraderie among sundance attendees .
it represents a coming-together for indie film-makers who are geographically dispersed and often work in isolation .
the festival will provide a protective bubble for the film industry as the uncertainty of the writers ' strike continues .

some top distributors , anxious to maintain a roster of films should the strike drag on , are arriving in park city , utah in an acquisitive mood .
hollywood 's stockpile remains considerable , but buyers will be on the prowl looking for independent pictures with commercial potential .
it has become a sellers ' market , which is good news for film-makers en route to the festival angling for distribution deals .
there are no precise figures , but it is estimated that some 50,000 festival-goers will be heading for this utah ski resort .
selling out among them are major stars , film-makers , journalists , publicists and assorted others who will play out their assigned roles .
sundance is routinely accused of selling out to mainstream hollywood interests .
but the 11-day extravaganza , founded by robert redford , is still viewed as the world 's premiere showcase for independent cinema .
in bruges - a picture with both a british and irish pedigree - is the high-profile opening night park city film .
robert redford is the founder of the ' alternative ' festival it stars ralph fiennes , colin farrell and brendan gleeson and is the first full-length feature from irish playwright martin mcdonagh .
farrell and gleeson play eccentric hitmen ordered to visit the belgian city while awaiting instructions from their malevolent boss , played by fiennes .
it is being sold as farrell 's film , and the irish actor does deliver quite nicely with his portrayal of a violent and vulnerable hit man in this absurd twisted dark comedy .
but it is fiennes who gives a truly memorable performance as a rage-filled british gangster with no mercy when it comes to terminating human life .
other big names with films at the festival include sean penn , bruce willis , robert de niro , steve coogan , bill murray , kirsten dunst , anjelica huston and jack black .
british talent at sundance includes sir ben kingsley , who plays a psychiatrist with a liking for marijuana in the wackness , and director james marsh , who is promoting his film man on wire .
controversial subjects many of the works being shown at sundance remain a mystery .
of the 125 features being presented , 51 come from relatively unknown film-makers who have never been to sundance .
it is not easy to identify a trend among this year 's crop of films .
but many of the pictures look at social issues through personal experiences .
by contrast , some of last year 's films were more objective attempts to address controversial subjects , including the war in iraq .
whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring the big question remains how many of this year 's sundance offerings will see the light of day beyond park city .
in the past some big hits have emerged , most spectacularly the oscar-winning hit little miss sunshine , which premiered at the festival in 2006 .
last year 's festival yielded few films that maintained a profile beyond sundance or made a stack of money .
john cusack 's war-themed grace is gone won sundance prizes and a distribution deal at the festival , but netted a miserable sum at the us box office .

vera is part of a long line of indomitable , more mature women who endure for years and make a lasting impression .
here is a selection of soapland 's strong women who have gone on to become small screen legends .
pat evans - eastenders , 1986 to present pat wicks first appeared in albert square as a hard-nosed brass hell-bent on causing trouble with ex-husband pete beale -lrb- pauline fowler 's twin brother -rrb- .
frank butcher was the love of pat 's life as the years progressed she married teen sweetheart frank butcher and was the working mother at the centre of family life - which proved to be more dramatic and wayward than her trademark earrings .
she was unable to forget frank even after marrying fourth husband roy , embarking on a colourful affair which culminated in a public dressing-down by arch-rival and fellow grande dame peggy mitchell .
advancing years and widowhood made pat surrogate matriarch to the sprawling wicks clan - and will see another family gathering around her soon .
palmer makes eastenders return annie walker - coronation street , 1960-83 annie walker was coronation street 's first landlady of the rovers return pub , which she ran with husband jack until his death in 1970 , then solo for another 13 years .
annie walker was known for looking down her nose at hilda ogden while annie effortlessly henpecked jack , she became best known for her haughtiness and true belief that she was a cut above her working class customers in the back street weatherfield watering hole .
a stint as lady mayor did everything to reinforce her idea that she was a woman of substance .
annie was a pivotal figure in the early years of the street , later presiding over a classic line-up at the rovers which included bet lynch - the brassy barmaid who would later take on mrs walker 's mantle as landlady .
annie sugden - emmerdale , 1972-94 this once-dour tale of yorkshire farming folk began with the funeral of annie sugden 's husband - and from that moment on she was the head of the household and a pivotal figure during the soap 's early years .
annie sugden rarely seemed to leave the kitchen for years annie seemed forever apron-clad and welded to her kitchen making cups of tea , but wielded power over sons joe and jack who were regularly at odds .
but as emmerdale was sexed up and the action shifted from the farm to the village , annie found she was displaced as the homely yet domineering matron .
she ended up in a coma and lost her second husband after a plane crashed on emmerdale in 1993 .
however , she recovered to enjoy retirement in spain with hirsute pub landlord amos brearly as the series swapped matriarchs for ruthless superbitches .
emmerdale 's path to soap success pauline fowler - eastenders , 1985-2006 pauline fowler was at the centre of family feuds towards her life 's end when eastenders began , pauline fowler was truly overshadowed by mother lou beale , who lived in the family home and ruled over it with a rod of iron .
she was all about dowdy cardigans , shifts in the launderette and worries with husband arthur and daughter - gymslip mum michelle - until lou 's demise and the onset of age saw her transform into a matriarch .
pauline 's obsession became family , which was her undoing towards the end of her life when she became embroiled in a bitter dispute with son martin and his wife sonia .
she was driven to fake a fatal illness , accidentally set fire to the house , and on christmas day 2006 died alone in the snow of albert square .
wendy richard to leave eastenders meg mortimer - crossroads , 1964-81 actress noele gordon died in 1985 meg mortimer - who started out life in the series as meg richardson - was the owner of the midlands motel , a shrewd-headed businesswoman with her son and daughter close at hand .
flame-haired , sophisticated meg became synonymous with the popular teatime soap , but actress noele gordon was eventually axed from the programme .
it led to one of crossroads ' most memorable moments , when the motel caught fire and it was feared that meg had perished in the blaze .
but she was waiting to sail off into the sunset on the qe2 for a new life .
some fans say matricarchal meg was the epitome of the programme , which went into a decline following her departure .
ena sharples - coronation street , 1960-80 sour-faced ena sharples with her hairnet and line in sharp patter is an enduring icon of coronation street from its earliest days almost half a century ago .
ena sharples was not renowned for cracking a smile the derogratory term battleaxe can fairly be applied to ena , who famously sat in judgement in the snug of the rovers return with her cohorts and was at the heart of local gossip .
unlike matriarchs with a brood to rule over , ena 's plain talking left her alone and indulging in a long-running spat with street siren elsie tanner , while she never possessed a solid family home .
as actress violet carson sought retirement after 20 years in the role , ena went to stay with a friend and never returned to the cobbles of weatherfield .

vera is part of a long line of indomitable , more mature women who endure for years and make a lasting impression .
here is a selection of soapland 's strong women who have gone on to become small screen legends .
pat evans - eastenders , 1986 to present pat wicks first appeared in albert square as a hard-nosed brass hell-bent on causing trouble with ex-husband pete beale -lrb- pauline fowler 's twin brother -rrb- .
frank butcher was the love of pat 's life as the years progressed she married teen sweetheart frank butcher and was the working mother at the centre of family life - which proved to be more dramatic and wayward than her trademark earrings .
she was unable to forget frank even after marrying fourth husband roy , embarking on a colourful affair which culminated in a public dressing-down by arch-rival and fellow grande dame peggy mitchell .
advancing years and widowhood made pat surrogate matriarch to the sprawling wicks clan - and will see another family gathering around her soon .
palmer makes eastenders return annie walker - coronation street , 1960-83 annie walker was coronation street 's first landlady of the rovers return pub , which she ran with husband jack until his death in 1970 , then solo for another 13 years .
annie walker was known for looking down her nose at hilda ogden while annie effortlessly henpecked jack , she became best known for her haughtiness and true belief that she was a cut above her working class customers in the back street weatherfield watering hole .
a stint as lady mayor did everything to reinforce her idea that she was a woman of substance .
annie was a pivotal figure in the early years of the street , later presiding over a classic line-up at the rovers which included bet lynch - the brassy barmaid who would later take on mrs walker 's mantle as landlady .
annie sugden - emmerdale , 1972-94 this once-dour tale of yorkshire farming folk began with the funeral of annie sugden 's husband - and from that moment on she was the head of the household and a pivotal figure during the soap 's early years .
annie sugden rarely seemed to leave the kitchen for years annie seemed forever apron-clad and welded to her kitchen making cups of tea , but wielded power over sons joe and jack who were regularly at odds .
but as emmerdale was sexed up and the action shifted from the farm to the village , annie found she was displaced as the homely yet domineering matron .
she ended up in a coma and lost her second husband after a plane crashed on emmerdale in 1993 .

some top distributors , anxious to maintain a roster of films should the strike drag on , are arriving in park city , utah in an acquisitive mood .
hollywood 's stockpile remains considerable , but buyers will be on the prowl looking for independent pictures with commercial potential .
it has become a sellers ' market , which is good news for film-makers en route to the festival angling for distribution deals .
there are no precise figures , but it is estimated that some 50,000 festival-goers will be heading for this utah ski resort .
selling out among them are major stars , film-makers , journalists , publicists and assorted others who will play out their assigned roles .
sundance is routinely accused of selling out to mainstream hollywood interests .
but the 11-day extravaganza , founded by robert redford , is still viewed as the world 's premiere showcase for independent cinema .
in bruges - a picture with both a british and irish pedigree - is the high-profile opening night park city film .
robert redford is the founder of the ' alternative ' festival it stars ralph fiennes , colin farrell and brendan gleeson and is the first full-length feature from irish playwright martin mcdonagh .
farrell and gleeson play eccentric hitmen ordered to visit the belgian city while awaiting instructions from their malevolent boss , played by fiennes .
it is being sold as farrell 's film , and the irish actor does deliver quite nicely with his portrayal of a violent and vulnerable hit man in this absurd twisted dark comedy .
but it is fiennes who gives a truly memorable performance as a rage-filled british gangster with no mercy when it comes to terminating human life .
other big names with films at the festival include sean penn , bruce willis , robert de niro , steve coogan , bill murray , kirsten dunst , anjelica huston and jack black .
british talent at sundance includes sir ben kingsley , who plays a psychiatrist with a liking for marijuana in the wackness , and director james marsh , who is promoting his film man on wire .
controversial subjects many of the works being shown at sundance remain a mystery .
of the 125 features being presented , 51 come from relatively unknown film-makers who have never been to sundance .
it is not easy to identify a trend among this year 's crop of films .
but many of the pictures look at social issues through personal experiences .
by contrast , some of last year 's films were more objective attempts to address controversial subjects , including the war in iraq .
whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring the big question remains how many of this year 's sundance offerings will see the light of day beyond park city .
in the past some big hits have emerged , most spectacularly the oscar-winning hit little miss sunshine , which premiered at the festival in 2006 .
last year 's festival yielded few films that maintained a profile beyond sundance or made a stack of money .
john cusack 's war-themed grace is gone won sundance prizes and a distribution deal at the festival , but netted a miserable sum at the us box office .
sundance veterans complain relentlessly that the festival is not what it used to be , saying it is hard to negotiate a sprawling event which often suffers from the cold and heavy traffic .
oscar winner little miss sunshine was first aired at sundance many purists also resent the presence of businesses who have absolutely nothing to do with independent cinema and come to town to cash in on the proceedings .
but whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring .
among the offerings , there are without fail some wondrous films - even though they may have no commercial viability .
there is also a palpable camaraderie among sundance attendees .
it represents a coming-together for indie film-makers who are geographically dispersed and often work in isolation .
the festival will provide a protective bubble for the film industry as the uncertainty of the writers ' strike continues .

some top distributors , anxious to maintain a roster of films should the strike drag on , are arriving in park city , utah in an acquisitive mood .
hollywood 's stockpile remains considerable , but buyers will be on the prowl looking for independent pictures with commercial potential .
it has become a sellers ' market , which is good news for film-makers en route to the festival angling for distribution deals .
there are no precise figures , but it is estimated that some 50,000 festival-goers will be heading for this utah ski resort .
selling out among them are major stars , film-makers , journalists , publicists and assorted others who will play out their assigned roles .
sundance is routinely accused of selling out to mainstream hollywood interests .
but the 11-day extravaganza , founded by robert redford , is still viewed as the world 's premiere showcase for independent cinema .
in bruges - a picture with both a british and irish pedigree - is the high-profile opening night park city film .
robert redford is the founder of the ' alternative ' festival it stars ralph fiennes , colin farrell and brendan gleeson and is the first full-length feature from irish playwright martin mcdonagh .
farrell and gleeson play eccentric hitmen ordered to visit the belgian city while awaiting instructions from their malevolent boss , played by fiennes .
it is being sold as farrell 's film , and the irish actor does deliver quite nicely with his portrayal of a violent and vulnerable hit man in this absurd twisted dark comedy .
but it is fiennes who gives a truly memorable performance as a rage-filled british gangster with no mercy when it comes to terminating human life .
other big names with films at the festival include sean penn , bruce willis , robert de niro , steve coogan , bill murray , kirsten dunst , anjelica huston and jack black .
british talent at sundance includes sir ben kingsley , who plays a psychiatrist with a liking for marijuana in the wackness , and director james marsh , who is promoting his film man on wire .
controversial subjects many of the works being shown at sundance remain a mystery .
of the 125 features being presented , 51 come from relatively unknown film-makers who have never been to sundance .
it is not easy to identify a trend among this year 's crop of films .
but many of the pictures look at social issues through personal experiences .
by contrast , some of last year 's films were more objective attempts to address controversial subjects , including the war in iraq .
whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring the big question remains how many of this year 's sundance offerings will see the light of day beyond park city .
in the past some big hits have emerged , most spectacularly the oscar-winning hit little miss sunshine , which premiered at the festival in 2006 .
last year 's festival yielded few films that maintained a profile beyond sundance or made a stack of money .
john cusack 's war-themed grace is gone won sundance prizes and a distribution deal at the festival , but netted a miserable sum at the us box office .
sundance veterans complain relentlessly that the festival is not what it used to be , saying it is hard to negotiate a sprawling event which often suffers from the cold and heavy traffic .
oscar winner little miss sunshine was first aired at sundance many purists also resent the presence of businesses who have absolutely nothing to do with independent cinema and come to town to cash in on the proceedings .
but whatever the frustrations , sundance can be truly inspiring .
among the offerings , there are without fail some wondrous films - even though they may have no commercial viability .
there is also a palpable camaraderie among sundance attendees .
it represents a coming-together for indie film-makers who are geographically dispersed and often work in isolation .
the festival will provide a protective bubble for the film industry as the uncertainty of the writers ' strike continues .

millions of people were short of water , and dozens of ships had run aground in the river since october , reports said .
officials said low water levels in the yangtze were not linked to construction of the massive three gorges dam .
china faces droughts and floods annually but has seen a recent increase in extreme weather conditions .
in the major yangtze port city of hankou , water levels fell to 13.98m -lrb- 46ft -rrb- in early january - the lowest level since records began in 1866 , china daily said , citing local media .
" this year 's drought is rare , " the daily quoted a local farmer as saying .
" just days ago , i saw ship after ship running aground .
i have never seen that before . "
supporters say the dam will prevent flooding and generate electricity water levels in other rivers and reservoirs in china are also reported to be at record lows .
officials said that an earlier than expected dry season was to blame for the drought .
authorities have already warned that climate change could make weather conditions in china much tougher in the years ahead .
large amounts of water were also stored behind the three gorges dam last month , causing a 50 % reduction in the flow volume of the yangtze , china daily said .
but the yangtze river water resource commission said this was not the cause of the problem , the daily added .
supporters of the dam say it will prevent devastating floods and provide much-needed hydroelectric power but there are concerns over its environmental impact .
