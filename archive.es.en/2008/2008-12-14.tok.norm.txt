they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is an ambassador for the campaign police prefer to concentrate on driving home the message that getting drunk is " uncool , " and have persuaded leading sports personalities to act as ambassadors in the stay gold campaign .
among them are the beijing olympics modern pentathlon champion lena schoeneborn , 22 , and footballer vedad ibisevic , the bundesliga 's leading goal-scorer this season .
" you 've got your own personality and are strong enough , " is their message .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .

other demands include retrospective supplementary payments and the scrapping of a new timetable that includes branch line closures . meanwhile , four hours of talks between unions and senior management of the german-owned airport operator budapest airport , with participation by ceo jost lammers , failed to break the deadlock on sunday . the frustrated management of budapest airport subsequently issued a statement with a direct message to the strikers . " the extended work stoppage jeopardizes not only your own jobs , but also those of the airline and ground staff that work alongside you , " the statement said . gasko met union leaders at budapest airport in the afternoon for talks on " how to combine the airport and railway strikes with a view to increasing the pressure . " hungary is bracing itself for yet more industrial action in the near future .

the marches of discontent were organized by opposition politicians and critics who formed a new political party to challenge the kremlin . police spokesman viktor biryukov told the interfax news agency that 90 arrests were made in moscow for participating in an illegal demonstration .
a self-proclaimed march of the dissidents in st. petersburg led to about 60 arrests . about 500 people gathered at the two demonstrations to protest the government 's reactions to the financial crisis and ongoing attempts to change the russian constitution .
eyewitnesses reported that special omon police units used violence to disperse the protesters . ahead of the arrests , a spokesman for the moscow police told the interfax news agency that authorities would be " tough but lawful " in dealing with the unsanctioned protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups have little support among the russian public witnesses said that police trucks sealed off two squares in central moscow , where the other russia coalition of opposition groups wanted to start its march .
police cordons prevented a handful of opposition supporters from entering the squares , reuters news agency reported . " they are saving their money , " sergei gulyayev , a senior member of other russia coalition , told a rally in st. petersburg .
" they will not save the russian economy .
with this government , this president and this prime minister we are heading to a collapse .

hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .

that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

14 .
the marches of discontent were organized by opposition politicians and critics who formed a new political party to challenge the kremlin . police spokesman viktor biryukov told the interfax news agency that 90 arrests were made in moscow for participating in an illegal demonstration .
a self-proclaimed march of the dissidents in st. petersburg led to about 60 arrests . about 500 people gathered at the two demonstrations to protest the government 's reactions to the financial crisis and ongoing attempts to change the russian constitution .
eyewitnesses reported that special omon police units used violence to disperse the protesters . ahead of the arrests , a spokesman for the moscow police told the interfax news agency that authorities would be " tough but lawful " in dealing with the unsanctioned protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups have little support among the russian public witnesses said that police trucks sealed off two squares in central moscow , where the other russia coalition of opposition groups wanted to start its march .
police cordons prevented a handful of opposition supporters from entering the squares , reuters news agency reported . " they are saving their money , " sergei gulyayev , a senior member of other russia coalition , told a rally in st. petersburg .
" they will not save the russian economy .
with this government , this president and this prime minister we are heading to a collapse . " despite the media attention they receive , opposition groups enjoy little support among the broader russian public , particularly as the country 's economy has improved over the last eight years . one day after opposition party founded the detentions came a day after russian opposition politicians and kremlin critics garry kasparov and boris nemtsov founded a new political party named solidarity . according to the internet site kasparov.ru on sunday , among those arrested by police was writer eduard limonov , head of outlawed national-bolshevik party .
according to media reports , omon units also arrested about 50 former officers who sought to join the opposition protests . " we are only trying to exercise our constitutional rights to demonstrate peacefully , " kasparov said . saturday 's announcement of the new solidarity political party was seen as an effort by the traditionally splintered russian opposition to try to unite against what it sees as an increasingly authoritarian kremlin . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , after civil unrest triggered by the shooting of a teenage boy by police . violence reignited in athens for an eighth day , with protestors firebombing a police station just moments after a peaceful vigil held in honor of a teenage boy killed in a police shooting . the latest unrest followed a candlelit vigil in front of parliament marking a week since 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos was shot dead by police on dec .
6 in the exarchia district of central athens . police used tear gas late saturday on some 100 hooded youths who firebombed the station near athen 's exarchia district where grigoropoulos was shot . earlier saturday evening , youths rampaged in the northern city of thessaloniki , vandalizing a gymnasium and causing extensive damage to businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots this week were the worst greece has seen in decades the riots have been greece 's worst in decades , destroying hundreds of shops , banks , buildings and cars in more than eight cities including the capital athens and the port cities of thessaloniki and patras . gangs of youths and self-styled anarchists have been smashing windows , looting shops and setting up flaming barricades in streets across the country . underlying discontent though the violence is tied to the shooting of grigoropoulos , students have also been protesting economic and education reforms .
unemployment rates are particularly high among the 15 to 24-year-old age group and economic malaise is strong . the protests have united both mainstream and radical youths and the opposition socialists have seized the opportunity to press for fresh elections . saturday 's violence came after greek prime minister costas karamanlis had dismissed calls to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests in greece were violent " at this time the country faces a serious financial crisis … a steady hand on the helm is needed to deal with it , " he said from an eu summit in brussels . peaceful contrast in contrast to the week of violence , thousands gathered in peaceful demonstrations saturday across greece , with hundreds of candles illuminating in a peaceful sit-down demonstration in synatagma square outside the greek parliament . the city center appeared to return to normal , with shops open and cafes filled with customers . city workers even began decorating the main syntagma square for the upcoming holidays , after a massive tree and christmas village were damaged and torched by rioters . the police officer who shot grigoropoulos has said the boy was killed by accident when the bullet ricocheted and hit him .

the marches of discontent were organized by opposition politicians and critics who formed a new political party to challenge the kremlin . police spokesman viktor biryukov told the interfax news agency that 90 arrests were made in moscow for participating in an illegal demonstration .
a self-proclaimed march of the dissidents in st. petersburg led to about 60 arrests . about 500 people gathered at the two demonstrations to protest the government 's reactions to the financial crisis and ongoing attempts to change the russian constitution .
eyewitnesses reported that special omon police units used violence to disperse the protesters . ahead of the arrests , a spokesman for the moscow police told the interfax news agency that authorities would be " tough but lawful " in dealing with the unsanctioned protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups have little support among the russian public witnesses said that police trucks sealed off two squares in central moscow , where the other russia coalition of opposition groups wanted to start its march .
police cordons prevented a handful of opposition supporters from entering the squares , reuters news agency reported . " they are saving their money , " sergei gulyayev , a senior member of other russia coalition , told a rally in st. petersburg .
" they will not save the russian economy .
with this government , this president and this prime minister we are heading to a collapse . " despite the media attention they receive , opposition groups enjoy little support among the broader russian public , particularly as the country 's economy has improved over the last eight years . one day after opposition party founded the detentions came a day after russian opposition politicians and kremlin critics garry kasparov and boris nemtsov founded a new political party named solidarity . according to the internet site kasparov.ru on sunday , among those arrested by police was writer eduard limonov , head of outlawed national-bolshevik party .
according to media reports , omon units also arrested about 50 former officers who sought to join the opposition protests . " we are only trying to exercise our constitutional rights to demonstrate peacefully , " kasparov said . saturday 's announcement of the new solidarity political party was seen as an effort by the traditionally splintered russian opposition to try to unite against what it sees as an increasingly authoritarian kremlin . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is an ambassador for the campaign police prefer to concentrate on driving home the message that getting drunk is " uncool , " and have persuaded leading sports personalities to act as ambassadors in the stay gold campaign .
among them are the beijing olympics modern pentathlon champion lena schoeneborn , 22 , and footballer vedad ibisevic , the bundesliga 's leading goal-scorer this season .

the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .

bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.12.2008 germans turn to graphic images to combat drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 20,000 germans are hospitalized for alcohol poisoning each year a new police-initiated campaign in germany tries to give young people a dose of reality by showing what drinking too much could do to them . graphic scenes of young people in drunken incidents form the backbone of a campaign launched in germany to raise awareness of the negative consequences of heavy drinking .
they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is an ambassador for the campaign police prefer to concentrate on driving home the message that getting drunk is " uncool , " and have persuaded leading sports personalities to act as ambassadors in the stay gold campaign .
among them are the beijing olympics modern pentathlon champion lena schoeneborn , 22 , and footballer vedad ibisevic , the bundesliga 's leading goal-scorer this season .

loew subsequently ordered ballack to apologize .
as a result , ballack remained on the team and its captain . in addition , forward kevin kuranyi walked out of the team after being cut from the roster and watching a match from the stands . loew said the public discussions had not had a positive effect on the germany team and lessons had to be learned . " we have seen that you have to constantly remind several players of certain rules .
it 's a never-ending process , " he said .
" but everything has been openly discussed . " loew said the priority now was to qualify for 2010 world cup in south africa . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the marches of discontent were organized by opposition politicians and critics who formed a new political party to challenge the kremlin . police spokesman viktor biryukov told the interfax news agency that 90 arrests were made in moscow for participating in an illegal demonstration .
a self-proclaimed march of the dissidents in st. petersburg led to about 60 arrests . about 500 people gathered at the two demonstrations to protest the government 's reactions to the financial crisis and ongoing attempts to change the russian constitution .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loew subsequently ordered ballack to apologize .
as a result , ballack remained on the team and its captain . in addition , forward kevin kuranyi walked out of the team after being cut from the roster and watching a match from the stands . loew said the public discussions had not had a positive effect on the germany team and lessons had to be learned . " we have seen that you have to constantly remind several players of certain rules .
it 's a never-ending process , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.12.2008 germans turn to graphic images to combat drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 20,000 germans are hospitalized for alcohol poisoning each year a new police-initiated campaign in germany tries to give young people a dose of reality by showing what drinking too much could do to them . graphic scenes of young people in drunken incidents form the backbone of a campaign launched in germany to raise awareness of the negative consequences of heavy drinking .
they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is an ambassador for the campaign police prefer to concentrate on driving home the message that getting drunk is " uncool , " and have persuaded leading sports personalities to act as ambassadors in the stay gold campaign .
among them are the beijing olympics modern pentathlon champion lena schoeneborn , 22 , and footballer vedad ibisevic , the bundesliga 's leading goal-scorer this season .
" you 've got your own personality and are strong enough , " is their message .

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .

is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is an ambassador for the campaign police prefer to concentrate on driving home the message that getting drunk is " uncool , " and have persuaded leading sports personalities to act as ambassadors in the stay gold campaign .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .

it 's a never-ending process , " he said .

14 .
travel disruption continued at budapest 's ferihegy international airport as ongoing industrial action by airport employees went into its fifth day . hundreds of hungarian railway workers stopped work at midnight as saturday turned to sunday .
imre kavalecz , spokesman for the state mav railway company said around half the trains in the main eastern cities of debrecen and miskolc were affected , while in other areas , 90 percent of trains were running . the industrial action was initially confined to the eastern half of hungary .
however , the head of the vszdsz , istvan gasko , announced in the morning that from 6 p.m. local time on sunday , the strike will be extended to cover the whole country . the main rail union , vdszsz , is demanding a one-off payment of 250,000 forint -lrb- 930 euros , $ 1,263 -rrb- to every worker as a share in the proceeds from the recent privatization of mav cargo , the spun-off freight division of mav .
other demands include retrospective supplementary payments and the scrapping of a new timetable that includes branch line closures . meanwhile , four hours of talks between unions and senior management of the german-owned airport operator budapest airport , with participation by ceo jost lammers , failed to break the deadlock on sunday . the frustrated management of budapest airport subsequently issued a statement with a direct message to the strikers . " the extended work stoppage jeopardizes not only your own jobs , but also those of the airline and ground staff that work alongside you , " the statement said . gasko met union leaders at budapest airport in the afternoon for talks on " how to combine the airport and railway strikes with a view to increasing the pressure . " hungary is bracing itself for yet more industrial action in the near future .
public sector workers last week announced a nationwide strike on jan .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loew subsequently ordered ballack to apologize .
as a result , ballack remained on the team and its captain . in addition , forward kevin kuranyi walked out of the team after being cut from the roster and watching a match from the stands . loew said the public discussions had not had a positive effect on the germany team and lessons had to be learned . " we have seen that you have to constantly remind several players of certain rules .
it 's a never-ending process , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social change -pipe- 14.12.2008 europe does n't have sole claim to the enlightenment , says poet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says islamic civilization was at its peak well before european greats came along the west should keep in mind that islamic civilization reached its peak long before europe 's enlightenment , says german poet hans magnus enzensberger , adding that isolation is a death sentence for every culture . deutsche welle : in dubai , we are witnessing the realization of a gigantic modernization project - albeit without the adoption of " western values " such as democracy and the rule of law .
can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .
one beer mat photo shows a partially clothed young girl slouched on a park bench between empty bottles of sparkling wine .
is it only a hangover she has , or was she raped while in a drunken stupor ?
bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is an ambassador for the campaign police prefer to concentrate on driving home the message that getting drunk is " uncool , " and have persuaded leading sports personalities to act as ambassadors in the stay gold campaign .
among them are the beijing olympics modern pentathlon champion lena schoeneborn , 22 , and footballer vedad ibisevic , the bundesliga 's leading goal-scorer this season .

loew subsequently ordered ballack to apologize .
as a result , ballack remained on the team and its captain . in addition , forward kevin kuranyi walked out of the team after being cut from the roster and watching a match from the stands . loew said the public discussions had not had a positive effect on the germany team and lessons had to be learned . " we have seen that you have to constantly remind several players of certain rules .
it 's a never-ending process , " he said .
" but everything has been openly discussed . " loew said the priority now was to qualify for 2010 world cup in south africa . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

" ongoing talks to be held over the coming weeks would include " great concentration on a concerted approach , " to getting through the current crisis , she said , adding that germany as a " strong country " that could withstand the ongoing economic turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans leaders are hoping to get a glimpse of what 2009 could bring " it 's about reaching a common evaluation of the perspectives for 2009 with social , business and banking partners , " merkel told the paper of the meeting on sunday , dec .

" i am entirely convinced that we , the germans , are going to overcome this challenge .

in the interview with german newsweekly der spiegel , he went on to say that the two germans may have lacked the mental flexibility to understand the type of situation they are trying to control . quoting from the draft of an economic report set for publication in early 2009 , the newsmagazine , in a separate article , said government experts predict a two-percent contraction in the german economy next year . " the government will watch economic developments closely , " the magazine quoted from the draft .
" if there is an intensification of the international crisis , it will use its room for maneuver to take further stabilizing measures .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am entirely convinced that we , the germans , are going to overcome this challenge .

" the government will watch economic developments closely , " the magazine quoted from the draft .
" if there is an intensification of the international crisis , it will use its room for maneuver to take further stabilizing measures .

14 , after civil unrest triggered by the shooting of a teenage boy by police . violence reignited in athens for an eighth day , with protestors firebombing a police station just moments after a peaceful vigil held in honor of a teenage boy killed in a police shooting . the latest unrest followed a candlelit vigil in front of parliament marking a week since 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos was shot dead by police on dec .

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 .
the marches of discontent were organized by opposition politicians and critics who formed a new political party to challenge the kremlin . police spokesman viktor biryukov told the interfax news agency that 90 arrests were made in moscow for participating in an illegal demonstration .
a self-proclaimed march of the dissidents in st. petersburg led to about 60 arrests . about 500 people gathered at the two demonstrations to protest the government 's reactions to the financial crisis and ongoing attempts to change the russian constitution .
eyewitnesses reported that special omon police units used violence to disperse the protesters . ahead of the arrests , a spokesman for the moscow police told the interfax news agency that authorities would be " tough but lawful " in dealing with the unsanctioned protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups have little support among the russian public witnesses said that police trucks sealed off two squares in central moscow , where the other russia coalition of opposition groups wanted to start its march .
police cordons prevented a handful of opposition supporters from entering the squares , reuters news agency reported . " they are saving their money , " sergei gulyayev , a senior member of other russia coalition , told a rally in st. petersburg .
" they will not save the russian economy .
with this government , this president and this prime minister we are heading to a collapse . " despite the media attention they receive , opposition groups enjoy little support among the broader russian public , particularly as the country 's economy has improved over the last eight years . one day after opposition party founded the detentions came a day after russian opposition politicians and kremlin critics garry kasparov and boris nemtsov founded a new political party named solidarity . according to the internet site kasparov.ru on sunday , among those arrested by police was writer eduard limonov , head of outlawed national-bolshevik party .
according to media reports , omon units also arrested about 50 former officers who sought to join the opposition protests . " we are only trying to exercise our constitutional rights to demonstrate peacefully , " kasparov said . saturday 's announcement of the new solidarity political party was seen as an effort by the traditionally splintered russian opposition to try to unite against what it sees as an increasingly authoritarian kremlin . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a never-ending process , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social change -pipe- 14.12.2008 europe does n't have sole claim to the enlightenment , says poet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says islamic civilization was at its peak well before european greats came along the west should keep in mind that islamic civilization reached its peak long before europe 's enlightenment , says german poet hans magnus enzensberger , adding that isolation is a death sentence for every culture . deutsche welle : in dubai , we are witnessing the realization of a gigantic modernization project - albeit without the adoption of " western values " such as democracy and the rule of law .
can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .
hans magnus enzensberger was born in kaufbeuren in 1929 .
he studied german literature and philosophy and worked as an editor in radio and publishing .
he spent some years living in norway and then berlin , and has been based in munich since 1980 .
enzensberger 's work , particularly as a poet and essayist , has had a profound influence on german literature since the 1960s .
he has also played a key role in german publishing .
in 1965 he founded the magazine kursbuch -lrb- which he edited until 1975 -rrb- , in 1980 the magazine transatlantik -lrb- editor until 1982 -rrb- , and he published the book series die andere bibliothek -lrb- eichborn verlag -rrb- from 1985 to 2004 . interview : loay mudhoon , qantara.de -lrb- kd / ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can this experiment succeed in the long run ?
and should we be content with this purely technical or administrative modernization from above ?
hans magnus enzensberger : as we can see , the gulf region is going through a breathtaking modernization project like no other , particularly in dubai .
this accelerated , primarily economic modernization is being pushed by the rulers ; and without a doubt it is bringing more openness and a great deal of momentum into the countries in question .
this certainly plays a role in the onset of modern values in the region , however slow that may be .
in the case of dubai and its ruler sheikh mohamed bin rashid al maktoum , we are looking at a kind of " enlightened autocracy " in my opinion .
so it is more than mere technical modernization .
in your opening address at a recent german-arab cultural dialogue in dubai , you emphasized that europeans claiming the enlightenment for themselves could only be a half-truth .
what exactly do you mean by that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al maktoum 's rule is an ' enlightened autocracy , ' says enzensberger as we can tell by the different names for enlightenment , it is a very complex phenomenon with varying nuances and parameters , depending on the country and the language .
enlightenment is a work of humankind ; it has its own inherent contradictions and paradoxes .
in my opening speech , i wanted to make people aware that the europeans possess no kind of copyright on enlightenment , even though many in the west cite the greeks as a historical model .
the numerous attempts by many europeans to claim the enlightenment for themselves are half-truths at best .
i wanted to remind the audience that what the " west " tends to forget is the fact that islamic civilization in arab andalusia was at its height many centuries before david hume and john locke , diderot and immanuel kant wrote their epochal works .
for two centuries , arab andalusia was an incomparable center of philosophical and scientific scholarship .
muslims , jews and christians held critical debates there on all sorts of issues , without fear of religious controversy .
the aristotelian tradition would probably have died out without their work .
dante and nikolaus cusanus , giordano bruno and spinoza owe their islamic teachers just as much as do modern astronomy , logic , optics , mathematics , medicine and - not least - poetry .
as we all know , though , this heyday was not to last .
that prompts the question of whether the current situation in islamic culture calls for a new enlightenment in the european sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger says cultural isolation is dangerous regarding the deficits in the islamic and arab region , we are dealing with bitter truths , particularly in the education sector .
the number of translations into arabic is a perfect illustration .
from the time of kalif al-mamun until recently , over a period of twelve hundred years , far too few books have been translated into arabic - only the same number of translations as appear in a single year in modern-day spain .
at the recent german-arab dialogue forum , the swiss writer adolf muschg emphasized the role of culture in international relations , above all as an instrument for rapprochement and mutual understanding .
do you agree ?
the fact that respected german and arab writers and opinion-makers are meeting here and talking with unusual openness about what we have in common - and also about differing positions - shows that people in the cultural sector can actually get things moving , beyond the realms of politics and business .
and when it comes to cultural dialogue , allow me to point out one fact : every culture will die of thirst in the long run if it isolates itself and renounces the free exchange of ideas .

they include a young man covered in vomit after a night out , a club-goer who has soiled his trousers after excessive alcohol consumption and a teenage football fan beaten up in a drunken brawl .
the images decorate 1.5 million coasters and are also available for viewing as video spots on web sites frequented by young people .
the campaign , bearing the slogan " do n't drink too much - stay gold " was initiated by police after statistics showed an alarming rise in binge drinking .
too much alcohol can lead to violence according to sabine baetzing , the government 's drugs commissioner , nearly 20,000 young germans are admitted to hospital every year suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoning .
how badly this can end is shown in one of the video spots where paramedics are unable to resuscitate a young man who has collapsed into unconsciousness after drinking too much .
the campaign is also meant to draw attention to the link between excessive alcohol consumption and violence .
three out of 10 violent crimes solved in germany are committed under the influence of alcohol , according to police .
the percentage of young offenders involved rose from 38.5 percent in 2006 to 39.3 percent in 2007 .
but it is not only drunken offenders who are being targeted by the campaign - it is the victims as well .

bildunterschrift : the graphic images are intended to give binge drinkers a dose of reality binge drinking on the rise among youth " the trend towards excessive drinking by young people has continued unabated , " says baetzing .
" one in five drinks five or more glasses of alcohol at least once a month .
violence often follows such drinking bouts . "
a new survey of young people showed that 26 percent of those questioned admitted to participating in binge drinking sessions in the past month , consuming copious amounts of beer , wine or spirits .
" i like a glass of wine myself on occasion , " said conservative politician joerg schoenbohm , one of the backers of the campaign .
" but the question is where do you draw the line . "
the video clips and coasters attempt to show the two sides of the same coin .
the front of the coasters depict party scenes where young people are enjoying themselves , sipping just a small amount of alcohol .
on flip sides there are repulsive scenes of where inebriation can end .
" adults may find the message too strong , " says baetzing .
" but the campaign is directed at young people , and tests have shown they are receptive to such drastic action . "
police , athletes say getting drunk is " uncool " british experts might beg to differ .
a study released earlier this year said anti-drinking campaigns showing young people passing out in public or being helped home could be misconceived .
" extreme inebriation is often seen as a source of personal esteem and social affirmation amongst young people , " according to the survey by three universities in england .
to get to terms with the problem , berlin 's central mitte district is planning to ban drinking in public at squares such as alexanderplatz , a popular meeting point for young people .

it was the first glass repair on the 110m x 60m -lrb- 374ft x 204ft -rrb- masterpiece at the national botanic garden of wales , eight years after it opened .
a replacement was finally lowered into place after a four-day operation .
the pane , one of 785 in the great glasshouse in carmarthenshire , cracked at least two-and-a-half years ago .
the glasshouse was designed by leading architect lord norman foster , and workers from metallbau fruhand , the german contractors who look after the roof vents system were up to the big and delicate job .
garden marketing manager david hardy said there were several theories as to how it broke , including aircraft debris dropping onto it .
but the most likely explanation was that something wrong in the frame caused tension in the glass , and it shattered .
" about 100 of the 785 windows in the roof open to regulate the humidity , but two or three have been permanently stuck open .
" while the contractors were here fixing that they were also able to replace the broken pane . "
glass sandwich mr hardy said it had been a " tricky operation " .
the pane measures roughly 4m x 1.5m -lrb- 13ft 6in x 5ft -rrb- and weighs about half a tonne .
because of the shape of the great glasshouse and the landscape below it , the contractors were probably working 40ft -lrb- 12m -rrb- up for much of the operation .
each glass plane in the glasshouse consists of two 9mm -lrb- 0.35in -rrb- thick sheets of glass with a laminated film in between making a glass sandwich 18mm -lrb- 0.7in -rrb- thick in total .
" luckily , it 's laminated so nothing fell out , " he added .
the garden , near llandeilo , attracts 160,000 visitors a year .
the great glasshouse dome is tilted by seven degrees on its axis and is orientated to face south , so helping to capture the maximum amount of sunlight in a day .
inside , it is divided into into regions including the mediterranean basin -lrb- and the canary islands -rrb- , costal california , chile , the cape province of south africa and south western australia .

it was the first glass repair on the 110m x 60m -lrb- 374ft x 204ft -rrb- masterpiece at the national botanic garden of wales , eight years after it opened .
a replacement was finally lowered into place after a four-day operation .
the pane , one of 785 in the great glasshouse in carmarthenshire , cracked at least two-and-a-half years ago .
the glasshouse was designed by leading architect lord norman foster , and workers from metallbau fruhand , the german contractors who look after the roof vents system were up to the big and delicate job .
garden marketing manager david hardy said there were several theories as to how it broke , including aircraft debris dropping onto it .
but the most likely explanation was that something wrong in the frame caused tension in the glass , and it shattered .
" about 100 of the 785 windows in the roof open to regulate the humidity , but two or three have been permanently stuck open .
" while the contractors were here fixing that they were also able to replace the broken pane . "
glass sandwich mr hardy said it had been a " tricky operation " .
the pane measures roughly 4m x 1.5m -lrb- 13ft 6in x 5ft -rrb- and weighs about half a tonne .
because of the shape of the great glasshouse and the landscape below it , the contractors were probably working 40ft -lrb- 12m -rrb- up for much of the operation .
each glass plane in the glasshouse consists of two 9mm -lrb- 0.35in -rrb- thick sheets of glass with a laminated film in between making a glass sandwich 18mm -lrb- 0.7in -rrb- thick in total .
" luckily , it 's laminated so nothing fell out , " he added .
the garden , near llandeilo , attracts 160,000 visitors a year .
the great glasshouse dome is tilted by seven degrees on its axis and is orientated to face south , so helping to capture the maximum amount of sunlight in a day .
inside , it is divided into into regions including the mediterranean basin -lrb- and the canary islands -rrb- , costal california , chile , the cape province of south africa and south western australia .

the research , involving glasgow university , said those using methadone took heroin on a fewer amount of days , but they committed just as much crime .
the tories said scotland was over-dependant on methadone and last month claimed annual costs had risen by 19 % .
the scottish government said it aimed to provide the right support rather than promote one type of treatment .
however , one of the authors of the report , prof neil mckeganey , of glasgow university 's centre for drug misuse research , said it raised a question about the " gargantuan " size of scotland 's " £ 25m " methadone programme .
if they 've established criminality as part of their lifestyle then there is a strong impetus for that to continue prof neil mckeganey university of glasgow " one of the major drivers for the methadone programme in scotland has been the belief that by providing methadone there will be a substantial reduction in the crimes addicts commit , " he said .
" what this research has identified is that that is not being borne out .
" that must be a worry because that was often presented as one of the reasons why scotland has encouraged the development of such a wide-ranging methadone programme . "
prof mckeganey said criminality among addicts was linked to more things than just drug use .
" if they 've established criminality as part of their lifestyle then there is a strong impetus for that to continue , " he said .
' different routes ' scottish conservative leader annabel goldie said the new analysis shattered one of the alleged benefits of methadone programmes .
she said the research was " another wake-up call to those who insist that the wholesale parking of addicts on a legal drug is preferable to leaving them on an illegal one " .
a scottish government spokeswoman said the national drugs strategy , launched in may , recognised the need to help people move on from methadone through other treatments .
" different people with different circumstances inevitably means different routes to recovery , " she said .
" the challenge is to make sure that the right support is available at the time it is needed , rather than promoting one particular type of treatment . "
researchers looked at the behaviour of more than 400 drug users , including 68 who were using methadone at the start .

twins sir david and sir frederick , 73 , told the sunday telegraph they were responding to what people had voted for in the island 's elections last week .
they said voters rejected their candidates who supported more radical reforms of sark 's feudal system .
the brothers own land on sark , all of neighbouring island brecqhou and , among other firms , the telegraph media group .
sark 's first election to choose a democratic government for nearly 450 years was held last wednesday .
there is no point in continuing to invest £ 5m per annum when the sark electorate has said very clearly that it does not want their representatives involved barclay brothers statement the barclay brothers announced the withdrawal of their sark investments after the majority of candidates they had backed for sark 's new 28-member chamber failed to win election .
the multi-millionaire twins object to the hereditary post of seigneur , as well as the seneschal who acts as both chief judge and the speaker in the island 's government , the chief pleas .
the closure of their firms - including hotels , shops , estate agents , building firms and restaurants - led to the loss of 140 jobs .
' endorsement hope ' in a statement to the telegraph , the brothers said they still had a " passion for the island " which they had " loved since they visited it as children " .
but , they said , the barclay family had " hoped for some endorsement of their vision for sark from the electorate last wednesday " .
" sir david had made it quite clear before the election that , if this did not materialise , they would have to reconsider their investment programme .
that is what has happened , " it continued .
" as they see it , there is no point in continuing to invest £ 5m per annum when the sark electorate has said very clearly that it does not want their representatives involved with sark . "
the brothers regarded the election as a referendum on their plans to continue investing in sark , which has a population of just under 500 .
sir david had warned before the election that he and his brother were " tempted to walk away from sark … if the establishment gets re-elected " .
politicians in jersey have pledged their support for the islanders who lost their jobs and there have been offers of financial support from guernsey .
conseiller paul armorgie , one of the newly-elected members of sark 's chief pleas said the island , would still move forward to " a shiny new democracy " .

ministers aim to create a scottish web domain - " .scot " or " .sco " - and have set up a working group .
the group is making preparations to bid for a new domain in 2009 , when the body responsible for internet naming will invite applications for new ones .
mr salmond is visiting the spanish region of catalonia , which has its own " .cat " domain name .
during his barcelona visit , the first minister will hear about the success of catalonia 's generic top level domain -lrb- gtld -rrb- name .
' extensive diaspora ' the .cat domain has been operating successfully for more than two years and has attracted about 30,000 registrations .
mr salmond said : " the time is ripe for the worldwide family of scots to have their own domain reflecting an online community defined by a shared commitment to scottish identity , culture and economic promotion .
" it is not only for scots who live in scotland but for our extensive diaspora and it will be particularly appropriate for a bid to be made during the 2009 year of homecoming . "
the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the international body responsible for the domain name system , is to invite applications for new gtlds during 2009 .
the scottish government has set up a working group to prepare the ground for a bid .
research carried out by the office of the chief researcher suggests the majority of scottish organisations and institutions -lrb- 58 % -rrb- backed the principle of a scottish domain .
an international survey indicated even stronger support , with 82 % in favour .
in both samples the research suggested that .scot was the preferred choice .
