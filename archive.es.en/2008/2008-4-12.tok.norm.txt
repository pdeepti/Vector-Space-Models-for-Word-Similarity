we have to define what sustainable energy means : the term comprises the energy efficiency of buildings , transportation , industrial processes and renewable energy , namely photovoltaics , solar thermal , biomass , wind , geothermal and hydro . we at the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems are involved in research oriented towards the technological application .

for instance , if you put solar modules on your roof , the modules consist of individual solar cells that are electrically connected and laminated .

after a successful year in business , others want to open up more fitness centers where devout women can get a great work-out while remaining modest . the city of cologne is a true melting pot , with one of the largest muslim populations in germany .
in the ehrenfeld city district , muslim women who want to be physically fit can follow the lead of female personal trainers at the " hayat " -lrb- which means " life " in turkish -rrb- gym and still keep their clothes on . whether it 's running on the treadmill , rowing on a machine , or doing aerobics to turkish pop music , trainers emine and yasmin do their best to help modestly dressed muslim women get in shape . the fitness crowd does not just have access to a full range of gym machines and exercise bikes , they can also take a break in the prayer room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping iron does n't always have to mean showing a lot of skin but , you wo n't find these women wearing short shorts , flashing skin or working out for the sake of being seen .
many even don headscarves while they work the machines . customers from different countries emine aydemir , the 39-year-old owner of the fitness club now celebrating its first anniversary , knows why her business has been a success . " many women who wear scarves come here because so many other gyms treat them badly , " she told dpa news service .
" at hayat , they feel at home and nobody stares at them because of what they 're wearing . " she said she has around 350 customers ; 90 percent are turkish , or turkish-german , the rest are from morocco , tunisia , romania and egypt .
the average age is 30 , and some non-muslim german women are also members , since being muslim is not a requirement . " we muslim women do n't envy one another 's bodies , " aydemir told dpa .
" we do n't stare at each another and compare our figures .
we accept each other as we are , " she said . muslimas on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hayat fitness club in cologne dssv , an organization representing fitness and spa-industry employers throughout germany , said only one other gym - in the northern city of hamburg - caters specially to muslimas . dssv 's refit kamberovic said it was an opportunity for investors in other urban areas in germany to develop the market niche . aydemir also said she believes others are gearing up to imitate her idea . " i 've fielded a lot of phone calls from people who ask exactly how they should go about setting up a gym like this , " she said .
" i tell them the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and to emphasize health , enjoyment and sharing . " even so , being among other muslims is what attracts many women to " hayat . " hatice aydin , a 27-year-old who works out every day , told dpa : " before i came here , i used to go to another women-only gym , but i was the only one there wearing a headscarf .
they were always giving me funny looks . " i had to go into the toilet cubicles to get undressed and dressed , " she said .
" a lot of german women do n't know our etiquette and they were always staring at me if i got dressed in the group changing rooms . " respecting modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and emphasize health " aydemir explained that she was taught that islam forbids exposing any part of the body between the bosom and knees , even to other women . so , changing rooms and showers at hayat are divided into cubicles to respect this rule of modesty , and women who want to use the saunas wrap up in towels .
even busy mothers can get their work-out .
they can drop off their kids at a playroom in the gym . husbands are not permitted inside , nor are mailmen or repairmen . gulay , 29 , who has worked hard to train her abs , told dpa that she would n't want to get in shape anywhere else . " i certainly would never work out in a gym with men in the same room , " she said .
" if there were men here , i 'd find that very upsetting .
it would not be my kind of space at all . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel also urged china to overcome it " fear " of dialogue . merkel , who met tibet 's spiritual leader in exile last september , will be in latin america during his next visit to germany may 16-20 when he will meet lower house speaker norbert lammert . " but i will most certainly meet the dalai lama at a later date , " she told the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine in an article released in advance . " my receiving the dalai lama and china 's behavior towards him are two entirely separate things , " she was quoted as saying .

finance chiefs outlined several immediate steps for improvement at their meeting in washington . " the turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " said financial chiefs from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan and the us after their meeting in the american capital on friday , april 11 . the group of seven finance ministers and banking leaders emphasized their strong commitment to work together and the need for greater transparency in the financial sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial leaders want to work together , but some are wary of closer monitoring ongoing weakness in us residential housing markets , stressed global financial market conditions , the international impact of high oil and commodity prices , and inflationary pressures were the major struggles facing the global economy , said the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 major industrial countries . change of tone on currency they noted " sharp fluctuations " in major currencies since their last meeting in tokyo in february .
while saying they were " concerned about the possible implications for economic and financial stability , " the officials also called for calm in response to concerns by european leaders over volatile foreign exchange markets . the expression of its concern represented the first shift in four years in the g7 's stance on currencies .
" this change in the language … shows a concern we have not seen for some years , " said italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa . major central banks have recently undertaken multi-billion dollar cash injections into turbulent financial markets recently as the dollar has plunged to record lows . the group , however , did not declare the us economy in recession - a term experts have been hesitant to use - nor did it recommend the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets , an idea that had been widely discussed before the meeting . banks have already written down some $ 225 billion in assets ties to failing mortgages and loans in 2007 and 2008 , said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . " numbers like that can cause a lot of fear , " he said . what next ?
experts give advice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change is easier said than done the finance chiefs strongly endorsed a report by the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- , comprised of central bankers and regulators , which it had commissioned to recommend ways to turn around the current bleak situation and prevent a recurrence . " firms should fully and promptly disclose their risk exposures , write-downs , and fair value estimates for complex and illiquid instruments , " recommended the financial leaders . in addition , they said that the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- and other standard-setters should " initiate urgent action to improve the accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet entities " and provide closer guidance in valuing financial instruments . " off-balance sheet entities have been blamed for covering up the true extent of banks ' exposure to the us high-risk subprime mortgage crisis , as it prevented risks from being fairly assessed . increased regulation , however , did not seem to sit well with all of the representatives . " our response needs to be measured and proportionate , " said british financial minister alistair darling .
" it is not a question of more regulation - often it is a question of regulators and management doing their job effectively . " bildunterschrift : the central bank governors met in washington imf meets the international monetary fund holds its spring meeting on saturday , april 12 , in washington , days after it warned that the economic outlook was looking increasingly grim . it forecast that global expansion would slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 , cutting its earlier predictions and warning that there was a 25 percent chance that growth would fall further , leaving the world effectively in recession in 2008 and 2009 . on thursday , the imf 's managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , said the organization would play a central role in confronting the global financial turbulence , adding that the current crisis was the biggest since the great depression of the 1930s . he said there is a need to analyze the links between the financial sector and the real economy and the imf was " one of those rare " institutions which could do that . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a successful year in business , others want to open up more fitness centers where devout women can get a great work-out while remaining modest . the city of cologne is a true melting pot , with one of the largest muslim populations in germany .
in the ehrenfeld city district , muslim women who want to be physically fit can follow the lead of female personal trainers at the " hayat " -lrb- which means " life " in turkish -rrb- gym and still keep their clothes on . whether it 's running on the treadmill , rowing on a machine , or doing aerobics to turkish pop music , trainers emine and yasmin do their best to help modestly dressed muslim women get in shape . the fitness crowd does not just have access to a full range of gym machines and exercise bikes , they can also take a break in the prayer room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping iron does n't always have to mean showing a lot of skin but , you wo n't find these women wearing short shorts , flashing skin or working out for the sake of being seen .
many even don headscarves while they work the machines . customers from different countries emine aydemir , the 39-year-old owner of the fitness club now celebrating its first anniversary , knows why her business has been a success . " many women who wear scarves come here because so many other gyms treat them badly , " she told dpa news service .
" at hayat , they feel at home and nobody stares at them because of what they 're wearing . " she said she has around 350 customers ; 90 percent are turkish , or turkish-german , the rest are from morocco , tunisia , romania and egypt .
the average age is 30 , and some non-muslim german women are also members , since being muslim is not a requirement . " we muslim women do n't envy one another 's bodies , " aydemir told dpa .
" we do n't stare at each another and compare our figures .
we accept each other as we are , " she said . muslimas on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hayat fitness club in cologne dssv , an organization representing fitness and spa-industry employers throughout germany , said only one other gym - in the northern city of hamburg - caters specially to muslimas . dssv 's refit kamberovic said it was an opportunity for investors in other urban areas in germany to develop the market niche . aydemir also said she believes others are gearing up to imitate her idea . " i 've fielded a lot of phone calls from people who ask exactly how they should go about setting up a gym like this , " she said .
" i tell them the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and to emphasize health , enjoyment and sharing . " even so , being among other muslims is what attracts many women to " hayat . " hatice aydin , a 27-year-old who works out every day , told dpa : " before i came here , i used to go to another women-only gym , but i was the only one there wearing a headscarf .
they were always giving me funny looks . " i had to go into the toilet cubicles to get undressed and dressed , " she said .
" a lot of german women do n't know our etiquette and they were always staring at me if i got dressed in the group changing rooms . " respecting modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and emphasize health " aydemir explained that she was taught that islam forbids exposing any part of the body between the bosom and knees , even to other women . so , changing rooms and showers at hayat are divided into cubicles to respect this rule of modesty , and women who want to use the saunas wrap up in towels .
even busy mothers can get their work-out .
they can drop off their kids at a playroom in the gym . husbands are not permitted inside , nor are mailmen or repairmen . gulay , 29 , who has worked hard to train her abs , told dpa that she would n't want to get in shape anywhere else . " i certainly would never work out in a gym with men in the same room , " she said .

in the ehrenfeld city district , muslim women who want to be physically fit can follow the lead of female personal trainers at the " hayat " -lrb- which means " life " in turkish -rrb- gym and still keep their clothes on . whether it 's running on the treadmill , rowing on a machine , or doing aerobics to turkish pop music , trainers emine and yasmin do their best to help modestly dressed muslim women get in shape . the fitness crowd does not just have access to a full range of gym machines and exercise bikes , they can also take a break in the prayer room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping iron does n't always have to mean showing a lot of skin but , you wo n't find these women wearing short shorts , flashing skin or working out for the sake of being seen .
many even don headscarves while they work the machines . customers from different countries emine aydemir , the 39-year-old owner of the fitness club now celebrating its first anniversary , knows why her business has been a success . " many women who wear scarves come here because so many other gyms treat them badly , " she told dpa news service .
" at hayat , they feel at home and nobody stares at them because of what they 're wearing . " she said she has around 350 customers ; 90 percent are turkish , or turkish-german , the rest are from morocco , tunisia , romania and egypt .
the average age is 30 , and some non-muslim german women are also members , since being muslim is not a requirement . " we muslim women do n't envy one another 's bodies , " aydemir told dpa .
" we do n't stare at each another and compare our figures .
we accept each other as we are , " she said . muslimas on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hayat fitness club in cologne dssv , an organization representing fitness and spa-industry employers throughout germany , said only one other gym - in the northern city of hamburg - caters specially to muslimas . dssv 's refit kamberovic said it was an opportunity for investors in other urban areas in germany to develop the market niche . aydemir also said she believes others are gearing up to imitate her idea . " i 've fielded a lot of phone calls from people who ask exactly how they should go about setting up a gym like this , " she said .
" i tell them the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and to emphasize health , enjoyment and sharing . " even so , being among other muslims is what attracts many women to " hayat . " hatice aydin , a 27-year-old who works out every day , told dpa : " before i came here , i used to go to another women-only gym , but i was the only one there wearing a headscarf .
they were always giving me funny looks . " i had to go into the toilet cubicles to get undressed and dressed , " she said .
" a lot of german women do n't know our etiquette and they were always staring at me if i got dressed in the group changing rooms . " respecting modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and emphasize health " aydemir explained that she was taught that islam forbids exposing any part of the body between the bosom and knees , even to other women . so , changing rooms and showers at hayat are divided into cubicles to respect this rule of modesty , and women who want to use the saunas wrap up in towels .
even busy mothers can get their work-out .
they can drop off their kids at a playroom in the gym . husbands are not permitted inside , nor are mailmen or repairmen . gulay , 29 , who has worked hard to train her abs , told dpa that she would n't want to get in shape anywhere else . " i certainly would never work out in a gym with men in the same room , " she said .
" if there were men here , i 'd find that very upsetting .
it would not be my kind of space at all . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a subsequent investigation led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned in february from his position as ceo of deutsche post . the current trial is expected to revive questions about the ethics of the german intelligence service bnd buying a list of tax dodgers from another liechtenstein bank , lgt , for 4.2 million euros earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finance chiefs outlined several immediate steps for improvement at their meeting in washington . " the turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " said financial chiefs from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan and the us after their meeting in the american capital on friday , april 11 . the group of seven finance ministers and banking leaders emphasized their strong commitment to work together and the need for greater transparency in the financial sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial leaders want to work together , but some are wary of closer monitoring ongoing weakness in us residential housing markets , stressed global financial market conditions , the international impact of high oil and commodity prices , and inflationary pressures were the major struggles facing the global economy , said the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 major industrial countries . change of tone on currency they noted " sharp fluctuations " in major currencies since their last meeting in tokyo in february .
while saying they were " concerned about the possible implications for economic and financial stability , " the officials also called for calm in response to concerns by european leaders over volatile foreign exchange markets . the expression of its concern represented the first shift in four years in the g7 's stance on currencies .
" this change in the language … shows a concern we have not seen for some years , " said italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa . major central banks have recently undertaken multi-billion dollar cash injections into turbulent financial markets recently as the dollar has plunged to record lows . the group , however , did not declare the us economy in recession - a term experts have been hesitant to use - nor did it recommend the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets , an idea that had been widely discussed before the meeting . banks have already written down some $ 225 billion in assets ties to failing mortgages and loans in 2007 and 2008 , said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . " numbers like that can cause a lot of fear , " he said . what next ?
experts give advice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change is easier said than done the finance chiefs strongly endorsed a report by the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- , comprised of central bankers and regulators , which it had commissioned to recommend ways to turn around the current bleak situation and prevent a recurrence . " firms should fully and promptly disclose their risk exposures , write-downs , and fair value estimates for complex and illiquid instruments , " recommended the financial leaders . in addition , they said that the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- and other standard-setters should " initiate urgent action to improve the accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet entities " and provide closer guidance in valuing financial instruments . " off-balance sheet entities have been blamed for covering up the true extent of banks ' exposure to the us high-risk subprime mortgage crisis , as it prevented risks from being fairly assessed . increased regulation , however , did not seem to sit well with all of the representatives . " our response needs to be measured and proportionate , " said british financial minister alistair darling .
" it is not a question of more regulation - often it is a question of regulators and management doing their job effectively . " bildunterschrift : the central bank governors met in washington imf meets the international monetary fund holds its spring meeting on saturday , april 12 , in washington , days after it warned that the economic outlook was looking increasingly grim . it forecast that global expansion would slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 , cutting its earlier predictions and warning that there was a 25 percent chance that growth would fall further , leaving the world effectively in recession in 2008 and 2009 . on thursday , the imf 's managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , said the organization would play a central role in confronting the global financial turbulence , adding that the current crisis was the biggest since the great depression of the 1930s . he said there is a need to analyze the links between the financial sector and the real economy and the imf was " one of those rare " institutions which could do that . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

human rights and economic relationships were not mutually exclusive , she said , adding : " in my opinion , they have to fit together . merkel has remained unapologetic in the face of any criticism of the new approach .

merkel also urged china to overcome it " fear " of dialogue . merkel , who met tibet 's spiritual leader in exile last september , will be in latin america during his next visit to germany may 16-20 when he will meet lower house speaker norbert lammert . " but i will most certainly meet the dalai lama at a later date , " she told the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine in an article released in advance . " my receiving the dalai lama and china 's behavior towards him are two entirely separate things , " she was quoted as saying . " but both guide the way in which we behave in matters of respect or non-respect of human rights , and here germany 's attitude is explicit , including receiving the dalai lama , " merkel added . bitter reaction to last visit merkel has been more vocal than her predecessor gerhard schroeder in criticising the human rights records of russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted the meeting to underline her willingness to address human rights issues her last meeting with the dalai lama precipitated a crisis in relations between beijing and germany , china 's biggest trading partner in europe . it was only in january during a visit here by chinese foreign minister yang jiechi that his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier could speak of a return to normality . merkel has rejected an olympics boycott , saying this would only penalize athletes who plan to compete and not help tibetans .
her spokesman said she would not attend the opening in beijing in august , but stressed that this had never been planned . calls for dialogue last month merkel called for peaceful and direct dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama over the current unrest in tibet .

she has pressed china , russia and zimbabwe on the issue .
in her weekly internet podcast , the chancellor said she would address the council of europe on human rights next week . she said rights throughout the world were " an important pillar " of berlin 's policy alongside advancing germany 's own interests .
human rights and economic relationships were not mutually exclusive , she said , adding : " in my opinion , they have to fit together . merkel has remained unapologetic in the face of any criticism of the new approach .

even busy mothers can get their work-out .
they can drop off their kids at a playroom in the gym . husbands are not permitted inside , nor are mailmen or repairmen . gulay , 29 , who has worked hard to train her abs , told dpa that she would n't want to get in shape anywhere else .

merkel also urged china to overcome it " fear " of dialogue . merkel , who met tibet 's spiritual leader in exile last september , will be in latin america during his next visit to germany may 16-20 when he will meet lower house speaker norbert lammert . " but i will most certainly meet the dalai lama at a later date , " she told the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine in an article released in advance . " my receiving the dalai lama and china 's behavior towards him are two entirely separate things , " she was quoted as saying . " but both guide the way in which we behave in matters of respect or non-respect of human rights , and here germany 's attitude is explicit , including receiving the dalai lama , " merkel added . bitter reaction to last visit merkel has been more vocal than her predecessor gerhard schroeder in criticising the human rights records of russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted the meeting to underline her willingness to address human rights issues her last meeting with the dalai lama precipitated a crisis in relations between beijing and germany , china 's biggest trading partner in europe . it was only in january during a visit here by chinese foreign minister yang jiechi that his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier could speak of a return to normality . merkel has rejected an olympics boycott , saying this would only penalize athletes who plan to compete and not help tibetans .

finance chiefs outlined several immediate steps for improvement at their meeting in washington . " the turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " said financial chiefs from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan and the us after their meeting in the american capital on friday , april 11 . the group of seven finance ministers and banking leaders emphasized their strong commitment to work together and the need for greater transparency in the financial sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial leaders want to work together , but some are wary of closer monitoring ongoing weakness in us residential housing markets , stressed global financial market conditions , the international impact of high oil and commodity prices , and inflationary pressures were the major struggles facing the global economy , said the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 major industrial countries . change of tone on currency they noted " sharp fluctuations " in major currencies since their last meeting in tokyo in february .
while saying they were " concerned about the possible implications for economic and financial stability , " the officials also called for calm in response to concerns by european leaders over volatile foreign exchange markets . the expression of its concern represented the first shift in four years in the g7 's stance on currencies .
" this change in the language … shows a concern we have not seen for some years , " said italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa . major central banks have recently undertaken multi-billion dollar cash injections into turbulent financial markets recently as the dollar has plunged to record lows . the group , however , did not declare the us economy in recession - a term experts have been hesitant to use - nor did it recommend the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets , an idea that had been widely discussed before the meeting . banks have already written down some $ 225 billion in assets ties to failing mortgages and loans in 2007 and 2008 , said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . " numbers like that can cause a lot of fear , " he said . what next ?
experts give advice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change is easier said than done the finance chiefs strongly endorsed a report by the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- , comprised of central bankers and regulators , which it had commissioned to recommend ways to turn around the current bleak situation and prevent a recurrence . " firms should fully and promptly disclose their risk exposures , write-downs , and fair value estimates for complex and illiquid instruments , " recommended the financial leaders . in addition , they said that the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- and other standard-setters should " initiate urgent action to improve the accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet entities " and provide closer guidance in valuing financial instruments . " off-balance sheet entities have been blamed for covering up the true extent of banks ' exposure to the us high-risk subprime mortgage crisis , as it prevented risks from being fairly assessed . increased regulation , however , did not seem to sit well with all of the representatives . " our response needs to be measured and proportionate , " said british financial minister alistair darling .
" it is not a question of more regulation - often it is a question of regulators and management doing their job effectively . " bildunterschrift : the central bank governors met in washington imf meets the international monetary fund holds its spring meeting on saturday , april 12 , in washington , days after it warned that the economic outlook was looking increasingly grim . it forecast that global expansion would slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 , cutting its earlier predictions and warning that there was a 25 percent chance that growth would fall further , leaving the world effectively in recession in 2008 and 2009 . on thursday , the imf 's managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , said the organization would play a central role in confronting the global financial turbulence , adding that the current crisis was the biggest since the great depression of the 1930s . he said there is a need to analyze the links between the financial sector and the real economy and the imf was " one of those rare " institutions which could do that . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

human rights and economic relationships were not mutually exclusive , she said , adding : " in my opinion , they have to fit together . merkel has remained unapologetic in the face of any criticism of the new approach .

after a successful year in business , others want to open up more fitness centers where devout women can get a great work-out while remaining modest . the city of cologne is a true melting pot , with one of the largest muslim populations in germany .
in the ehrenfeld city district , muslim women who want to be physically fit can follow the lead of female personal trainers at the " hayat " -lrb- which means " life " in turkish -rrb- gym and still keep their clothes on . whether it 's running on the treadmill , rowing on a machine , or doing aerobics to turkish pop music , trainers emine and yasmin do their best to help modestly dressed muslim women get in shape . the fitness crowd does not just have access to a full range of gym machines and exercise bikes , they can also take a break in the prayer room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping iron does n't always have to mean showing a lot of skin but , you wo n't find these women wearing short shorts , flashing skin or working out for the sake of being seen .

" many women who wear scarves come here because so many other gyms treat them badly , " she told dpa news service .
" at hayat , they feel at home and nobody stares at them because of what they 're wearing . " she said she has around 350 customers ; 90 percent are turkish , or turkish-german , the rest are from morocco , tunisia , romania and egypt .
the average age is 30 , and some non-muslim german women are also members , since being muslim is not a requirement . " we muslim women do n't envy one another 's bodies , " aydemir told dpa .
" we do n't stare at each another and compare our figures .
we accept each other as we are , " she said . muslimas on the move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hayat fitness club in cologne dssv , an organization representing fitness and spa-industry employers throughout germany , said only one other gym - in the northern city of hamburg - caters specially to muslimas . dssv 's refit kamberovic said it was an opportunity for investors in other urban areas in germany to develop the market niche . aydemir also said she believes others are gearing up to imitate her idea . " i 've fielded a lot of phone calls from people who ask exactly how they should go about setting up a gym like this , " she said .
" i tell them the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and to emphasize health , enjoyment and sharing . " even so , being among other muslims is what attracts many women to " hayat . " hatice aydin , a 27-year-old who works out every day , told dpa : " before i came here , i used to go to another women-only gym , but i was the only one there wearing a headscarf .
they were always giving me funny looks . " i had to go into the toilet cubicles to get undressed and dressed , " she said .
" a lot of german women do n't know our etiquette and they were always staring at me if i got dressed in the group changing rooms . " respecting modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the recipe for success is to ban the cult of beautiful bodies and emphasize health " aydemir explained that she was taught that islam forbids exposing any part of the body between the bosom and knees , even to other women . so , changing rooms and showers at hayat are divided into cubicles to respect this rule of modesty , and women who want to use the saunas wrap up in towels .
even busy mothers can get their work-out .
they can drop off their kids at a playroom in the gym . husbands are not permitted inside , nor are mailmen or repairmen . gulay , 29 , who has worked hard to train her abs , told dpa that she would n't want to get in shape anywhere else .

germany 's foreign minister will kick off the venture on the sidelines of his us visit . roland schindler is co-director of a fledgling us-german cooperation between the massachusetts institute of technology and the freiburg-based fraunhofer institute for solar energy system .
the project focuses on sustainable energy systems and is being launched on saturday , april 12 , in the course of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's visit to the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice agree that sustainable energy is a worthy goal dw-world.de : tell us a bit about the project and its aims . roland schindler : what we want to establish in the united states is a center for sustainable energy systems .
we have to define what sustainable energy means : the term comprises the energy efficiency of buildings , transportation , industrial processes and renewable energy , namely photovoltaics , solar thermal , biomass , wind , geothermal and hydro . we at the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems are involved in research oriented towards the technological application .
in the end , we want to have a working system , as it is reflected already in the name of the institute . we look at components of entire systems , system theory , systems technology , etc .
for instance , if you put solar modules on your roof , the modules consist of individual solar cells that are electrically connected and laminated .
when you connect the modules you need circuitry and control mechanisms to feed the electricity generated on the roof into the power supply in your house . we 're talking about an energy cooperation between germany and the united states .
indeed , energy policies and attitudes toward the environment differ in the two countries .
does this lead to any problems ? it 's not directly an issue for us .
we see , of course , that some things will change in the next few years - especially when the new administration takes office .
in the individual states - particularly california , massachusetts and new york - there 's a strong push for renewable energies and climate goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising oil prices have gotten the americans thinking , said schindler bush torpedoed the kyoto protocol .
in contrast , the massachusetts environment minister under -lsb- president bill -rsb- clinton helped negotiate it . do you think a joint project will contribute to changing environment attitudes in the us ? i would n't say that the project alone will change the attitudes .
it 's the other way around .
the project is possible because the attitudes in the us are in the process of changing , which is evident in how open the state government in massachusetts was to it . there 's an increasing awareness of the significance of climate change and of energy efficiency as oil prices are increasing .
this will change the overall attitude , even in the federal government , over the long term . we would be delighted if our new center at mit will help to develop cost-effective products to increase the share of sustainable energy in the us energy mix , based on close cooperation with fraunhofer in germany . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the bank , the information consists mainly of internal receipts . claims have been made that the four men still possess data on at least 700 llb customers and that their lawyers have been negotiating for a lower sentence in exchange for its return . the group purportedly sought to extort an additional 4 million euros from liechtenstein for the return of the last set of data . the case follows a massive scandal involving rich germans who set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
a subsequent investigation led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned in february from his position as ceo of deutsche post . the current trial is expected to revive questions about the ethics of the german intelligence service bnd buying a list of tax dodgers from another liechtenstein bank , lgt , for 4.2 million euros earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finance chiefs outlined several immediate steps for improvement at their meeting in washington . " the turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " said financial chiefs from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan and the us after their meeting in the american capital on friday , april 11 . the group of seven finance ministers and banking leaders emphasized their strong commitment to work together and the need for greater transparency in the financial sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial leaders want to work together , but some are wary of closer monitoring ongoing weakness in us residential housing markets , stressed global financial market conditions , the international impact of high oil and commodity prices , and inflationary pressures were the major struggles facing the global economy , said the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 major industrial countries . change of tone on currency they noted " sharp fluctuations " in major currencies since their last meeting in tokyo in february .
while saying they were " concerned about the possible implications for economic and financial stability , " the officials also called for calm in response to concerns by european leaders over volatile foreign exchange markets . the expression of its concern represented the first shift in four years in the g7 's stance on currencies .
" this change in the language … shows a concern we have not seen for some years , " said italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa . major central banks have recently undertaken multi-billion dollar cash injections into turbulent financial markets recently as the dollar has plunged to record lows . the group , however , did not declare the us economy in recession - a term experts have been hesitant to use - nor did it recommend the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets , an idea that had been widely discussed before the meeting . banks have already written down some $ 225 billion in assets ties to failing mortgages and loans in 2007 and 2008 , said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . " numbers like that can cause a lot of fear , " he said . what next ?
experts give advice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change is easier said than done the finance chiefs strongly endorsed a report by the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- , comprised of central bankers and regulators , which it had commissioned to recommend ways to turn around the current bleak situation and prevent a recurrence . " firms should fully and promptly disclose their risk exposures , write-downs , and fair value estimates for complex and illiquid instruments , " recommended the financial leaders . in addition , they said that the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- and other standard-setters should " initiate urgent action to improve the accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet entities " and provide closer guidance in valuing financial instruments . " off-balance sheet entities have been blamed for covering up the true extent of banks ' exposure to the us high-risk subprime mortgage crisis , as it prevented risks from being fairly assessed . increased regulation , however , did not seem to sit well with all of the representatives . " our response needs to be measured and proportionate , " said british financial minister alistair darling .
" it is not a question of more regulation - often it is a question of regulators and management doing their job effectively . " bildunterschrift : the central bank governors met in washington imf meets the international monetary fund holds its spring meeting on saturday , april 12 , in washington , days after it warned that the economic outlook was looking increasingly grim . it forecast that global expansion would slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 , cutting its earlier predictions and warning that there was a 25 percent chance that growth would fall further , leaving the world effectively in recession in 2008 and 2009 . on thursday , the imf 's managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , said the organization would play a central role in confronting the global financial turbulence , adding that the current crisis was the biggest since the great depression of the 1930s . he said there is a need to analyze the links between the financial sector and the real economy and the imf was " one of those rare " institutions which could do that . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finance chiefs outlined several immediate steps for improvement at their meeting in washington . " the turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " said financial chiefs from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan and the us after their meeting in the american capital on friday , april 11 . the group of seven finance ministers and banking leaders emphasized their strong commitment to work together and the need for greater transparency in the financial sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial leaders want to work together , but some are wary of closer monitoring ongoing weakness in us residential housing markets , stressed global financial market conditions , the international impact of high oil and commodity prices , and inflationary pressures were the major struggles facing the global economy , said the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 major industrial countries . change of tone on currency they noted " sharp fluctuations " in major currencies since their last meeting in tokyo in february .
while saying they were " concerned about the possible implications for economic and financial stability , " the officials also called for calm in response to concerns by european leaders over volatile foreign exchange markets . the expression of its concern represented the first shift in four years in the g7 's stance on currencies .
" this change in the language … shows a concern we have not seen for some years , " said italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa . major central banks have recently undertaken multi-billion dollar cash injections into turbulent financial markets recently as the dollar has plunged to record lows . the group , however , did not declare the us economy in recession - a term experts have been hesitant to use - nor did it recommend the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets , an idea that had been widely discussed before the meeting . banks have already written down some $ 225 billion in assets ties to failing mortgages and loans in 2007 and 2008 , said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . " numbers like that can cause a lot of fear , " he said . what next ?
experts give advice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change is easier said than done the finance chiefs strongly endorsed a report by the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- , comprised of central bankers and regulators , which it had commissioned to recommend ways to turn around the current bleak situation and prevent a recurrence . " firms should fully and promptly disclose their risk exposures , write-downs , and fair value estimates for complex and illiquid instruments , " recommended the financial leaders . in addition , they said that the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- and other standard-setters should " initiate urgent action to improve the accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet entities " and provide closer guidance in valuing financial instruments . " off-balance sheet entities have been blamed for covering up the true extent of banks ' exposure to the us high-risk subprime mortgage crisis , as it prevented risks from being fairly assessed . increased regulation , however , did not seem to sit well with all of the representatives . " our response needs to be measured and proportionate , " said british financial minister alistair darling .
" it is not a question of more regulation - often it is a question of regulators and management doing their job effectively . " bildunterschrift : the central bank governors met in washington imf meets the international monetary fund holds its spring meeting on saturday , april 12 , in washington , days after it warned that the economic outlook was looking increasingly grim . it forecast that global expansion would slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 , cutting its earlier predictions and warning that there was a 25 percent chance that growth would fall further , leaving the world effectively in recession in 2008 and 2009 . on thursday , the imf 's managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , said the organization would play a central role in confronting the global financial turbulence , adding that the current crisis was the biggest since the great depression of the 1930s . he said there is a need to analyze the links between the financial sector and the real economy and the imf was " one of those rare " institutions which could do that . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is even the occasional tiger or penguin . to prevent any bruised trunks , the new facility is fitted with non-slip asphalt floors which are " more pleasant and comfortable for animals than traditional concrete , " the firm said . not only that , but built-in partitions ensure no unwanted contact between guests , and if any jet-lagged orangutan does not want to hear the hyenas in stall 17 , further sound-proof subdivisions are possible . the facility even caters for mothers and babies - or rather mares with foals for example - and surveillance cameras ensure no prize chihuahua or pricey koi carp is stolen . the new facility replaces two older hangars and will have 25 vets and 60 care staff on hand . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the bank , the information consists mainly of internal receipts . claims have been made that the four men still possess data on at least 700 llb customers and that their lawyers have been negotiating for a lower sentence in exchange for its return . the group purportedly sought to extort an additional 4 million euros from liechtenstein for the return of the last set of data . the case follows a massive scandal involving rich germans who set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
a subsequent investigation led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned in february from his position as ceo of deutsche post . the current trial is expected to revive questions about the ethics of the german intelligence service bnd buying a list of tax dodgers from another liechtenstein bank , lgt , for 4.2 million euros earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the bank , the information consists mainly of internal receipts . claims have been made that the four men still possess data on at least 700 llb customers and that their lawyers have been negotiating for a lower sentence in exchange for its return . the group purportedly sought to extort an additional 4 million euros from liechtenstein for the return of the last set of data . the case follows a massive scandal involving rich germans who set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
a subsequent investigation led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned in february from his position as ceo of deutsche post . the current trial is expected to revive questions about the ethics of the german intelligence service bnd buying a list of tax dodgers from another liechtenstein bank , lgt , for 4.2 million euros earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato promised to incorporate the pair eventually . " coming out of the bucharest summit , we have talked some about continuing to develop the alliance , " rice says , referring to the recent nato meeting in romania .

" i find it hard to understand what is going to be gained by having discussions with hamas about peace when hamas is , in fact , the impediment to peace , " said rice , responding to a question about carter 's plans at the joint press conference with steinmeier . watch for steinmeier on youtube steinmeier on saturday is scheduled to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game between the new york yankees and the boston red sox in boston 's fenway park . his american counterpart joked that this was a risky undertaking .

human rights and economic relationships were not mutually exclusive , she said , adding : " in my opinion , they have to fit together . merkel has remained unapologetic in the face of any criticism of the new approach .

merkel also urged china to overcome it " fear " of dialogue . merkel , who met tibet 's spiritual leader in exile last september , will be in latin america during his next visit to germany may 16-20 when he will meet lower house speaker norbert lammert . " but i will most certainly meet the dalai lama at a later date , " she told the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine in an article released in advance . " my receiving the dalai lama and china 's behavior towards him are two entirely separate things , " she was quoted as saying . " but both guide the way in which we behave in matters of respect or non-respect of human rights , and here germany 's attitude is explicit , including receiving the dalai lama , " merkel added . bitter reaction to last visit merkel has been more vocal than her predecessor gerhard schroeder in criticising the human rights records of russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted the meeting to underline her willingness to address human rights issues her last meeting with the dalai lama precipitated a crisis in relations between beijing and germany , china 's biggest trading partner in europe . it was only in january during a visit here by chinese foreign minister yang jiechi that his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier could speak of a return to normality . merkel has rejected an olympics boycott , saying this would only penalize athletes who plan to compete and not help tibetans .
her spokesman said she would not attend the opening in beijing in august , but stressed that this had never been planned . calls for dialogue last month merkel called for peaceful and direct dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama over the current unrest in tibet . " a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " said her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch ceremony in beijing in her comments in the newspaper interview , merkel said she hoped the olympic games this summer become a " games of dialogue " and that " china overcomes its fear of this . " criticism of style merkel faced intense criticism from her christian democrats ' partners in the ruling coalition , the social democrats , for her decision to receive the dalai lama last september . both schroeder , and steinmeier , a social democrat , said the meeting was a mistake and may have damaged germany 's interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has sharply criticized zimbabwean president mugabe for human rights violations merkel has been more forceful than her predecessors with regards to rights .
she has pressed china , russia and zimbabwe on the issue .
in her weekly internet podcast , the chancellor said she would address the council of europe on human rights next week . she said rights throughout the world were " an important pillar " of berlin 's policy alongside advancing germany 's own interests .
human rights and economic relationships were not mutually exclusive , she said , adding : " in my opinion , they have to fit together . merkel has remained unapologetic in the face of any criticism of the new approach . " human rights policy and representing our economic interests all over the world are for us two sides of the same coin , " she said in january . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finance chiefs outlined several immediate steps for improvement at their meeting in washington . " the turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " said financial chiefs from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan and the us after their meeting in the american capital on friday , april 11 . the group of seven finance ministers and banking leaders emphasized their strong commitment to work together and the need for greater transparency in the financial sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial leaders want to work together , but some are wary of closer monitoring ongoing weakness in us residential housing markets , stressed global financial market conditions , the international impact of high oil and commodity prices , and inflationary pressures were the major struggles facing the global economy , said the finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 major industrial countries . change of tone on currency they noted " sharp fluctuations " in major currencies since their last meeting in tokyo in february .
while saying they were " concerned about the possible implications for economic and financial stability , " the officials also called for calm in response to concerns by european leaders over volatile foreign exchange markets . the expression of its concern represented the first shift in four years in the g7 's stance on currencies .
" this change in the language … shows a concern we have not seen for some years , " said italian economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa . major central banks have recently undertaken multi-billion dollar cash injections into turbulent financial markets recently as the dollar has plunged to record lows . the group , however , did not declare the us economy in recession - a term experts have been hesitant to use - nor did it recommend the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets , an idea that had been widely discussed before the meeting . banks have already written down some $ 225 billion in assets ties to failing mortgages and loans in 2007 and 2008 , said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . " numbers like that can cause a lot of fear , " he said . what next ?
experts give advice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change is easier said than done the finance chiefs strongly endorsed a report by the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- , comprised of central bankers and regulators , which it had commissioned to recommend ways to turn around the current bleak situation and prevent a recurrence . " firms should fully and promptly disclose their risk exposures , write-downs , and fair value estimates for complex and illiquid instruments , " recommended the financial leaders . in addition , they said that the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- and other standard-setters should " initiate urgent action to improve the accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet entities " and provide closer guidance in valuing financial instruments . " off-balance sheet entities have been blamed for covering up the true extent of banks ' exposure to the us high-risk subprime mortgage crisis , as it prevented risks from being fairly assessed . increased regulation , however , did not seem to sit well with all of the representatives . " our response needs to be measured and proportionate , " said british financial minister alistair darling .
" it is not a question of more regulation - often it is a question of regulators and management doing their job effectively . " bildunterschrift : the central bank governors met in washington imf meets the international monetary fund holds its spring meeting on saturday , april 12 , in washington , days after it warned that the economic outlook was looking increasingly grim . it forecast that global expansion would slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 , cutting its earlier predictions and warning that there was a 25 percent chance that growth would fall further , leaving the world effectively in recession in 2008 and 2009 . on thursday , the imf 's managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , said the organization would play a central role in confronting the global financial turbulence , adding that the current crisis was the biggest since the great depression of the 1930s . he said there is a need to analyze the links between the financial sector and the real economy and the imf was " one of those rare " institutions which could do that . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel also urged china to overcome it " fear " of dialogue . merkel , who met tibet 's spiritual leader in exile last september , will be in latin america during his next visit to germany may 16-20 when he will meet lower house speaker norbert lammert . " but i will most certainly meet the dalai lama at a later date , " she told the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine in an article released in advance . " my receiving the dalai lama and china 's behavior towards him are two entirely separate things , " she was quoted as saying . " but both guide the way in which we behave in matters of respect or non-respect of human rights , and here germany 's attitude is explicit , including receiving the dalai lama , " merkel added . bitter reaction to last visit merkel has been more vocal than her predecessor gerhard schroeder in criticising the human rights records of russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wanted the meeting to underline her willingness to address human rights issues her last meeting with the dalai lama precipitated a crisis in relations between beijing and germany , china 's biggest trading partner in europe . it was only in january during a visit here by chinese foreign minister yang jiechi that his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier could speak of a return to normality . merkel has rejected an olympics boycott , saying this would only penalize athletes who plan to compete and not help tibetans .
her spokesman said she would not attend the opening in beijing in august , but stressed that this had never been planned . calls for dialogue last month merkel called for peaceful and direct dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama over the current unrest in tibet . " a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " said her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch ceremony in beijing in her comments in the newspaper interview , merkel said she hoped the olympic games this summer become a " games of dialogue " and that " china overcomes its fear of this . " criticism of style merkel faced intense criticism from her christian democrats ' partners in the ruling coalition , the social democrats , for her decision to receive the dalai lama last september . both schroeder , and steinmeier , a social democrat , said the meeting was a mistake and may have damaged germany 's interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has sharply criticized zimbabwean president mugabe for human rights violations merkel has been more forceful than her predecessors with regards to rights .
she has pressed china , russia and zimbabwe on the issue .
in her weekly internet podcast , the chancellor said she would address the council of europe on human rights next week . she said rights throughout the world were " an important pillar " of berlin 's policy alongside advancing germany 's own interests .
human rights and economic relationships were not mutually exclusive , she said , adding : " in my opinion , they have to fit together . merkel has remained unapologetic in the face of any criticism of the new approach . " human rights policy and representing our economic interests all over the world are for us two sides of the same coin , " she said in january . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is even the occasional tiger or penguin . to prevent any bruised trunks , the new facility is fitted with non-slip asphalt floors which are " more pleasant and comfortable for animals than traditional concrete , " the firm said . not only that , but built-in partitions ensure no unwanted contact between guests , and if any jet-lagged orangutan does not want to hear the hyenas in stall 17 , further sound-proof subdivisions are possible . the facility even caters for mothers and babies - or rather mares with foals for example - and surveillance cameras ensure no prize chihuahua or pricey koi carp is stolen . the new facility replaces two older hangars and will have 25 vets and 60 care staff on hand . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the bank , the information consists mainly of internal receipts . claims have been made that the four men still possess data on at least 700 llb customers and that their lawyers have been negotiating for a lower sentence in exchange for its return . the group purportedly sought to extort an additional 4 million euros from liechtenstein for the return of the last set of data . the case follows a massive scandal involving rich germans who set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
a subsequent investigation led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned in february from his position as ceo of deutsche post . the current trial is expected to revive questions about the ethics of the german intelligence service bnd buying a list of tax dodgers from another liechtenstein bank , lgt , for 4.2 million euros earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , the sites are criticised for not normally revealing exactly how much commission or payment they earn from the companies .
the comparison sites say that the amount they get paid by various companies when consumers switch is " commercially sensitive " .
but they deny any accusations of bias and say that they have made the process of finding a good deal much easier and have saved consumers millions of pounds .

there has been " a significant increase " in the number of cars parked at singleton hospital since charges were scrapped at the start of this month .
the site is close to the national pool , swansea university and the seafront .
under a welsh assembly government initiative , 120 of wales ' 130 nhs hospitals and units are no longer able to charge for parking .
the abertawe bro morgannwg university nhs trust said it will start clamping cars belonging to people who do not work at the hospital , are not patients or visiting .
we 've had some cars parked on zebra crossings , ambulance bays and pavements joanne jones , hospital trust the trust 's operational services manager joanne jones said : " as expected , this has proved a particular problem at singleton .
" we understand that finding a parking space has been frustrating on some occasions for patients and visitors .
" our car parking officers have challenged a number of drivers already but our requests have been ignored .
" as a result we 've had some cars parked on zebra crossings , ambulance bays and pavements .
" the last thing we want is to compromise safety and , as a result , we 'll be stepping up our enforcement action .
" parking on our sites is for users of the hospital only and we will be clamping vehicles , and issuing penalty notices , if we do find drivers parking there for other reasons or if vehicles are parked illegally . "
the trust said it had powers to issue penalty notices and fines up to £ 40 would be issued to those who offend .
it said there are more than 20 car parking officers on site at singleton and morriston hospitals , who will be carrying out regular patrols of public and staff parking areas and cctv in also in operation .
charges were scrapped at 120 hospitals and health units in wales on 1 april after being called " at best an inconvenience and at worst an unfair expense " by health minister edwina hart .
