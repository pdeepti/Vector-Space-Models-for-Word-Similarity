burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .

" the fundamentals of the european economies remain sound , " british prime minister gordon brown said , reading from a statement after talks with his counterparts on tuesday , jan .
29 . but he added : " we are calling for greater transparency -lrb- to create -rrb- better informed markets . " the leaders of europe 's largest economies agreed to remove the " transparency deficit " in the international finance and banking system in the wake of recent market turmoil prompted by the global credit crisis . the european leaders , joined by european commission president jose manuel barroso , pledged to an " open global economy " to weather storms on financial markets , which have been complicated by banking crises in france and britain . uncertainty in financial markets - which triggered an emergency .75 point interest rate cut by the us federal reserve last week - has been compounded by a rogue trader scandal at france 's societe generale bank and the near collapse of britain 's northern rock mortgage lender . transparency the first step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders ' did their best to bring calm to financial markets " at this time of global uncertainty we need to signal our commitment to an open global economy , " brown added , reading from the joint statement .
" prompt and coordinated action has helped to ease the immediate problems , though there is no room for complacency . " the politicians said greater transparency should be accompanied by an " early warning system " to point to future risks as well as a greater exchange of information within the eu and at the international level . french president nicolas sarkozy said the group agreed that transparent markets , not protectionism , would be most beneficial to the eu .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .

" airlines are going to give the police personal data of people who have never been under suspicion , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a speech to the european police congress in berlin on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime . " we have to rely on the resources of human beings , but technology can give us a big advantage , " he said . data collection based on us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data from the system will be stored for upto 15 years the proposals , which would require european air travelers to surrender 19 categories of data about themselves , including e-mail addresses , telephone numbers and credit card details , were backed by interior ministers from eu countries including germany last week as part of new anti-terror measures . the european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- plan is based on a similar system the eu agreed with the united states last year which comes into operation early next year .
just as in the us scheme , the information supplied would be kept for 15 years and would be shared with law enforcement agencies . such a register allowing for long-term retention and access to personal data " is incompatible with the german constitution , " zypries told the congress .

" airlines are going to give the police personal data of people who have never been under suspicion , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a speech to the european police congress in berlin on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime . " we have to rely on the resources of human beings , but technology can give us a big advantage , " he said . data collection based on us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data from the system will be stored for upto 15 years the proposals , which would require european air travelers to surrender 19 categories of data about themselves , including e-mail addresses , telephone numbers and credit card details , were backed by interior ministers from eu countries including germany last week as part of new anti-terror measures . the european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- plan is based on a similar system the eu agreed with the united states last year which comes into operation early next year .
just as in the us scheme , the information supplied would be kept for 15 years and would be shared with law enforcement agencies . such a register allowing for long-term retention and access to personal data " is incompatible with the german constitution , " zypries told the congress .
" i worry that this will be a further step towards a preventionist state , that is already monitoring and policing citizens without prior cause . " frattini promised that access to the stored data would be restricted and that no sensitive information about political or religious beliefs would be divulged . schäuble reiterates support for plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , has taken a different stance to schäuble the proposed european system would affect both eu citizens and foreigners when they enter the bloc , but it would provide a new layer of controls on non-europeans , who would also give information via their visas and an entry-exit register being planned . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble played down zypries ' opposition and said he expected the passenger data plan to be approved in berlin . " the commission 's proposal is very similar to the agreement between the eu and the united states , and that was signed off by the lower and upper houses of the german parliament , " he said at the meeting of european police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .
then we will all throw away our cigarettes and live happily ever after . - karen freed , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 29.01.2008 nokia plant closure draws germany 's attention to bochum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterness at plant closure in bochum has drawn thousands of visitors in show of support bochum is a city that has become a prototype for the transformation of the ruhr region from smokestack industries to high tech .
now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .
they , however , did not set a date for a second meeting . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .
they , however , did not set a date for a second meeting . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" societe generale is in a crisis situation , " french economy minister christine lagarde told lci television on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" in a difficult moment , the board members are there to decide if the person in charge is the best placed to run the ship when it is pitching , or whether they should change the captain . " french president nicolas sarkozy on monday evening had explicitly called for the resignation of societe generale ceo daniel bouton . " when you have a fat salary , no doubt entirely legitimate , and then a problem crops up , you can not wash your hands of responsibility , " the president said . bouton had submitted his resignation last week after the news became public thursday that employee jerome kerviel had lost the bank 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.22 billion -rrb- in an unauthorized and highly speculative stock deal .
however , the board rejected his resignation and asked him to stay on . rogue trader not charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's largest bank could take over societe generale kerviel , a 31-year-old junior trader at societe general , was freed from jail late monday , pending further investigation , after judges decided against charging him with fraud .
he has been accused of forgery and using forged documents , computer abuse and breach of trust , which could lead to up to three years in prison and hefty fines if he is convicted . prosecutor said they would appeal kerviel 's release . public prosecutor jean-claude marin told journalists monday that kerviel had admitted that his fictitious trading had begun in 2005 - a year earlier than the bank 's version - but that the trader had said other employees were involved in the same types of deals . " he wanted to be seen as an exceptional trader , an astute market player , " said marin , adding that kerviel was attracted by the possibility of earning a 300,000-euro bonus . the junior trader allegedly ran up positions worth 50 billion euros on futures tied to three european share indices but did n't protect them as he 'd promised , instead leaving them exposed to high risk . take-over considered likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo bouton 's first resignation was rejected by the board the head of the investment department that employed kerviel , jean-pierre mustier , would have been bouton 's likely successor as chief executive officer .
however , his standing has also been damaged by the scandal , posing the question of who will take over the bank . reeling from the us subprime crisis that shook up the global financial sector , societe generale 's stock had dropped nearly 30 percent since the beginning of this year . kerviel 's lawyers have accused the bank of using the rogue trading scandal as a " smokescreen " to cover up wider losses caused by the us crisis . experts have speculated that the bank may become the subject of a take-over , with france 's biggest listed bank , bnp paribas , named as a likely candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a difficult moment , the board members are there to decide if the person in charge is the best placed to run the ship when it is pitching , or whether they should change the captain . " french president nicolas sarkozy on monday evening had explicitly called for the resignation of societe generale ceo daniel bouton . " when you have a fat salary , no doubt entirely legitimate , and then a problem crops up , you can not wash your hands of responsibility , " the president said . bouton had submitted his resignation last week after the news became public thursday that employee jerome kerviel had lost the bank 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.22 billion -rrb- in an unauthorized and highly speculative stock deal .
however , the board rejected his resignation and asked him to stay on . rogue trader not charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's largest bank could take over societe generale kerviel , a 31-year-old junior trader at societe general , was freed from jail late monday , pending further investigation , after judges decided against charging him with fraud .
he has been accused of forgery and using forged documents , computer abuse and breach of trust , which could lead to up to three years in prison and hefty fines if he is convicted . prosecutor said they would appeal kerviel 's release . public prosecutor jean-claude marin told journalists monday that kerviel had admitted that his fictitious trading had begun in 2005 - a year earlier than the bank 's version - but that the trader had said other employees were involved in the same types of deals . " he wanted to be seen as an exceptional trader , an astute market player , " said marin , adding that kerviel was attracted by the possibility of earning a 300,000-euro bonus . the junior trader allegedly ran up positions worth 50 billion euros on futures tied to three european share indices but did n't protect them as he 'd promised , instead leaving them exposed to high risk . take-over considered likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo bouton 's first resignation was rejected by the board the head of the investment department that employed kerviel , jean-pierre mustier , would have been bouton 's likely successor as chief executive officer .
however , his standing has also been damaged by the scandal , posing the question of who will take over the bank . reeling from the us subprime crisis that shook up the global financial sector , societe generale 's stock had dropped nearly 30 percent since the beginning of this year . kerviel 's lawyers have accused the bank of using the rogue trading scandal as a " smokescreen " to cover up wider losses caused by the us crisis . experts have speculated that the bank may become the subject of a take-over , with france 's biggest listed bank , bnp paribas , named as a likely candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . the official request from nato will prompt heightened concern from within germany that its current non-combat role in afghanistan is changing and that german troops will soon be required to fight taliban and al qaeda insurgents in the war-torn country as part of the alliance 's international security and assistance force . despite the assurances of defense minister franz josef jung who said during a surprise visit to kabul tuesday that a final decision had yet to be taken , government ministers and generals have indicated over recent days that the force is all but certain to be deployed , insisting that it is covered by the current mandate for the afghan deployment , renewed by parliament in october . german troops ready for " operations against terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung told karzai that german troops were ready in a statement released from afghan president hamid karzai 's office , jung was quoted as saying that german troops were ready to " participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country , " suggesting a decision to ready german troops for combat had already been made . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief includes hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this is not its main task . as the current head of nato 's mission in northern afghanistan , german military officials last week said they anticipated having to provide replacements for the norwegian troops if none of the alliance 's members volunteered to take over . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates . up to 3,000 bundeswehr troops are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in the relatively peaceful north under the nato-led international security assistance force .
there are also six german tornado reconnaissance jets and their back-up units based in the country . the request from nato comes just days after a radical manifesto for a new nato , compiled by the leading military experts from five member nations - the united states , britain , germany , france and the netherlands - was announced . new nato manifesto to abolish caveats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new strategy could radically change its missions the manifesto stated that , among other wholesale changes , the organization would abolish the current system of national caveats in its operations of the kind that plague the afghan campaign . this would mean that countries like germany , which contribute to security and reconstruction missions but opt out of combat operations by way of such a caveat , would be either obliged to commit militarily to enemy engagements or forfeit any say in the running of operations led by nato . the manifesto , revealed last week , and other measures outlined in a " root and branch " review of the organization as it faces new global challenges is to be discussed at the nato summit in bucharest in april . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . the official request from nato will prompt heightened concern from within germany that its current non-combat role in afghanistan is changing and that german troops will soon be required to fight taliban and al qaeda insurgents in the war-torn country as part of the alliance 's international security and assistance force . despite the assurances of defense minister franz josef jung who said during a surprise visit to kabul tuesday that a final decision had yet to be taken , government ministers and generals have indicated over recent days that the force is all but certain to be deployed , insisting that it is covered by the current mandate for the afghan deployment , renewed by parliament in october . german troops ready for " operations against terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung told karzai that german troops were ready in a statement released from afghan president hamid karzai 's office , jung was quoted as saying that german troops were ready to " participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country , " suggesting a decision to ready german troops for combat had already been made . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief includes hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this is not its main task . as the current head of nato 's mission in northern afghanistan , german military officials last week said they anticipated having to provide replacements for the norwegian troops if none of the alliance 's members volunteered to take over . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates . up to 3,000 bundeswehr troops are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in the relatively peaceful north under the nato-led international security assistance force .
there are also six german tornado reconnaissance jets and their back-up units based in the country . the request from nato comes just days after a radical manifesto for a new nato , compiled by the leading military experts from five member nations - the united states , britain , germany , france and the netherlands - was announced . new nato manifesto to abolish caveats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new strategy could radically change its missions the manifesto stated that , among other wholesale changes , the organization would abolish the current system of national caveats in its operations of the kind that plague the afghan campaign . this would mean that countries like germany , which contribute to security and reconstruction missions but opt out of combat operations by way of such a caveat , would be either obliged to commit militarily to enemy engagements or forfeit any say in the running of operations led by nato . the manifesto , revealed last week , and other measures outlined in a " root and branch " review of the organization as it faces new global challenges is to be discussed at the nato summit in bucharest in april . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .

29 . the official request from nato will prompt heightened concern from within germany that its current non-combat role in afghanistan is changing and that german troops will soon be required to fight taliban and al qaeda insurgents in the war-torn country as part of the alliance 's international security and assistance force . despite the assurances of defense minister franz josef jung who said during a surprise visit to kabul tuesday that a final decision had yet to be taken , government ministers and generals have indicated over recent days that the force is all but certain to be deployed , insisting that it is covered by the current mandate for the afghan deployment , renewed by parliament in october . german troops ready for " operations against terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung told karzai that german troops were ready in a statement released from afghan president hamid karzai 's office , jung was quoted as saying that german troops were ready to " participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country , " suggesting a decision to ready german troops for combat had already been made . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief includes hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this is not its main task . as the current head of nato 's mission in northern afghanistan , german military officials last week said they anticipated having to provide replacements for the norwegian troops if none of the alliance 's members volunteered to take over . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates . up to 3,000 bundeswehr troops are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in the relatively peaceful north under the nato-led international security assistance force .
there are also six german tornado reconnaissance jets and their back-up units based in the country . the request from nato comes just days after a radical manifesto for a new nato , compiled by the leading military experts from five member nations - the united states , britain , germany , france and the netherlands - was announced . new nato manifesto to abolish caveats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new strategy could radically change its missions the manifesto stated that , among other wholesale changes , the organization would abolish the current system of national caveats in its operations of the kind that plague the afghan campaign . this would mean that countries like germany , which contribute to security and reconstruction missions but opt out of combat operations by way of such a caveat , would be either obliged to commit militarily to enemy engagements or forfeit any say in the running of operations led by nato . the manifesto , revealed last week , and other measures outlined in a " root and branch " review of the organization as it faces new global challenges is to be discussed at the nato summit in bucharest in april . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .
then we will all throw away our cigarettes and live happily ever after . - karen freed , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges .

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production .

nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 29.01.2008 nokia plant closure draws germany 's attention to bochum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterness at plant closure in bochum has drawn thousands of visitors in show of support bochum is a city that has become a prototype for the transformation of the ruhr region from smokestack industries to high tech .
now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .

burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when you have a fat salary , no doubt entirely legitimate , and then a problem crops up , you can not wash your hands of responsibility , " the president said . bouton had submitted his resignation last week after the news became public thursday that employee jerome kerviel had lost the bank 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.22 billion -rrb- in an unauthorized and highly speculative stock deal .

he has been accused of forgery and using forged documents , computer abuse and breach of trust , which could lead to up to three years in prison and hefty fines if he is convicted . prosecutor said they would appeal kerviel 's release . public prosecutor jean-claude marin told journalists monday that kerviel had admitted that his fictitious trading had begun in 2005 - a year earlier than the bank 's version - but that the trader had said other employees were involved in the same types of deals . " he wanted to be seen as an exceptional trader , an astute market player , " said marin , adding that kerviel was attracted by the possibility of earning a 300,000-euro bonus . the junior trader allegedly ran up positions worth 50 billion euros on futures tied to three european share indices but did n't protect them as he 'd promised , instead leaving them exposed to high risk . take-over considered likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo bouton 's first resignation was rejected by the board the head of the investment department that employed kerviel , jean-pierre mustier , would have been bouton 's likely successor as chief executive officer .
however , his standing has also been damaged by the scandal , posing the question of who will take over the bank . reeling from the us subprime crisis that shook up the global financial sector , societe generale 's stock had dropped nearly 30 percent since the beginning of this year . kerviel 's lawyers have accused the bank of using the rogue trading scandal as a " smokescreen " to cover up wider losses caused by the us crisis . experts have speculated that the bank may become the subject of a take-over , with france 's biggest listed bank , bnp paribas , named as a likely candidate .

" airlines are going to give the police personal data of people who have never been under suspicion , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a speech to the european police congress in berlin on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime . " we have to rely on the resources of human beings , but technology can give us a big advantage , " he said . data collection based on us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data from the system will be stored for upto 15 years the proposals , which would require european air travelers to surrender 19 categories of data about themselves , including e-mail addresses , telephone numbers and credit card details , were backed by interior ministers from eu countries including germany last week as part of new anti-terror measures . the european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- plan is based on a similar system the eu agreed with the united states last year which comes into operation early next year .
just as in the us scheme , the information supplied would be kept for 15 years and would be shared with law enforcement agencies . such a register allowing for long-term retention and access to personal data " is incompatible with the german constitution , " zypries told the congress .
" i worry that this will be a further step towards a preventionist state , that is already monitoring and policing citizens without prior cause . " frattini promised that access to the stored data would be restricted and that no sensitive information about political or religious beliefs would be divulged . schäuble reiterates support for plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , has taken a different stance to schäuble the proposed european system would affect both eu citizens and foreigners when they enter the bloc , but it would provide a new layer of controls on non-europeans , who would also give information via their visas and an entry-exit register being planned . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble played down zypries ' opposition and said he expected the passenger data plan to be approved in berlin . " the commission 's proposal is very similar to the agreement between the eu and the united states , and that was signed off by the lower and upper houses of the german parliament , " he said at the meeting of european police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .
then we will all throw away our cigarettes and live happily ever after . - karen freed , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .
then we will all throw away our cigarettes and live happily ever after . - karen freed , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges .

burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 29.01.2008 nokia plant closure draws germany 's attention to bochum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterness at plant closure in bochum has drawn thousands of visitors in show of support bochum is a city that has become a prototype for the transformation of the ruhr region from smokestack industries to high tech .
now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .

then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production .

general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .

" societe generale is in a crisis situation , " french economy minister christine lagarde told lci television on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" in a difficult moment , the board members are there to decide if the person in charge is the best placed to run the ship when it is pitching , or whether they should change the captain . " french president nicolas sarkozy on monday evening had explicitly called for the resignation of societe generale ceo daniel bouton . " when you have a fat salary , no doubt entirely legitimate , and then a problem crops up , you can not wash your hands of responsibility , " the president said . bouton had submitted his resignation last week after the news became public thursday that employee jerome kerviel had lost the bank 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.22 billion -rrb- in an unauthorized and highly speculative stock deal .
however , the board rejected his resignation and asked him to stay on . rogue trader not charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's largest bank could take over societe generale kerviel , a 31-year-old junior trader at societe general , was freed from jail late monday , pending further investigation , after judges decided against charging him with fraud .
he has been accused of forgery and using forged documents , computer abuse and breach of trust , which could lead to up to three years in prison and hefty fines if he is convicted . prosecutor said they would appeal kerviel 's release . public prosecutor jean-claude marin told journalists monday that kerviel had admitted that his fictitious trading had begun in 2005 - a year earlier than the bank 's version - but that the trader had said other employees were involved in the same types of deals . " he wanted to be seen as an exceptional trader , an astute market player , " said marin , adding that kerviel was attracted by the possibility of earning a 300,000-euro bonus . the junior trader allegedly ran up positions worth 50 billion euros on futures tied to three european share indices but did n't protect them as he 'd promised , instead leaving them exposed to high risk . take-over considered likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo bouton 's first resignation was rejected by the board the head of the investment department that employed kerviel , jean-pierre mustier , would have been bouton 's likely successor as chief executive officer .
however , his standing has also been damaged by the scandal , posing the question of who will take over the bank . reeling from the us subprime crisis that shook up the global financial sector , societe generale 's stock had dropped nearly 30 percent since the beginning of this year . kerviel 's lawyers have accused the bank of using the rogue trading scandal as a " smokescreen " to cover up wider losses caused by the us crisis . experts have speculated that the bank may become the subject of a take-over , with france 's biggest listed bank , bnp paribas , named as a likely candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that tampering would have been possible on the voting machines used in eight different townships in hesse on sunday . the ccc 's constanze kurz said that people could have had unauthorized access to the computers .
furthermore , the club said the voting computers were stored in private apartments of party members in the township of niedernhausen the night before the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top election candidates koch -lrb- l -rrb- and ypsilanti " storing voting computers in the homes of local politicians overnight is a nightmare scenario , even for hesse 's interior ministry , " ccc 's spokesman dirk engling told focus newsmagazine .
" we could n't even have imagined such a thing , " he added . the club also said two of its experts had been left alone with computers for a substantial length of time at two different polling stations . " actions inappropriate " state election supervisor wolfgang hannappel confirmed that " the possibility of manipulation existed theoretically , " but also said there " was no indication that something like that has happened in germany . " the election results in the eight townships in question also corresponded with the general results for the entire state , he added . local election officials had taken the computers home on saturday in order to be able to deliver them directly to polling stations on sunday , hannappel said .
to place emphasis on the party membership of the officials would be to " steer the issue in the wrong direction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer experts say that digital votes can not be recounted like paper ones what the officials had done , however , was not appropriate , and it was " a case of a formal breach , " he added .
furthermore , in response to the claim that ccc observers were left alone with computers already delivered to two polling stations before election directors arrived , he said that " someone should normally be present " when the computers ' arrive . still , hannappel said he did not anticipate the votes to be repeated .
hesse 's election examination office was investigating the validity of the state election irrespective of the accusations of manipulation feasibility , he added .
official results left the christian democrats and the social democrats only one-tenth of a percent apart . some older voters had difficulties according to focus , 50 people had also observed that a majority of older voters had problems using the voting machines .
the magazine reported that helpers at the polling stations were forced to offer senior citizens their aid . hannappel defended the use of computers : " as long as voters are not severely visually impaired - which is also a hurdle when voting on paper - there 's no problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime .

" airlines are going to give the police personal data of people who have never been under suspicion , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a speech to the european police congress in berlin on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime . " we have to rely on the resources of human beings , but technology can give us a big advantage , " he said . data collection based on us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data from the system will be stored for upto 15 years the proposals , which would require european air travelers to surrender 19 categories of data about themselves , including e-mail addresses , telephone numbers and credit card details , were backed by interior ministers from eu countries including germany last week as part of new anti-terror measures . the european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- plan is based on a similar system the eu agreed with the united states last year which comes into operation early next year .
just as in the us scheme , the information supplied would be kept for 15 years and would be shared with law enforcement agencies . such a register allowing for long-term retention and access to personal data " is incompatible with the german constitution , " zypries told the congress .
" i worry that this will be a further step towards a preventionist state , that is already monitoring and policing citizens without prior cause . " frattini promised that access to the stored data would be restricted and that no sensitive information about political or religious beliefs would be divulged . schäuble reiterates support for plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , has taken a different stance to schäuble the proposed european system would affect both eu citizens and foreigners when they enter the bloc , but it would provide a new layer of controls on non-europeans , who would also give information via their visas and an entry-exit register being planned . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble played down zypries ' opposition and said he expected the passenger data plan to be approved in berlin . " the commission 's proposal is very similar to the agreement between the eu and the united states , and that was signed off by the lower and upper houses of the german parliament , " he said at the meeting of european police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" societe generale is in a crisis situation , " french economy minister christine lagarde told lci television on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" in a difficult moment , the board members are there to decide if the person in charge is the best placed to run the ship when it is pitching , or whether they should change the captain . " french president nicolas sarkozy on monday evening had explicitly called for the resignation of societe generale ceo daniel bouton . " when you have a fat salary , no doubt entirely legitimate , and then a problem crops up , you can not wash your hands of responsibility , " the president said . bouton had submitted his resignation last week after the news became public thursday that employee jerome kerviel had lost the bank 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.22 billion -rrb- in an unauthorized and highly speculative stock deal .
however , the board rejected his resignation and asked him to stay on . rogue trader not charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's largest bank could take over societe generale kerviel , a 31-year-old junior trader at societe general , was freed from jail late monday , pending further investigation , after judges decided against charging him with fraud .
he has been accused of forgery and using forged documents , computer abuse and breach of trust , which could lead to up to three years in prison and hefty fines if he is convicted . prosecutor said they would appeal kerviel 's release . public prosecutor jean-claude marin told journalists monday that kerviel had admitted that his fictitious trading had begun in 2005 - a year earlier than the bank 's version - but that the trader had said other employees were involved in the same types of deals . " he wanted to be seen as an exceptional trader , an astute market player , " said marin , adding that kerviel was attracted by the possibility of earning a 300,000-euro bonus . the junior trader allegedly ran up positions worth 50 billion euros on futures tied to three european share indices but did n't protect them as he 'd promised , instead leaving them exposed to high risk . take-over considered likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo bouton 's first resignation was rejected by the board the head of the investment department that employed kerviel , jean-pierre mustier , would have been bouton 's likely successor as chief executive officer .
however , his standing has also been damaged by the scandal , posing the question of who will take over the bank . reeling from the us subprime crisis that shook up the global financial sector , societe generale 's stock had dropped nearly 30 percent since the beginning of this year . kerviel 's lawyers have accused the bank of using the rogue trading scandal as a " smokescreen " to cover up wider losses caused by the us crisis . experts have speculated that the bank may become the subject of a take-over , with france 's biggest listed bank , bnp paribas , named as a likely candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .
they , however , did not set a date for a second meeting . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .

we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .
then we will all throw away our cigarettes and live happily ever after . - karen freed , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges .

burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . the official request from nato will prompt heightened concern from within germany that its current non-combat role in afghanistan is changing and that german troops will soon be required to fight taliban and al qaeda insurgents in the war-torn country as part of the alliance 's international security and assistance force . despite the assurances of defense minister franz josef jung who said during a surprise visit to kabul tuesday that a final decision had yet to be taken , government ministers and generals have indicated over recent days that the force is all but certain to be deployed , insisting that it is covered by the current mandate for the afghan deployment , renewed by parliament in october . german troops ready for " operations against terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung told karzai that german troops were ready in a statement released from afghan president hamid karzai 's office , jung was quoted as saying that german troops were ready to " participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country , " suggesting a decision to ready german troops for combat had already been made . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief includes hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this is not its main task . as the current head of nato 's mission in northern afghanistan , german military officials last week said they anticipated having to provide replacements for the norwegian troops if none of the alliance 's members volunteered to take over . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates . up to 3,000 bundeswehr troops are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in the relatively peaceful north under the nato-led international security assistance force .
there are also six german tornado reconnaissance jets and their back-up units based in the country . the request from nato comes just days after a radical manifesto for a new nato , compiled by the leading military experts from five member nations - the united states , britain , germany , france and the netherlands - was announced . new nato manifesto to abolish caveats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new strategy could radically change its missions the manifesto stated that , among other wholesale changes , the organization would abolish the current system of national caveats in its operations of the kind that plague the afghan campaign . this would mean that countries like germany , which contribute to security and reconstruction missions but opt out of combat operations by way of such a caveat , would be either obliged to commit militarily to enemy engagements or forfeit any say in the running of operations led by nato . the manifesto , revealed last week , and other measures outlined in a " root and branch " review of the organization as it faces new global challenges is to be discussed at the nato summit in bucharest in april . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" societe generale is in a crisis situation , " french economy minister christine lagarde told lci television on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" in a difficult moment , the board members are there to decide if the person in charge is the best placed to run the ship when it is pitching , or whether they should change the captain . " french president nicolas sarkozy on monday evening had explicitly called for the resignation of societe generale ceo daniel bouton . " when you have a fat salary , no doubt entirely legitimate , and then a problem crops up , you can not wash your hands of responsibility , " the president said . bouton had submitted his resignation last week after the news became public thursday that employee jerome kerviel had lost the bank 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.22 billion -rrb- in an unauthorized and highly speculative stock deal .
however , the board rejected his resignation and asked him to stay on . rogue trader not charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's largest bank could take over societe generale kerviel , a 31-year-old junior trader at societe general , was freed from jail late monday , pending further investigation , after judges decided against charging him with fraud .
he has been accused of forgery and using forged documents , computer abuse and breach of trust , which could lead to up to three years in prison and hefty fines if he is convicted . prosecutor said they would appeal kerviel 's release . public prosecutor jean-claude marin told journalists monday that kerviel had admitted that his fictitious trading had begun in 2005 - a year earlier than the bank 's version - but that the trader had said other employees were involved in the same types of deals . " he wanted to be seen as an exceptional trader , an astute market player , " said marin , adding that kerviel was attracted by the possibility of earning a 300,000-euro bonus . the junior trader allegedly ran up positions worth 50 billion euros on futures tied to three european share indices but did n't protect them as he 'd promised , instead leaving them exposed to high risk . take-over considered likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo bouton 's first resignation was rejected by the board the head of the investment department that employed kerviel , jean-pierre mustier , would have been bouton 's likely successor as chief executive officer .
however , his standing has also been damaged by the scandal , posing the question of who will take over the bank . reeling from the us subprime crisis that shook up the global financial sector , societe generale 's stock had dropped nearly 30 percent since the beginning of this year . kerviel 's lawyers have accused the bank of using the rogue trading scandal as a " smokescreen " to cover up wider losses caused by the us crisis . experts have speculated that the bank may become the subject of a take-over , with france 's biggest listed bank , bnp paribas , named as a likely candidate .

" airlines are going to give the police personal data of people who have never been under suspicion , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said in a speech to the european police congress in berlin on tuesday , jan .
29 .
" why is there a need to collect the data of all passengers when the data of suspects is already known to the police ? " zypries added that the eu commission 's plan was a misguided attempt to replace human intuition with technology in the fight against crime and she questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime . european justice commissioner franco frattini , a strong supporter of the plan , responded by saying that technology could play a crucial role in combating terrorism and organized crime . " we have to rely on the resources of human beings , but technology can give us a big advantage , " he said . data collection based on us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data from the system will be stored for upto 15 years the proposals , which would require european air travelers to surrender 19 categories of data about themselves , including e-mail addresses , telephone numbers and credit card details , were backed by interior ministers from eu countries including germany last week as part of new anti-terror measures . the european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- plan is based on a similar system the eu agreed with the united states last year which comes into operation early next year .
just as in the us scheme , the information supplied would be kept for 15 years and would be shared with law enforcement agencies . such a register allowing for long-term retention and access to personal data " is incompatible with the german constitution , " zypries told the congress .
" i worry that this will be a further step towards a preventionist state , that is already monitoring and policing citizens without prior cause . " frattini promised that access to the stored data would be restricted and that no sensitive information about political or religious beliefs would be divulged . schäuble reiterates support for plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , has taken a different stance to schäuble the proposed european system would affect both eu citizens and foreigners when they enter the bloc , but it would provide a new layer of controls on non-europeans , who would also give information via their visas and an entry-exit register being planned . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble played down zypries ' opposition and said he expected the passenger data plan to be approved in berlin . " the commission 's proposal is very similar to the agreement between the eu and the united states , and that was signed off by the lower and upper houses of the german parliament , " he said at the meeting of european police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 29.01.2008 nokia plant closure draws germany 's attention to bochum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterness at plant closure in bochum has drawn thousands of visitors in show of support bochum is a city that has become a prototype for the transformation of the ruhr region from smokestack industries to high tech .
now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 29.01.2008 nokia plant closure draws germany 's attention to bochum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterness at plant closure in bochum has drawn thousands of visitors in show of support bochum is a city that has become a prototype for the transformation of the ruhr region from smokestack industries to high tech .
now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .

now the blue-collar city has come to represent the downside of globalization in germany . bochum is a drab , nondescript city in the industrial heartland of the ruhr valley . it is home to german pop icon herbert grönemeyer , whose 1984 breakthrough album was named for the city , and a purpose-built stage for the " starlight express " musical extravaganza performed on in-line skates . but these days it 's not rock concerts or even the city 's first-division soccer team that is persuading tens of thousands of people to head to the blue-collar workingman 's town .
they 're making the journey to protest nokia 's decision to shut down an assembly plant in the grotty , run-down riemke district . today 's visitors also protesters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's " starlight express " has seen 12 million visitors since opening in 1988 in mid-january , the finnish management of the world 's leading mobile phone maker announced its decision to close the bochum production facility by mid-2008 .
the announcement came out of the blue for nokia 's 2,300 staff and over 1,000 part-time workers . at the gated entrance of the nokia industrial park , a white sheet with the company logo - " connecting people " - expresses employees ' feelings .
the word " connecting " is crossed out and replaced with the word " betraying " in blood red - symbolic red for dracula , the vampire from transylvania , a part of romania , where labor costs are one-tenth of germany 's and where nokia is moving part of bochum 's production . " did you see today 's headlines ?
nokia says we can move to romania if we want to keep our jobs , " said harry abich , a maintenance technician .
like many of his colleagues , abich got word about the plant closure from television reports and greeted the news with disbelief . " nokianers " and " opelaners " in show of solidarity some nokia workers were holding a candlelight vigil at a solidarity tent outside of headquarters .
they call themselves " nokianers " at a company where collegiality is the norm and workers address each other on a first name basis , which is unusual for german companies . the nokianers were joined in protest by " opelaners " or opel autoworkers , who were in the same boat more than three years ago .
general motors , which owns opel , had then announced deep job cuts at its assembly plant in bochum .
after massive protests , wildcat strikes and political wrangling , the plant and some jobs were saved , but lay-offs were inevitable , given opel 's financial losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and political wrangling had saved some jobs at gm 's opel plant in 2004 " there 's a big difference between opel and nokia , " said heinz-martin dirks , head of economic development for the city of bochum .
" opel was in the red .
nokia is deep in the black and reported record profits - 7.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in 2007 . what nokia is doing is not very humane , to say the least . " dirks called the job losses a shock for bochum , but explained that the city has learned from the past to stand on its own two feet without becoming too dependent on a single industry . even the loss of some 25 million euros in annual tax revenues that nokia pays the city will be made up in part by regional compensatory funds from the state of north rhine-westphalia , said dirks . from coal to steel to high-tech industry bochum , like other cities in the densely populated ruhr valley , has gone through structural transformations twice before in its postwar history .
the coal mining pits that had fuelled germany 's wirtschaftswunder , the country 's economic miracle in the 1950s , went into steep decline in the 1960s , and were supplanted by the steel and automobile manufacturing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry fueled germany 's economic miracle , but went into steep decline in the 1960s then in 1965 , the ruhr university became the first postwar university to be established in germany and not only created jobs , but brought a new intellectual community to the city , along with a healthy demand for cultural offerings , such as the schauspielhaus theater and the city orchestra . by the end of the 1980s , the number of opel workers employed started declining from a peak of 20,000 to roughly 6,000 today .
then nokia arrived in 1988 with more than 80 million euros in state and federal subsidies to replace losses in heavy industry , signaling a shift into the service and high-tech sector . nokia and globalization 's downside " opel was a blessing for bochum , and became a symbol of hope - those displaced coal workers went to opel , " said frank goosen , a cabaret performer and novelist , who is one of the city 's best known native sons .
" nokia on the other hand has become a symbol about all that is bad about globalization . " " coal-mining was n't profitable anymore , neither was opel .
but nokia is making huge profits , and they 're off to romania now , so that their profit margins can be even bigger , " said goosen , who has joined his compatriots in either disposing of or replacing their nokia phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia said germany 's high labor costs are behind the move from bochum to romania late last week , over 56,000 people voiced their opinion on a web site about the plant 's closing and whether it affected their decision to buy the nokia brand .
a whopping 69 percent responded with a " yes . " germany is the world 's third largest export market for nokia and the bitterness is palpable .
there is even a box at the schauspielhaus where people can dump their nokia phones to be shipped to finland with the curt message " nokia must stay in bochum . " at a meeting on monday , jan .
28 , nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo , german union officials and politicians said they wanted to find " innovative solutions " for the bochum employees to find work .
they , however , did not set a date for a second meeting . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . the official request from nato will prompt heightened concern from within germany that its current non-combat role in afghanistan is changing and that german troops will soon be required to fight taliban and al qaeda insurgents in the war-torn country as part of the alliance 's international security and assistance force . despite the assurances of defense minister franz josef jung who said during a surprise visit to kabul tuesday that a final decision had yet to be taken , government ministers and generals have indicated over recent days that the force is all but certain to be deployed , insisting that it is covered by the current mandate for the afghan deployment , renewed by parliament in october . german troops ready for " operations against terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung told karzai that german troops were ready in a statement released from afghan president hamid karzai 's office , jung was quoted as saying that german troops were ready to " participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country , " suggesting a decision to ready german troops for combat had already been made . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief includes hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this is not its main task . as the current head of nato 's mission in northern afghanistan , german military officials last week said they anticipated having to provide replacements for the norwegian troops if none of the alliance 's members volunteered to take over . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates . up to 3,000 bundeswehr troops are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in the relatively peaceful north under the nato-led international security assistance force .
there are also six german tornado reconnaissance jets and their back-up units based in the country . the request from nato comes just days after a radical manifesto for a new nato , compiled by the leading military experts from five member nations - the united states , britain , germany , france and the netherlands - was announced . new nato manifesto to abolish caveats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new strategy could radically change its missions the manifesto stated that , among other wholesale changes , the organization would abolish the current system of national caveats in its operations of the kind that plague the afghan campaign . this would mean that countries like germany , which contribute to security and reconstruction missions but opt out of combat operations by way of such a caveat , would be either obliged to commit militarily to enemy engagements or forfeit any say in the running of operations led by nato . the manifesto , revealed last week , and other measures outlined in a " root and branch " review of the organization as it faces new global challenges is to be discussed at the nato summit in bucharest in april . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burger said the new bridge would blend in more harmoniously with the elbe river valley landscape . while changes in the original design are possible , " those expecting a miracle , however , will be disappointed , " burger added . vogel said that , for its part , unesco was not interested in being actively involved in the process of redesigning the bridge . mixed views on construction vogel said the bridge 's width would be reduced by one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- to 23.4 meters over the elbe river . the bridge 's pillars , which rest on the river banks , will also be reduced by a meter - or 60 percent - in size by omitting stairs for pedestrians that were part of the original plans .
other features are also supposed to be altered . construction of the four-lane bridge began in november last year amid controversy and protests , particularly by nature conservationists that it would endanger rare horseshoe bats that inhabit the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the bridge began last november while many residents of the city have favored the project because they believe it will ease traffic congestion , others have expressed their concern that the city will lose its world cultural heritage site status - which has been a major draw for thousands of tourists each year . unesco threatened to take dresden off the heritage site list because its committee said the character of the city , dubbed as the " florence of the elbe , " would be compromised .
last june , it also placed the elbe valley - dotted with gardens and palaces - on a list of " endangered sites " that are under risk of losing their status . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 . the official request from nato will prompt heightened concern from within germany that its current non-combat role in afghanistan is changing and that german troops will soon be required to fight taliban and al qaeda insurgents in the war-torn country as part of the alliance 's international security and assistance force . despite the assurances of defense minister franz josef jung who said during a surprise visit to kabul tuesday that a final decision had yet to be taken , government ministers and generals have indicated over recent days that the force is all but certain to be deployed , insisting that it is covered by the current mandate for the afghan deployment , renewed by parliament in october . german troops ready for " operations against terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung told karzai that german troops were ready in a statement released from afghan president hamid karzai 's office , jung was quoted as saying that german troops were ready to " participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country , " suggesting a decision to ready german troops for combat had already been made . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief includes hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this is not its main task . as the current head of nato 's mission in northern afghanistan , german military officials last week said they anticipated having to provide replacements for the norwegian troops if none of the alliance 's members volunteered to take over . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates . up to 3,000 bundeswehr troops are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in the relatively peaceful north under the nato-led international security assistance force .
there are also six german tornado reconnaissance jets and their back-up units based in the country . the request from nato comes just days after a radical manifesto for a new nato , compiled by the leading military experts from five member nations - the united states , britain , germany , france and the netherlands - was announced . new nato manifesto to abolish caveats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new strategy could radically change its missions the manifesto stated that , among other wholesale changes , the organization would abolish the current system of national caveats in its operations of the kind that plague the afghan campaign . this would mean that countries like germany , which contribute to security and reconstruction missions but opt out of combat operations by way of such a caveat , would be either obliged to commit militarily to enemy engagements or forfeit any say in the running of operations led by nato . the manifesto , revealed last week , and other measures outlined in a " root and branch " review of the organization as it faces new global challenges is to be discussed at the nato summit in bucharest in april . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.01.2008 german state elections shake up political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party benefitted from cdu candidate roland koch 's loss of credibility , said diederich state elections in lower saxony and hesse have upset the political order , according to analyst nils diederich .
with the new left party and the free democrats now well positioned , can the top two rethink their tactics ? nils diederich is professor emeritus for political science at the freie university in berlin .
his research focus is elections , domestic policy and political systems . dw-world.de : the left party passed the five-percent benchmark in both lower saxony and hesse in elections on sunday , jan .
27 , thus winning seats in the state governments .
how do you interpret the election results ? nils diederich : the election results are an indication that the left party is beginning to establish itself in western germany and is able to mobilize a base of supporters .
whether this is a temporary or a lasting phenomenon is something we wo n't be able to evaluate until the next elections , that is , the federal parliamentary elections -lsb- in 2009 -rsb- . in my opinion , the differences in the election results in lower saxony and hesse show that it 's very difficult to determine which way the wind is blowing for the upcoming bundestag elections .
-lsb- hesse 's incumbent premier roland -rsb- koch showed us that demagogical tactics are n't necessarily successful .
voters in germany clearly seem to be experienced ; they decide on a case-by-case basis and are n't mobilized by slogans meant to inspire fear . on the contrary , mr. koch apparently scared off his own voters .
this is evident in the movement toward the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
i 'm sure that many conservative voters did n't like koch 's style but still wanted to vote conservative and stuck with the fdp in the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's campaign was openly xenophobic did the left party also benefit from mr. koch 's brutal election campaign ? the amazing thing is that the polarization between -lsb- social democratic party candidate andrea -rsb- ypsilanti and koch did n't shift all the votes to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
that means that the left party apparently mobilized its own voters , who were clearly against koch but did n't see the spd as a sufficient alternative .
in this way , the left party did benefit from koch .
it was an even bigger advantage that the spd had lost its credibility among voters , and some of these turned to the left party . the left party is currently represented in nine state parliaments .
will its success continue ? the result is certainly noteworthy for the party landscape - also at the european level - but it should n't be overestimated .
after all , we do n't yet know anything about the stability of its voter base . but in general , it 's quite remarkable that the party spectrum in germany has become even more differentiated . will the election results in hesse and lower saxony have an effect on the state elections in hamburg on feb .
24 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- wo n't repeat koch 's mistakes in hamburg , said diederich i 'm very skeptical about that because the results were very state-specific .
the effects of sunday 's elections have more to do with the question of whether the leaders of the main parties - especially the spd and cdu - will learn something and change their tactics . -lsb- hamburg 's cdu mayor ole -rsb- von beust certainly wo n't make the mistake of taking on a similar tone to mr. koch 's but will probably try a gentler approach aimed at the center , like -lsb- incumbent premier christian -rsb- wulff did -lsb- in lower saxony -rsb- .
that does have an effect on the discourse ; voters are mostly concerned with state issues at the moment . does the left party have a chance at getting into the state parliament in hamburg ? i 'm not really sure .
the voters who say , " i do n't want to vote for a party i do n't think can make it into parliament , " may be encouraged now to vote for the left party .
specifically , some of the spd 's fringe voters could be persuaded to vote deliberately for the left party as a way of expanding the left-wing spectrum in parliament . it 's feasible that the left party will get a boost , especially from the motivation of those supporters who have now realized that it has emerged from the corner of the smallest parties and begun establishing itself in the west .
the result could be mobilization . some of the media have said that koch 's washout in hesse means a defeat for chancellor angela merkel , since she supported his campaign .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel came out on top , at least indirectly that 's a big exaggeration .
merkel was obliged to support koch 's election campaign .
the negative outcome for koch and wulff 's confirmation essentially affirm the chancellor 's line .
she has perhaps come away all the stronger within her own party , contrary to some people 's opinions , since her adopted path has proven to be a winning ticket for future elections , even at the national level . so merkel 's power is n't threatened ? i do n't think she 's in any danger .
both -lsb- the cdu and spd -rsb- have emphasized they want to continue the -lsb- federal ruling -rsb- coalition until the end of the legislative period , but that they will then split up .
sunday 's results mean they have to reorganize and realign . and we ca n't forget the fdp 's result , which was an encouragement for it to do everything it can to establish a cdu-fdp coalition after the next federal elections .
the fpd came away from the last elections stronger and more stable - not like the green party , which did n't lose , but also did n't make any gains . the results serve mainly to re-sort the party landscape or - to use a military expression - to reposition the troops for the next big conflict . interview : christian gies -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media reported this week that former chancellor helmut schmidt was seen smoking in a theater lobby soon after a smoking ban went into effect .
readers disagreed as to whether he should be charged . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course helmut schmidt should be prosecuted for smoking in public .
why should he be allowed to smoke in the public and i 'm not ?
this fact seems to be really unfair and helmut schmidt must accept the fact that smoking in public events is forbidden . - sebastian , germany i do not smoke largely due to the fact that my grandmother died of a smoking-related heart attack back in the 1950 's .
yet to show the other side of the debate , i had a grandfather who started smoking at 12 years of age and continued until he died at the age of 86 .
former chancellor schmidt should probably get a fine to make him think about his choices concerning smoking and health . - stuart john pearson , australia the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate " smoking rooms . " - mike tishler , germany the truth of the matter is that germany is full of public establishments who have chosen to ignore the smoking ban and ordinary german smokers continue to enjoy a puff with a beer .
i have recently visited three bars in the müllheim -lrb- baden -rrb- and titisee-neustadt districts doing just that and no one gives a damn . - wayne shannon , south africa helmut schmidt should not be charged for smoking .
we are all going to absolute extremes with regard to smoking bans .
for a smoker , it feels tantamount to being unjustly imprisoned when really the harm we supposedly cause to the health of others is not as dire as it is purported to be .
if it were so , then we would completely outlaw the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products .
why do n't we go ahead and do that .
then we will all throw away our cigarettes and live happily ever after . - karen freed , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges .

by kim ghattas bbc news , washington mr bush talked about the need to empower the american people bush 's full address george w bush may be seen by many as a lame-duck president , but he tried hard to sound forceful and underline that he is still relevant .
wearing a light blue tie and a dark suit , the president bush sounded comfortable with his speech , but even he admitted there was much unfinished business .
he used the word veto twice , making clear he would use his powers , mainly on tax-related issues .
" members of congress should know : if any bill raising taxes reaches my desk , i will veto it . "
he also warned congress against trying to add anything to the $ 150bn -lrb- £ 76bn -rrb- economy stimulus package , warning that would risk derailing or delaying it .
the package , mostly drawn up by the bush administration , was approved last week after much negotiation and compromise between democratic and republican congressional leaders .
it is hoped it will help stave off a recession , although many say tax cuts are not a long-term fix to the economic woes facing the us .
democratic fire the president attempted to be reassuring and talked about the need to be confident , trust the people with their own money and empower them to help the economy grow .
the best mr bush could offer was a call to individual empowerment - a noble idea , but in mr bush 's hands just another excuse to abdicate government responsibility new york times editorial excerpts : state of the union state of the union reaction however , criticism was quick to come from democratic circles .
presidential hopeful senator barack obama highlighted what he described as a big gap between the sense of urgency that the public felt and the way mr bush spoke , saying people wanted something much more robust than tax cuts .
" we know it was george bush 's washington that let the banks and financial institutions run amok , and take our economy down this dangerous road , " mr obama said .
in an editorial , the new york times wrote that " the nation is splintered over the war in iraq , cleaved by ruthless partisan politics , bubbling with economic fear and mired in debate over virtually all of the issues mr bush faced in 2002 .
" and the best mr bush could offer was a call to individual empowerment - a noble idea , but in mr bush 's hands just another excuse to abdicate government responsibility . "
mr bush made some references to the " last seven years " , mostly in connection to the attacks of 9/11 and events linked to his " freedom agenda " , like the fall of the taleban regime and the pro-democracy demonstrations in lebanon .
but , overall , the speech was more forward-looking than reflective .
lasting legacy ?
although most presidents would use their -lrb- probable -rrb- last state of the union to burnish their legacy , mr bush seemed acutely aware that as the most controversial us president in recent years , it was perhaps best to steer clear even of the word itself .
mrs clinton criticised mr bush for " failure after failure " in iraq he did talk modestly about the successes in iraq and said that the " american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago " .
he insisted that al-qaeda was on the run and that " this enemy will be defeated " , but he made clear that any reduction in us troop numbers would be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendation of military commanders .
he warned that withdrawing too quickly would undermine the recent success .
the response came from hillary clinton , who attended the address in congress - wearing a red power suit and clapping occasionally - before sending out an e-mail to the media .
" president bush is n't satisfied with failure after failure in iraq ; he wants to bind the next president to his failed strategy by unilaterally negotiating with the iraqi government about the future of the us-iraq security relationship , including the possibility of permanent us bases in iraq , " she said .

he said america was a force for hope in the world because " we are a compassionate people " .
he called on congress to double the initial commitment to fighting hiv / aids by approving another $ 30bn over the next five years .
" to this day , mr bush 's compassionate conservatism has never vanished completely -lsb- but he was -rsb- too distracted by war and foreign policy and too bored by the processes of government to know if the people working for him were following through on his proposals , " wrote jacob weisberg , editor of the online political magazine slate , in a washington post op-ed .
" the compassionate conservative will surely pay us a final visit tonight .
he remains an appealing character but a largely fictional one , i wonder how the last seven years might have turned out if he had actually existed .
" in the last year of a failed presidency , i bet mr bush does too . "

although most presidents would use their -lrb- probable -rrb- last state of the union to burnish their legacy , mr bush seemed acutely aware that as the most controversial us president in recent years , it was perhaps best to steer clear even of the word itself .
mrs clinton criticised mr bush for " failure after failure " in iraq he did talk modestly about the successes in iraq and said that the " american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago " .
he insisted that al-qaeda was on the run and that " this enemy will be defeated " , but he made clear that any reduction in us troop numbers would be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendation of military commanders .
he warned that withdrawing too quickly would undermine the recent success .
the response came from hillary clinton , who attended the address in congress - wearing a red power suit and clapping occasionally - before sending out an e-mail to the media .
" president bush is n't satisfied with failure after failure in iraq ; he wants to bind the next president to his failed strategy by unilaterally negotiating with the iraqi government about the future of the us-iraq security relationship , including the possibility of permanent us bases in iraq , " she said .

he said america was a force for hope in the world because " we are a compassionate people " .
he called on congress to double the initial commitment to fighting hiv / aids by approving another $ 30bn over the next five years .
" to this day , mr bush 's compassionate conservatism has never vanished completely -lsb- but he was -rsb- too distracted by war and foreign policy and too bored by the processes of government to know if the people working for him were following through on his proposals , " wrote jacob weisberg , editor of the online political magazine slate , in a washington post op-ed .
" the compassionate conservative will surely pay us a final visit tonight .
he remains an appealing character but a largely fictional one , i wonder how the last seven years might have turned out if he had actually existed .
" in the last year of a failed presidency , i bet mr bush does too . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- fish oil : a cure for young offenders ?

by clare murphy health reporter , bbc news a major trial is to be launched to see whether giving young offenders nutritional supplements reduces anti-social behaviour in prison .
its authors believe this could prove a seminal piece of research with major implications for the criminal justice system .
young offenders , including murderers , in three institutions in the uk are to be given a cocktail of vitamins , minerals and " essential fatty acids " on top of their normal prison diet .
their behaviour will be compared with others who are given a placebo .
researchers , funded by the wellcome trust , have high hopes for the million pound trial on 1,000 volunteers - the largest of its kind - after a much smaller study did find supplements had a favourable impact on levels of violence and ill-discipline in one institution in aylesbury .
this is not about improving prison food , which the team believe is - from a nutritional perspective at least - more than satisfactory .
" the problem is that prisoners do not make good dietary choices , " says professor john stein of oxford university , " and that 's what we 're trying to overcome . "
the idea that better nutrition could change behaviour is obviously an attractive one - providing a pill is both very simple and incredibly cheap .
but it is not without controversy .
something fishy that what we eat can impact upon how we behave is hardly a new concept . "
a society which really believes a young offender can be cured by a capsule which he takes back to his cell and consumes with his chips has got some serious thinking to do " frances crook howard league for penal reform when dr hugh sinclair persuaded the british government in 1942 to supplement children 's diets with orange juice and cod liver oil , he speculated that among other ills , poor diets could lead to anti-social behaviour .
he may not have then predicted the way in which cod liver oil - rich in an essential fatty acid called omega-3 - would be seized from the shelves of health shops and supermarkets by a later generation of parents convinced it would help their child excel at school .
but while there is pretty much consensus within the scientific community about the protective effect these oils have on the heart , their impact upon the brain - whether to lift depression , curb violent urges , or simply to boost concentration - are less well documented .
small trials on selected groups of children with disorders such as dyslexia and adhd have shown mixed results , with small improvements seen in some participants but not others .
fledgling plans to dish it out to all schoolchildren , regardless of disorders , were shelved after the food standards agency said there was little evidence to support such a move .
and a much touted trial of durham schoolchildren , in which all gcse pupils were encouraged to take the supplement in the run up to exams last summer , seems to have been quietly forgotten .
the results did improve , but they have done for the last five years - and the margin of improvement was in fact smaller than previous years .
acting on impulse its impact upon anti-social behaviour takes us into even more uncharted waters . "
it is simple , it seems to be highly effective , and the only ' risk ' from a better diet is better health " bernard gesch natural justice omega-3 is one of the key components of a package of 30 nutrients that will seek to bring the offender 's intake of vitamins and minerals up to the recommended daily amount .
the researchers are looking for evidence that the supplements are helping the participants curb impulsive urges - seen as a key feature of anti-social behaviour .
computer tests will be carried out to measure this .
heart rate variability will also be checked - a low rate is said to be predictive of undesirable behaviour - and blood biochemistry recorded .
while it is thought the fish oil holds the most promise , levels of other important nutrients such as zinc and vitamin d , will also be noted .
the results will then be compared with those of the group offered a placebo .
the researchers hope the findings will mirror , if not better , a study carried out at hm young offenders institution in aylesbury by the charity natural justice , which is also involved in this latest trial .
there capsule takers committed on average 26 % fewer disciplinary offences than those taking a placebo and committed 37 % fewer violent crimes .
what next ?
if the trial does prove a success , it raises as many questions as it answers .
could it be applied to the prison population as a whole - or does it only improve young , growing brains ?
how long will the effects last , and how could you ensure that pill taking continues once the offender has left the prison gate ?
even more controversially , could likely offenders be identified and offered the supplements before undesirable behaviour kicks in ?
frances crook , director of the howard league for penal reform , does believe that diet plays a role in criminal behaviour and that poor food choices should be seen as part of the social fabric from which these youngsters hail .
" but this is all wrong .
what we need is a comprehensive approach : these youngsters need to be taught how to shop , how to cook a nutritious meal and , crucially , how to sit down and eat it with others .
" a society which believes a young offender can be cured by a capsule which he takes back to his cell and consumes with his chips has got some serious thinking to do .
popping a pill can never be the answer . "

by clare murphy health reporter , bbc news a major trial is to be launched to see whether giving young offenders nutritional supplements reduces anti-social behaviour in prison .
its authors believe this could prove a seminal piece of research with major implications for the criminal justice system .
could supplements make him less likely to harm himself or others ?
young offenders , including murderers , in three institutions in the uk are to be given a cocktail of vitamins , minerals and " essential fatty acids " on top of their normal prison diet .
their behaviour will be compared with others who are given a placebo .
researchers , funded by the wellcome trust , have high hopes for the million pound trial on 1,000 volunteers - the largest of its kind - after a much smaller study did find supplements had a favourable impact on levels of violence and ill-discipline in one institution in aylesbury .
this is not about improving prison food , which the team believe is - from a nutritional perspective at least - more than satisfactory .
" the problem is that prisoners do not make good dietary choices , " says professor john stein of oxford university , " and that 's what we 're trying to overcome . "
the idea that better nutrition could change behaviour is obviously an attractive one - providing a pill is both very simple and incredibly cheap .
but it is not without controversy .

by clare murphy health reporter , bbc news a major trial is to be launched to see whether giving young offenders nutritional supplements reduces anti-social behaviour in prison .
its authors believe this could prove a seminal piece of research with major implications for the criminal justice system .
could supplements make him less likely to harm himself or others ?
young offenders , including murderers , in three institutions in the uk are to be given a cocktail of vitamins , minerals and " essential fatty acids " on top of their normal prison diet .
their behaviour will be compared with others who are given a placebo .
researchers , funded by the wellcome trust , have high hopes for the million pound trial on 1,000 volunteers - the largest of its kind - after a much smaller study did find supplements had a favourable impact on levels of violence and ill-discipline in one institution in aylesbury .
this is not about improving prison food , which the team believe is - from a nutritional perspective at least - more than satisfactory .
" the problem is that prisoners do not make good dietary choices , " says professor john stein of oxford university , " and that 's what we 're trying to overcome . "

what is life like for those battling to get help from the state when they most need it ?
peter edwards had to sell his home to help care for his wife yvonne aston needs round-the-clock care .
the 47-year-old has multiple sclerosis and is now confined to a wheelchair .
she also has a degenerative eye condition which means she has lost most of her sight .
if it was not for her husband , peter edwards , she would be in a home .
but her condition has meant that he has had to sell their home and move into council accommodation to help pay for her care .
mr edwards , 61 , from stoke-on-trent , gave up his job as a nurse to look after his wife six years ago .
i am not sure what the answer is , but the basic level of help needs to be increased peter edwards they banked £ 50,000 when the house was sold nearly three years ago , but that has now almost gone and the pair will soon have to rely on the benefits system .
" the level of social care you get is pitiful .
there is something wrong with the system , " he said .
mr edwards said he had to fight for months to get the £ 82.50 his wife receives to pay for the daily two hours of nursing help she gets from monday to friday to allow him to have a break .
battle " it was a battle and it is all the help we get .
the rest of the time it is left to me to look after her .
have your say if more families shared the responsibility between them , it would ease the burden on social care provision michelle willoughby , durham send us your comments " of course , i want to do it and be here for her , but you have to ask whether there should be more support from the state in helping me do this .
" i am not sure what the answer is , but the basic level of help needs to be increased . "
mr edwards said he could see some sense in calls for a system of co-payments whereby the state guarantees a certain level of care and then matches anything the individual is willing to contribute towards his or her care .

after all , this is the age of globalisation .

the millionaires and billionaires attending last week 's world economic forum in davos are just as concerned about their offspring .
can schools prepare children for the globalised world ?
a lunchtime session called " what job should my child take in a globalizing economy ? " was completely booked out , filled with mothers and fathers at a loss of what to do .
however , those hoping for clear answers were quickly disappointed .
" do n't tell your child to be an engineer or be this or that , because we have no clue where future jobs will be , " warned one participant .
" the world is developing so rapidly , whichever job you recommend now will be out-of-date by the time they are out of university , " another chimed in .
and all agreed that the notion of a lifelong job with the same company was obsolete .
still , the discussions at each table of 10 seemed to reach the same conclusions .

" the job of a nurse is more secure than that of a radiologist , " she argued , " because the x-ray image can be sent down a wire for analysis to any place in the world . "
" essentially , any service job that can be transported down a wire is insecure . "
the right skills so instead of recommending a certain profession , parents should ensure that their children learn the right skills that prepare them for this world of uncertainty .
" as parents we have to get our children to globalise as quickly as possible , " said a prominent politician .
but what does that mean ?
around the room , the same set of skills was mentioned again and again : ensure your children have language skills ; are good communicators ; know how to negotiate ; have people skills ; can understand and appreciate other cultures .
when you send your children abroad , said a top manager at one of the world 's best-known investment banks , do n't let them take soft options like travelling to the uk or italy .
" they should learn about countries like china or south africa . "
such options are , of course , not open to and affordable by everyone .
anyway , one participant said , what about the many unskilled and semi-skilled workers of this world - where does that leave them ?
protecting their jobs against cheaper and more qualified competitors would n't work , argued the banker : " it would be politically easy to protect these jobs , but 10 years down the line it will come back to bite you ... it 's the consumers and shareholders and pension funds who will lose out . "
instead " we need to do a better job of re-skilling " our workforce , he said .
suffering from affluenza whether we were millionaires , politicians , academics or humble reporters at the tables , the discussions quickly resembled parenting workshops , with mothers and fathers swapping stories of bringing up their -lrb- at times -rrb- wayward children .
a high-tech career is no guarantee for a secure job whichever country the parents came from - france , usa , russia , germany , lebanon , uk - they worried about the quality of their children 's schools .
" are our schools still competitive enough to teach our children what they need for life ? , " asked one of them .
their biggest worry , though , was motivation .
most people here were self-made millionaires and natural over-achievers .
they had learned hard , worked hard , but their children just did not have the same drive and ambition .
one could call it affluenza - the illness of being born rich .
" children with rich parents are simply lacking motivation , " complained one parent .
the multi-billionaire at our table was nodding in agreement .
" my solution is simple , " he said .
" i 've told my son that when he 's 18 years old , he 'll get one million dollars . "
" then he 's on his own , the rest goes to charity . "
coming from a billionaire , this is tough love .

ever wondered what career advice you should give to your child ?
after all , this is the age of globalisation .
jobs are outsourced and off-shored .
factories are taken apart , shipped out and rebuilt - nuts and bolts and all - in china .
once upon a time the solution seemed to be straightforward .
" move up the value chain , " we were told .
get high-tech skills and let cheap workers in developing countries get their hands dirty .
apart from the fact that his advice never quite worked for many people in manufacturing jobs , it 's also out-of-date .
these days engineers in china , india and elsewhere are just as qualified and innovative as those in silicon valley or silicon glen .
designers in south korea can be just as hip and cutting edge as those in turin or toronto .
' no clue ' but if you are worried about your children 's future , you are not alone .
the millionaires and billionaires attending last week 's world economic forum in davos are just as concerned about their offspring .
can schools prepare children for the globalised world ?
a lunchtime session called " what job should my child take in a globalizing economy ? " was completely booked out , filled with mothers and fathers at a loss of what to do .
however , those hoping for clear answers were quickly disappointed .
" do n't tell your child to be an engineer or be this or that , because we have no clue where future jobs will be , " warned one participant .
" the world is developing so rapidly , whichever job you recommend now will be out-of-date by the time they are out of university , " another chimed in .
and all agreed that the notion of a lifelong job with the same company was obsolete .
still , the discussions at each table of 10 seemed to reach the same conclusions .
down the wire some jobs would be safe because they depended on " personal relations " , for example in industries like health , education and care for the elderly .
but even there one had to differentiate , said one participant .
" the job of a nurse is more secure than that of a radiologist , " she argued , " because the x-ray image can be sent down a wire for analysis to any place in the world . "
" essentially , any service job that can be transported down a wire is insecure . "
the right skills so instead of recommending a certain profession , parents should ensure that their children learn the right skills that prepare them for this world of uncertainty .
" as parents we have to get our children to globalise as quickly as possible , " said a prominent politician .
but what does that mean ?
around the room , the same set of skills was mentioned again and again : ensure your children have language skills ; are good communicators ; know how to negotiate ; have people skills ; can understand and appreciate other cultures .
when you send your children abroad , said a top manager at one of the world 's best-known investment banks , do n't let them take soft options like travelling to the uk or italy .
" they should learn about countries like china or south africa . "
such options are , of course , not open to and affordable by everyone .
anyway , one participant said , what about the many unskilled and semi-skilled workers of this world - where does that leave them ?
protecting their jobs against cheaper and more qualified competitors would n't work , argued the banker : " it would be politically easy to protect these jobs , but 10 years down the line it will come back to bite you ... it 's the consumers and shareholders and pension funds who will lose out . "
instead " we need to do a better job of re-skilling " our workforce , he said .
suffering from affluenza whether we were millionaires , politicians , academics or humble reporters at the tables , the discussions quickly resembled parenting workshops , with mothers and fathers swapping stories of bringing up their -lrb- at times -rrb- wayward children .
a high-tech career is no guarantee for a secure job whichever country the parents came from - france , usa , russia , germany , lebanon , uk - they worried about the quality of their children 's schools .
" are our schools still competitive enough to teach our children what they need for life ? , " asked one of them .
their biggest worry , though , was motivation .
most people here were self-made millionaires and natural over-achievers .
they had learned hard , worked hard , but their children just did not have the same drive and ambition .
one could call it affluenza - the illness of being born rich .
" children with rich parents are simply lacking motivation , " complained one parent .
the multi-billionaire at our table was nodding in agreement .
" my solution is simple , " he said .
" i 've told my son that when he 's 18 years old , he 'll get one million dollars . "
" then he 's on his own , the rest goes to charity . "
coming from a billionaire , this is tough love .

business secretary john hutton accepted the findings of the competition commission 's study into bskyb 's stake .
bskyb has until monday 25 february to lodge an appeal against the decision .
itv said that it warmly welcomed the government 's decision , while bskyb said it would carefully consider the findings before deciding what to do .
paper loss on 17 november 2006 , bskyb announced that it had spent £ 940m buying 17.9 % of itv , but itv 's share price has fallen significantly since then .
the decision was made by business secretary john hutton itv share price bskyb share price bskyb bought the shares for 135 pence each .
they opened on tuesday up 1p at 73p .
at current prices , bskyb could lose about £ 250m from the sale of the shares .
mr hutton has decided not to announce how long he is giving bskyb to sell the shares .
media row virgin media argued that bskyb only bought the stake to block a takeover of itv .
but bskyb said it had not sought to influence itv and had only bought the shares as an investment .
the shares were bought at a time when itv was struggling without a chairman and ntl , which has since been rebranded as virgin media , was considering a takeover bid .
four days after bskyb bought the stake , itv rejected ntl 's approach saying it undervalued the company .
a week after that , itv announced that michael grade was leaving the bbc to become its new chairman .
the competition commission ruled in december last year that bskyb 's shareholding was bad for competition and not in the public interest .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- why 3d is about to break through bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 29 january 2008 , 08:56 gmt why 3d is about to break through by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website for a long time 3d movies and tv shows have been a bit of a gimmick .
they have been used to re-energise a tired franchise , help a film stand out at a crowded box office or to give tv viewers a glimpse of what the future might hold .
but many in the 3d production industry now say that future may be closer than ever before .
film makers , technology companies and post-production outfits recently gathered at the historic shepperton studios to assess just how far 3d has come and where it goes next .
the 3d technology gathering favour is based around stereoscopic projection .
as its name implies this involves projecting two images .
the viewer wears spectacles that ensure one image goes to each eye and lets the brain piece the two together to give the sense of solidity .
catch and release " 3d has always been seen as complicated because you had technical issues during acquisition , post-production and distribution , " said mark horton from quantel - a maker of digital editing equipment .
" now we have digital acquisition and digital distribution and digital projection systems a lot of those problems have gone away , " he said .
more high profile movies , such as beowulf , are being produced in 3d in the past , said mr horton , one of the biggest problems was that there was no way to know if the images being shot on two cameras in preparation for 3d projection would match until the film was developed .
" you could not see stereo effects when you were shooting , " he said .
" now you can see what you are doing while you are doing it and that 's a big step forward . "
phil streather , a film maker who created the 3d imax movie bugs ! , said : " it was hard to make it good but it is getting easier . "
" where the tools are getting really sophisticated now is in the level of control between the two cameras , " he said .
stereoscopic 3d works using two lenses set the same distance apart as human eyes - about 6.3cm.
" you 've got interaction controls or intra-ocular controls and convergence controls dynamically in the same shot , " he said .
" that 's what you need to do for sports or concert work or any of that live action stuff . "
axis films , which hosted the day at shepperton , said it was now possible to shoot stereoscopic 3d footage with everything from minicams up to high end movie cameras .
paul carter , boss of axis films , said digital production systems had made it much cheaper to shoot in 3d .
before now , he said , filming a movie in 3d involved hiring specialist staff and equipment which could add thousands of dollars per day to a shoot .
" with digital there 's only a 20-30 % cost difference on the whole process and that 's making a lot of people shooting 2d consider giving it a go , " he said .
" 3d is starting to get rid of the image that it 's a dark art , " he said .
cutting crew axis has set up one of the first dedicated 3d editing suites in europe in response to the amount of work now being done in 3d .
editing stereoscopic images presents particular problems because of the need to keep the two images synchronised .
care must be taken to ensure that the sequence of images matches and that one is not a different colour , lags a frame behind or has an artefact , such as dirt or lens flare , that the other lacks .
" if you leave errors in your brain will try to correct them and that 's not going to be a very comfortable programme or film to watch , " said mr horton from quantel .
charlotte jones , cinema analyst at screen digest , said digital projection systems in cinemas were helping to make watching 3d movies a more pleasant experience .
digital projectors do a much better job of handling the high frame rates -lrb- 144 frames per second -rrb- demanded by 3d that can preserve the details of a scene .
" previous eras of 3d were associated with bad colour and headaches , " she said .
the number of cinema screens worldwide capable of showing 3d movies has grown from 98 in 2005 to more than 1,300 at the end of 2007 and is predicted to pass 3,000 by the end of 2008 , said ms jones .
however , she added , older cinemas keen to convert may have to install a silvered screen that does a better job of reflecting the polarised light used to separate images .
this growth reflected a growing interest in 3d by movie studios , said ms jones .
more and more high profile films , such as beowulf , were being produced in 3d .
disney has a strong interest in 3d and dreamworks has committed to producing all its movies in 3d from 2009 .
" it 's helping to give people a reason to go back to the cinema , " she said .
however , she added , many movie studios made the bulk of their profits from the sale of ancillary material such as dvds - something that could be hit by the growing interest in 3d given the small number of tvs in homes capable of showing these images .
but this too is changing .
already , said mr horton , stereoscopic tvs are available from samsung , mitsubishi and philips .
there have also been stereoscopic broadcasts in japan with more due to follow in china and korea .
an entire stereoscopic channel is being produced for footage shot at the olympic games in beijing .
it looks like the future of 3d is firming up .

they have been used to re-energise a tired franchise , help a film stand out at a crowded box office or to give tv viewers a glimpse of what the future might hold .
but many in the 3d production industry now say that future may be closer than ever before .
film makers , technology companies and post-production outfits recently gathered at the historic shepperton studios to assess just how far 3d has come and where it goes next .
the 3d technology gathering favour is based around stereoscopic projection .
as its name implies this involves projecting two images .
the viewer wears spectacles that ensure one image goes to each eye and lets the brain piece the two together to give the sense of solidity .
catch and release " 3d has always been seen as complicated because you had technical issues during acquisition , post-production and distribution , " said mark horton from quantel - a maker of digital editing equipment .
" now we have digital acquisition and digital distribution and digital projection systems a lot of those problems have gone away , " he said .
more high profile movies , such as beowulf , are being produced in 3d film industry 's views in the past , said mr horton , one of the biggest problems was that there was no way to know if the images being shot on two cameras in preparation for 3d projection would match until the film was developed .
" you could not see stereo effects when you were shooting , " he said .
" now you can see what you are doing while you are doing it and that 's a big step forward . "
phil streather , a film maker who created the 3d imax movie bugs ! , said : " it was hard to make it good but it is getting easier . "
" where the tools are getting really sophisticated now is in the level of control between the two cameras , " he said .
stereoscopic 3d works using two lenses set the same distance apart as human eyes - about 6.3cm.
" you 've got interaction controls or intra-ocular controls and convergence controls dynamically in the same shot , " he said .
" that 's what you need to do for sports or concert work or any of that live action stuff . "
axis films , which hosted the day at shepperton , said it was now possible to shoot stereoscopic 3d footage with everything from minicams up to high end movie cameras .
paul carter , boss of axis films , said digital production systems had made it much cheaper to shoot in 3d .
before now , he said , filming a movie in 3d involved hiring specialist staff and equipment which could add thousands of dollars per day to a shoot .
" with digital there 's only a 20-30 % cost difference on the whole process and that 's making a lot of people shooting 2d consider giving it a go , " he said .
" 3d is starting to get rid of the image that it 's a dark art , " he said .
cutting crew axis has set up one of the first dedicated 3d editing suites in europe in response to the amount of work now being done in 3d .
editing stereoscopic images presents particular problems because of the need to keep the two images synchronised .
care must be taken to ensure that the sequence of images matches and that one is not a different colour , lags a frame behind or has an artefact , such as dirt or lens flare , that the other lacks .
" if you leave errors in your brain will try to correct them and that 's not going to be a very comfortable programme or film to watch , " said mr horton from quantel .

they have been used to re-energise a tired franchise , help a film stand out at a crowded box office or to give tv viewers a glimpse of what the future might hold .
but many in the 3d production industry now say that future may be closer than ever before .
film makers , technology companies and post-production outfits recently gathered at the historic shepperton studios to assess just how far 3d has come and where it goes next .
the 3d technology gathering favour is based around stereoscopic projection .
as its name implies this involves projecting two images .
the viewer wears spectacles that ensure one image goes to each eye and lets the brain piece the two together to give the sense of solidity .
catch and release " 3d has always been seen as complicated because you had technical issues during acquisition , post-production and distribution , " said mark horton from quantel - a maker of digital editing equipment .
" now we have digital acquisition and digital distribution and digital projection systems a lot of those problems have gone away , " he said .
more high profile movies , such as beowulf , are being produced in 3d film industry 's views in the past , said mr horton , one of the biggest problems was that there was no way to know if the images being shot on two cameras in preparation for 3d projection would match until the film was developed .
" you could not see stereo effects when you were shooting , " he said .
" now you can see what you are doing while you are doing it and that 's a big step forward . "
phil streather , a film maker who created the 3d imax movie bugs ! , said : " it was hard to make it good but it is getting easier . "
" where the tools are getting really sophisticated now is in the level of control between the two cameras , " he said .
stereoscopic 3d works using two lenses set the same distance apart as human eyes - about 6.3cm.
" you 've got interaction controls or intra-ocular controls and convergence controls dynamically in the same shot , " he said .
" that 's what you need to do for sports or concert work or any of that live action stuff . "
axis films , which hosted the day at shepperton , said it was now possible to shoot stereoscopic 3d footage with everything from minicams up to high end movie cameras .
paul carter , boss of axis films , said digital production systems had made it much cheaper to shoot in 3d .
before now , he said , filming a movie in 3d involved hiring specialist staff and equipment which could add thousands of dollars per day to a shoot .
" with digital there 's only a 20-30 % cost difference on the whole process and that 's making a lot of people shooting 2d consider giving it a go , " he said .
" 3d is starting to get rid of the image that it 's a dark art , " he said .
cutting crew axis has set up one of the first dedicated 3d editing suites in europe in response to the amount of work now being done in 3d .
editing stereoscopic images presents particular problems because of the need to keep the two images synchronised .
care must be taken to ensure that the sequence of images matches and that one is not a different colour , lags a frame behind or has an artefact , such as dirt or lens flare , that the other lacks .
" if you leave errors in your brain will try to correct them and that 's not going to be a very comfortable programme or film to watch , " said mr horton from quantel .
3d projectors cast two images that must be viewed through filters charlotte jones , cinema analyst at screen digest , said digital projection systems in cinemas were helping to make watching 3d movies a more pleasant experience .
digital projectors do a much better job of handling the high frame rates -lrb- 144 frames per second -rrb- demanded by 3d that can preserve the details of a scene .
" previous eras of 3d were associated with bad colour and headaches , " she said .
the number of cinema screens worldwide capable of showing 3d movies has grown from 98 in 2005 to more than 1,300 at the end of 2007 and is predicted to pass 3,000 by the end of 2008 , said ms jones .
however , she added , older cinemas keen to convert may have to install a silvered screen that does a better job of reflecting the polarised light used to separate images .
this growth reflected a growing interest in 3d by movie studios , said ms jones .
more and more high profile films , such as beowulf , were being produced in 3d .
disney has a strong interest in 3d and dreamworks has committed to producing all its movies in 3d from 2009 .
" it 's helping to give people a reason to go back to the cinema , " she said .
however , she added , many movie studios made the bulk of their profits from the sale of ancillary material such as dvds - something that could be hit by the growing interest in 3d given the small number of tvs in homes capable of showing these images .
but this too is changing .
already , said mr horton , stereoscopic tvs are available from samsung , mitsubishi and philips .
there have also been stereoscopic broadcasts in japan with more due to follow in china and korea .
an entire stereoscopic channel is being produced for footage shot at the olympic games in beijing .
it looks like the future of 3d is firming up .

the 3d technology gathering favour is based around stereoscopic projection .
as its name implies this involves projecting two images .
the viewer wears spectacles that ensure one image goes to each eye and lets the brain piece the two together to give the sense of solidity .
catch and release " 3d has always been seen as complicated because you had technical issues during acquisition , post-production and distribution , " said mark horton from quantel - a maker of digital editing equipment .
" now we have digital acquisition and digital distribution and digital projection systems a lot of those problems have gone away , " he said .
more high profile movies , such as beowulf , are being produced in 3d film industry 's views in the past , said mr horton , one of the biggest problems was that there was no way to know if the images being shot on two cameras in preparation for 3d projection would match until the film was developed .
" you could not see stereo effects when you were shooting , " he said .
" now you can see what you are doing while you are doing it and that 's a big step forward . "
phil streather , a film maker who created the 3d imax movie bugs ! , said : " it was hard to make it good but it is getting easier . "
" where the tools are getting really sophisticated now is in the level of control between the two cameras , " he said .
stereoscopic 3d works using two lenses set the same distance apart as human eyes - about 6.3cm.
" you 've got interaction controls or intra-ocular controls and convergence controls dynamically in the same shot , " he said .
" that 's what you need to do for sports or concert work or any of that live action stuff . "
axis films , which hosted the day at shepperton , said it was now possible to shoot stereoscopic 3d footage with everything from minicams up to high end movie cameras .
paul carter , boss of axis films , said digital production systems had made it much cheaper to shoot in 3d .
before now , he said , filming a movie in 3d involved hiring specialist staff and equipment which could add thousands of dollars per day to a shoot .
" with digital there 's only a 20-30 % cost difference on the whole process and that 's making a lot of people shooting 2d consider giving it a go , " he said .
" 3d is starting to get rid of the image that it 's a dark art , " he said .
cutting crew axis has set up one of the first dedicated 3d editing suites in europe in response to the amount of work now being done in 3d .
editing stereoscopic images presents particular problems because of the need to keep the two images synchronised .
care must be taken to ensure that the sequence of images matches and that one is not a different colour , lags a frame behind or has an artefact , such as dirt or lens flare , that the other lacks .
" if you leave errors in your brain will try to correct them and that 's not going to be a very comfortable programme or film to watch , " said mr horton from quantel .
3d projectors cast two images that must be viewed through filters charlotte jones , cinema analyst at screen digest , said digital projection systems in cinemas were helping to make watching 3d movies a more pleasant experience .
digital projectors do a much better job of handling the high frame rates -lrb- 144 frames per second -rrb- demanded by 3d that can preserve the details of a scene .
" previous eras of 3d were associated with bad colour and headaches , " she said .
the number of cinema screens worldwide capable of showing 3d movies has grown from 98 in 2005 to more than 1,300 at the end of 2007 and is predicted to pass 3,000 by the end of 2008 , said ms jones .
however , she added , older cinemas keen to convert may have to install a silvered screen that does a better job of reflecting the polarised light used to separate images .
this growth reflected a growing interest in 3d by movie studios , said ms jones .
more and more high profile films , such as beowulf , were being produced in 3d .
disney has a strong interest in 3d and dreamworks has committed to producing all its movies in 3d from 2009 .
" it 's helping to give people a reason to go back to the cinema , " she said .
however , she added , many movie studios made the bulk of their profits from the sale of ancillary material such as dvds - something that could be hit by the growing interest in 3d given the small number of tvs in homes capable of showing these images .
but this too is changing .
already , said mr horton , stereoscopic tvs are available from samsung , mitsubishi and philips .
there have also been stereoscopic broadcasts in japan with more due to follow in china and korea .
an entire stereoscopic channel is being produced for footage shot at the olympic games in beijing .
it looks like the future of 3d is firming up .
