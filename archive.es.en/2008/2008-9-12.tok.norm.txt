" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the deal will affect zimbabwe is also unclear un secretary general ban ki-moon praised mbeki 's " tireless efforts to help -lrb- the zimbabwean leaders -rrb- reach it . "
" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .
zimbabweans have been hoping for a negotiated settlement to resolve the country 's nearly decade-long political and economic crisis , blamed largely on mugabe 's populist policies . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .

the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .

it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?

" perhaps so , " was the answer sarah palin gave abc news interviewer charles gibson when asked if the us would be obligated to engage in war with russia should the latter invade georgia again .
" i mean , that is the agreement when you are a nato ally , " continued the anti-abortion and pro-gun rights mother of five .
" you 're going to be expected to be called upon and help . "
while underlining her position regarding russia , palin also noted her belief that both georgia and ukraine should be admitted into the western alliance .
the relatively unknown governor of alaska until john mccain made waves by choosing her as his vice presidential pick in the white house race , palin has been particularly criticized for her lack of experience in foreign affairs .
stepping into the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin emphasized her country 's obligation to protect georgia from another russian attack she used her first media interview , however , to make her position on russia known .
" we 've got to keep an eye on russia , under the leadership there .
for russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable , " she said , referring to moscow 's five-day war with georgia last month .
during the interview , palin was also asked to comment on the mccain camp 's contention that she was well aware of the importance of us-moscow relations because of her state 's proximity to russia - a point that recently drew ridicule from the media .
but the alaska governor maintained her position , telling gibson , " they 're our next-door neighbors , and you can see russia from land here . "
in the interview , palin also told gibson she would be prepared to assume the job of president if it became necessary : " i have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you ca n't blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission that we 're on , " she said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.09.2008 putin denies imperial ambitions as russia warns ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister vladimir putin sees no need for talk of cold war russia 's powerful premier vladimir putin said thursday , sept .
11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .
crimea may be next : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's black sea fleet is based at sevastopol on the crimea peninsula french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned in the wake of the conflict that the kremlin could again resort to force to carry to term imperialist designs on ukraine 's crimean peninsula , where moscow rents a port for its black sea fleet .
but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .
" we made this decision a long time ago , and we do not have any desire or any intention to encroach on the sovereignty of republics of the former ussr . "
russian forces must re-arm : medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev believes russia must re-arm after georgia conflict on the ground in georgia there were increasing signs that russian forces were withdrawing in line with a pledge on monday by president dmitry medvedev after he met an eu delegation in moscow .
russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .
an afp reporter saw soldiers packing up three posts .
but medvedev said georgia 's august 7 assault on the moscow-backed breakaway region of south ossetia meant russia would have to think about re-arming its military .
" we should concentrate on questions of military re-equipment , " medvedev said at a kremlin meeting .
" without any doubt this decision is influenced by the crisis in the caucasus , georgia 's aggression and its continued militarization . "
ukraine in russia 's scopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko ' pro-western government is in moscow 's sights international tensions over the georgia crisis flared with russia accusing ukraine 's pro-western government of taking an " unfriendly " stance over the war and of infringing the rights of russian-speaking residents .
ukraine is a strong ally of georgia .
" ukrainian authorities have recently been pursuing policies that can not be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards russia , " a strongly worded foreign ministry statement said .
western officials have expressed concern that ukraine 's large ethnic russian population could leave it exposed to intervention from moscow , with the eu 's enlargement commissioner warning ukraine could be russia 's " next target . "
putin sought to reassure the west that this was not the case .
" we do not have any desire or basis for infringing the sovereignty of former soviet republics , " the russian leader said in sochi . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .
crimea may be next : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's black sea fleet is based at sevastopol on the crimea peninsula french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned in the wake of the conflict that the kremlin could again resort to force to carry to term imperialist designs on ukraine 's crimean peninsula , where moscow rents a port for its black sea fleet .
but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .
" we made this decision a long time ago , and we do not have any desire or any intention to encroach on the sovereignty of republics of the former ussr . "

russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .
an afp reporter saw soldiers packing up three posts .
but medvedev said georgia 's august 7 assault on the moscow-backed breakaway region of south ossetia meant russia would have to think about re-arming its military .

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .

the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .

" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .

a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .

the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

10 , both deutsche bank and deutsche post confirmed that talks were advanced , but stressed that the outcome was open .
spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 12.09.2008 in paris , pope calls for revamp of church-state divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the pope and sarkozy agree that religion has its place in public referring to france as the catholic church ’ s “ eldest daughter , ” pope benedict began his four-day visit to the nation by calling upon the french to rethink the separation of religion and state . greeted by french president nicolas sarkozy and his wife carla bruni when he arrived at orly airport , the pontiff 's visit to france comes at a time when the number of churchgoers in the country is plummeting .
sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”

a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .

within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "

on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the deal will affect zimbabwe is also unclear un secretary general ban ki-moon praised mbeki 's " tireless efforts to help -lrb- the zimbabwean leaders -rrb- reach it . "
" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .
zimbabweans have been hoping for a negotiated settlement to resolve the country 's nearly decade-long political and economic crisis , blamed largely on mugabe 's populist policies . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .

the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .

the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .

they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .

" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "

a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .

within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .

they have added to the barrage of words between russian and western officials over the georgia conflict . medvedev added that nato membership for georgia would be unjust , humiliating and intolerable to moscow .
furthermore , he said russia would have invaded georgia even if it was a member of nato . nato debates its options " nato wo n't become stronger this way , global tensions wo n't be reduced .

" what happened in the last few weeks is a reminder how security is always changing , " he added . one issue that seems to be off the agenda for nato officials is the possible membership fo georgia in the alliance . nato officials to visit georgia the north atlantic council , which groups ambassadors from all 26 nato members , plans a two-day trip starting monday , sept .
15 , that includes a stop in gori , a strategic town shelled by russian forces during last month 's fighting between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian city of gori saw a lot of fighting nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the diplomats would meet with president mikheil saakashvili 's government , the opposition and non-governmental groups .

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .

nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”

" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the deal will affect zimbabwe is also unclear un secretary general ban ki-moon praised mbeki 's " tireless efforts to help -lrb- the zimbabwean leaders -rrb- reach it . "
" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .
zimbabweans have been hoping for a negotiated settlement to resolve the country 's nearly decade-long political and economic crisis , blamed largely on mugabe 's populist policies . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .

masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .

masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

11 , 2001 .
his words came as nato diplomats discussed the recent events in the caucasus . looking back over the month since war broke out in the disputed georgian province of south ossetia , russian president dmitry medvedev told a group of russia experts that " the world has changed . " " almost immediately after these events it occurred to me that for russia , august 8 , 2008 was almost like september 11 , 2001 in the united states , " said medvedev at the meeting in moscow . ongoing war of words on august 8 , russian troops rolled into georgian territory in order to force back georgian troops who were trying to regain control of the breakaway province . the president 's comments came just one day after the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in the us .
they have added to the barrage of words between russian and western officials over the georgia conflict . medvedev added that nato membership for georgia would be unjust , humiliating and intolerable to moscow .
furthermore , he said russia would have invaded georgia even if it was a member of nato . nato debates its options " nato wo n't become stronger this way , global tensions wo n't be reduced .
what if georgia had a nato membership action plan ?

12 , the chiefs of staff from nato 's 26 member countries met in sofia , bulgaria to discuss how the alliance should address defense issues in the wake of the georgian conflict . " we have to prepare the alliance to meet the security challenges of the future , " said italy 's admiral giampaolo di paola , the new chairman of nato 's military committee . " what happened in the last few weeks is a reminder how security is always changing , " he added . one issue that seems to be off the agenda for nato officials is the possible membership fo georgia in the alliance . nato officials to visit georgia the north atlantic council , which groups ambassadors from all 26 nato members , plans a two-day trip starting monday , sept .
15 , that includes a stop in gori , a strategic town shelled by russian forces during last month 's fighting between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian city of gori saw a lot of fighting nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the diplomats would meet with president mikheil saakashvili 's government , the opposition and non-governmental groups . " we 'll pay a visit to gori to show support for georgia after what we 've seen from the russian side , " scheffer told reporters in riga . russia this week urged the council to put off its trip , which nato officials say has been planned for some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu observers in georgia face many hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians have announced their withdrawal and set their conditions the eu is picking up the pace .
within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu observers in georgia face many hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians have announced their withdrawal and set their conditions the eu is picking up the pace .
within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu observers in georgia face many hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians have announced their withdrawal and set their conditions the eu is picking up the pace .
within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .

" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the deal will affect zimbabwe is also unclear un secretary general ban ki-moon praised mbeki 's " tireless efforts to help -lrb- the zimbabwean leaders -rrb- reach it . "
" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .

" " almost immediately after these events it occurred to me that for russia , august 8 , 2008 was almost like september 11 , 2001 in the united states , " said medvedev at the meeting in moscow . ongoing war of words on august 8 , russian troops rolled into georgian territory in order to force back georgian troops who were trying to regain control of the breakaway province . the president 's comments came just one day after the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in the us .
they have added to the barrage of words between russian and western officials over the georgia conflict . medvedev added that nato membership for georgia would be unjust , humiliating and intolerable to moscow .
furthermore , he said russia would have invaded georgia even if it was a member of nato . nato debates its options " nato wo n't become stronger this way , global tensions wo n't be reduced .
what if georgia had a nato membership action plan ?

" what happened in the last few weeks is a reminder how security is always changing , " he added . one issue that seems to be off the agenda for nato officials is the possible membership fo georgia in the alliance . nato officials to visit georgia the north atlantic council , which groups ambassadors from all 26 nato members , plans a two-day trip starting monday , sept .
15 , that includes a stop in gori , a strategic town shelled by russian forces during last month 's fighting between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian city of gori saw a lot of fighting nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the diplomats would meet with president mikheil saakashvili 's government , the opposition and non-governmental groups .

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "

rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .

" perhaps so , " was the answer sarah palin gave abc news interviewer charles gibson when asked if the us would be obligated to engage in war with russia should the latter invade georgia again .
" i mean , that is the agreement when you are a nato ally , " continued the anti-abortion and pro-gun rights mother of five .

while underlining her position regarding russia , palin also noted her belief that both georgia and ukraine should be admitted into the western alliance .

" we 've got to keep an eye on russia , under the leadership there .
for russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable , " she said , referring to moscow 's five-day war with georgia last month .
during the interview , palin was also asked to comment on the mccain camp 's contention that she was well aware of the importance of us-moscow relations because of her state 's proximity to russia - a point that recently drew ridicule from the media .
but the alaska governor maintained her position , telling gibson , " they 're our next-door neighbors , and you can see russia from land here . "
in the interview , palin also told gibson she would be prepared to assume the job of president if it became necessary : " i have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you ca n't blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission that we 're on , " she said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .

but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .

russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .

ukraine is a strong ally of georgia .
" ukrainian authorities have recently been pursuing policies that can not be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards russia , " a strongly worded foreign ministry statement said .

11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .
crimea may be next : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's black sea fleet is based at sevastopol on the crimea peninsula french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned in the wake of the conflict that the kremlin could again resort to force to carry to term imperialist designs on ukraine 's crimean peninsula , where moscow rents a port for its black sea fleet .
but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .
" we made this decision a long time ago , and we do not have any desire or any intention to encroach on the sovereignty of republics of the former ussr . "
russian forces must re-arm : medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev believes russia must re-arm after georgia conflict on the ground in georgia there were increasing signs that russian forces were withdrawing in line with a pledge on monday by president dmitry medvedev after he met an eu delegation in moscow .
russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .
an afp reporter saw soldiers packing up three posts .
but medvedev said georgia 's august 7 assault on the moscow-backed breakaway region of south ossetia meant russia would have to think about re-arming its military .
" we should concentrate on questions of military re-equipment , " medvedev said at a kremlin meeting .
" without any doubt this decision is influenced by the crisis in the caucasus , georgia 's aggression and its continued militarization . "
ukraine in russia 's scopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko ' pro-western government is in moscow 's sights international tensions over the georgia crisis flared with russia accusing ukraine 's pro-western government of taking an " unfriendly " stance over the war and of infringing the rights of russian-speaking residents .
ukraine is a strong ally of georgia .
" ukrainian authorities have recently been pursuing policies that can not be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards russia , " a strongly worded foreign ministry statement said .
western officials have expressed concern that ukraine 's large ethnic russian population could leave it exposed to intervention from moscow , with the eu 's enlargement commissioner warning ukraine could be russia 's " next target . "
putin sought to reassure the west that this was not the case .
" we do not have any desire or basis for infringing the sovereignty of former soviet republics , " the russian leader said in sochi . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , the basque government said it " respected " the ruling , but regarded it as undemocratic and would not " resign , " basque regional prime minister juan jose ibarretxe said .
the basque parliament had previously authorized the referendum-like vote to be staged on october 25 .
the spanish government lodged a complaint at the constitutional court , the country 's highest court alongside the supreme court .
in a unanimous ruling late thursday , sept .
11 , the court said the vote was unconstitutional , because only the spanish government had the right to authorize referendums .
the basque premier 's office immediately accused the court of partiality .
" the judiciary has let pass an opportunity to demonstrate its independence and shown once again that is penetrated by politics , " the office said a communique released overnight .
the vote would have asked the basques whether they approved of a negotiated solution to spain 's conflict with the militant basque separatist group eta and of basque party talks on the region 's right to decide its own future .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government feared that the referendum would encourage separatism in the region of 2.1 million people .
ibarretxe believes that an open discussion about options including independence would help to solve the problem of eta , which has killed more than 820 people in its four-decade campaign for a sovereign basque state . dpa news agency -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .

" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the deal will affect zimbabwe is also unclear un secretary general ban ki-moon praised mbeki 's " tireless efforts to help -lrb- the zimbabwean leaders -rrb- reach it . "
" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .
zimbabweans have been hoping for a negotiated settlement to resolve the country 's nearly decade-long political and economic crisis , blamed largely on mugabe 's populist policies . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the seventh symphony was premiered in 1813 , when the composer ’ s health and hearing were in decline .
he would become completely deaf by 1814 . performing is the orchestre national de france , conducted by the legendary kurt masur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .

11 , 2001 .
his words came as nato diplomats discussed the recent events in the caucasus . looking back over the month since war broke out in the disputed georgian province of south ossetia , russian president dmitry medvedev told a group of russia experts that " the world has changed . " " almost immediately after these events it occurred to me that for russia , august 8 , 2008 was almost like september 11 , 2001 in the united states , " said medvedev at the meeting in moscow . ongoing war of words on august 8 , russian troops rolled into georgian territory in order to force back georgian troops who were trying to regain control of the breakaway province . the president 's comments came just one day after the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in the us .
they have added to the barrage of words between russian and western officials over the georgia conflict . medvedev added that nato membership for georgia would be unjust , humiliating and intolerable to moscow .
furthermore , he said russia would have invaded georgia even if it was a member of nato . nato debates its options " nato wo n't become stronger this way , global tensions wo n't be reduced .
what if georgia had a nato membership action plan ?
i would not wait for a second in making the decision i made at that time , " medvedev said . " what would the consequences be ?
they could be much worse , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's scheffer tries to reassure members among nato countries that have become increasingly concerned over the russian incursion into georgia are estonia , latvia and lithuania - all former soviet satellites .

12 , the chiefs of staff from nato 's 26 member countries met in sofia , bulgaria to discuss how the alliance should address defense issues in the wake of the georgian conflict . " we have to prepare the alliance to meet the security challenges of the future , " said italy 's admiral giampaolo di paola , the new chairman of nato 's military committee . " what happened in the last few weeks is a reminder how security is always changing , " he added . one issue that seems to be off the agenda for nato officials is the possible membership fo georgia in the alliance . nato officials to visit georgia the north atlantic council , which groups ambassadors from all 26 nato members , plans a two-day trip starting monday , sept .
15 , that includes a stop in gori , a strategic town shelled by russian forces during last month 's fighting between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian city of gori saw a lot of fighting nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the diplomats would meet with president mikheil saakashvili 's government , the opposition and non-governmental groups . " we 'll pay a visit to gori to show support for georgia after what we 've seen from the russian side , " scheffer told reporters in riga . russia this week urged the council to put off its trip , which nato officials say has been planned for some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" perhaps so , " was the answer sarah palin gave abc news interviewer charles gibson when asked if the us would be obligated to engage in war with russia should the latter invade georgia again .
" i mean , that is the agreement when you are a nato ally , " continued the anti-abortion and pro-gun rights mother of five .
" you 're going to be expected to be called upon and help . "
while underlining her position regarding russia , palin also noted her belief that both georgia and ukraine should be admitted into the western alliance .
the relatively unknown governor of alaska until john mccain made waves by choosing her as his vice presidential pick in the white house race , palin has been particularly criticized for her lack of experience in foreign affairs .
stepping into the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin emphasized her country 's obligation to protect georgia from another russian attack she used her first media interview , however , to make her position on russia known .
" we 've got to keep an eye on russia , under the leadership there .
for russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable , " she said , referring to moscow 's five-day war with georgia last month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

12 , the basque government said it " respected " the ruling , but regarded it as undemocratic and would not " resign , " basque regional prime minister juan jose ibarretxe said .
the basque parliament had previously authorized the referendum-like vote to be staged on october 25 .
the spanish government lodged a complaint at the constitutional court , the country 's highest court alongside the supreme court .
in a unanimous ruling late thursday , sept .
11 , the court said the vote was unconstitutional , because only the spanish government had the right to authorize referendums .
the basque premier 's office immediately accused the court of partiality .
" the judiciary has let pass an opportunity to demonstrate its independence and shown once again that is penetrated by politics , " the office said a communique released overnight .
the vote would have asked the basques whether they approved of a negotiated solution to spain 's conflict with the militant basque separatist group eta and of basque party talks on the region 's right to decide its own future .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government feared that the referendum would encourage separatism in the region of 2.1 million people .

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu observers in georgia face many hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians have announced their withdrawal and set their conditions the eu is picking up the pace .
within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .
crimea may be next : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's black sea fleet is based at sevastopol on the crimea peninsula french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned in the wake of the conflict that the kremlin could again resort to force to carry to term imperialist designs on ukraine 's crimean peninsula , where moscow rents a port for its black sea fleet .
but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .

russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .

ukraine is a strong ally of georgia .
" ukrainian authorities have recently been pursuing policies that can not be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards russia , " a strongly worded foreign ministry statement said .
western officials have expressed concern that ukraine 's large ethnic russian population could leave it exposed to intervention from moscow , with the eu 's enlargement commissioner warning ukraine could be russia 's " next target . "

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 12.09.2008 deutsche bank takes nearly 30 percent stake in postbank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians favored an all german merger after a spanish bank made a bid deutsche bank said it would buy nearly 30 percent of deutsche post subsidiary postbank , in a merger that reflects a recent trend of consolidation in the banking industry . germany ’ s postbank , a unit of former german postal monopoly deutsche post ag , has always been the savings bank for the average retail customer - a place where he or she could make small deposits and buy postage stamps at the same time . now the country 's mammoth deutsche bank has agreed to buy a 29.75 percent stake in postbank for 2.79 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in cash . a statement released on friday , sept .
12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank was always the bank for the regular guy all three companies - deutsche bank , deutsche post and postbank are among germany 's top-30 listed on the dax exchange . consolidation trend in banking sector post ag had owned more than half of all postbank shares , with the remaining shares floated on the market .
the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ag will concentrate on its core business on wednesday evening , sept .
10 , both deutsche bank and deutsche post confirmed that talks were advanced , but stressed that the outcome was open .
spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .
the merger of rival commerzbank and dresdner bank could result in the loss of 6,500 jobs . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .

the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .

the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .
crimea may be next : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's black sea fleet is based at sevastopol on the crimea peninsula french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned in the wake of the conflict that the kremlin could again resort to force to carry to term imperialist designs on ukraine 's crimean peninsula , where moscow rents a port for its black sea fleet .
but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .
" we made this decision a long time ago , and we do not have any desire or any intention to encroach on the sovereignty of republics of the former ussr . "
russian forces must re-arm : medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev believes russia must re-arm after georgia conflict on the ground in georgia there were increasing signs that russian forces were withdrawing in line with a pledge on monday by president dmitry medvedev after he met an eu delegation in moscow .
russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .
an afp reporter saw soldiers packing up three posts .
but medvedev said georgia 's august 7 assault on the moscow-backed breakaway region of south ossetia meant russia would have to think about re-arming its military .
" we should concentrate on questions of military re-equipment , " medvedev said at a kremlin meeting .
" without any doubt this decision is influenced by the crisis in the caucasus , georgia 's aggression and its continued militarization . "
ukraine in russia 's scopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko ' pro-western government is in moscow 's sights international tensions over the georgia crisis flared with russia accusing ukraine 's pro-western government of taking an " unfriendly " stance over the war and of infringing the rights of russian-speaking residents .
ukraine is a strong ally of georgia .
" ukrainian authorities have recently been pursuing policies that can not be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards russia , " a strongly worded foreign ministry statement said .
western officials have expressed concern that ukraine 's large ethnic russian population could leave it exposed to intervention from moscow , with the eu 's enlargement commissioner warning ukraine could be russia 's " next target . "
putin sought to reassure the west that this was not the case .

while underlining her position regarding russia , palin also noted her belief that both georgia and ukraine should be admitted into the western alliance .

for russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable , " she said , referring to moscow 's five-day war with georgia last month .
during the interview , palin was also asked to comment on the mccain camp 's contention that she was well aware of the importance of us-moscow relations because of her state 's proximity to russia - a point that recently drew ridicule from the media .
but the alaska governor maintained her position , telling gibson , " they 're our next-door neighbors , and you can see russia from land here . "
in the interview , palin also told gibson she would be prepared to assume the job of president if it became necessary : " i have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you ca n't blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission that we 're on , " she said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank was always the bank for the regular guy all three companies - deutsche bank , deutsche post and postbank are among germany 's top-30 listed on the dax exchange . consolidation trend in banking sector post ag had owned more than half of all postbank shares , with the remaining shares floated on the market .
the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ag will concentrate on its core business on wednesday evening , sept .
10 , both deutsche bank and deutsche post confirmed that talks were advanced , but stressed that the outcome was open .
spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .

the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

12 , by the frankfurt-based deutsche bank - whose investment banking arm makes it the only major german player on wall street and london ’ s financial district - said the deal , which should be completed by the first quarter of next year , was subject to regulatory approval . postbank is germany ’ s biggest retail bank , with nearly 15 million customers . option to buy further stake later the bank said that post ag had also given deutsche bank an option to acquire another 18 percent of postbank for 55 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- per share .
that option could be exercised within a three year period from the time that the purchase deal of the initial stake closes .
under german law , a stake that is 30 percent and above would oblige a potential suitor to make an offer to buy the remaining shares listed on the stock market .
based on postbank 's current share prices , deutsche bank would have to fork out at least seven billion euros to fund a full acquistion , which would require it to raise fresh capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank was always the bank for the regular guy all three companies - deutsche bank , deutsche post and postbank are among germany 's top-30 listed on the dax exchange . consolidation trend in banking sector post ag had owned more than half of all postbank shares , with the remaining shares floated on the market .
the deal will be the second largest bank merger this month in germany , following the heels of commerzbank , which acquired its dresdner bank unit from the insurance giant allianz for 9.8 billion euros .
even before the commerzbank / dresdner merger , france 's credit mutuel made waves in july when it announced its acquisition of us citibank 's german network for nearly five billion euros , representing a move towards greater consolidation in the banking industry .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deutsche bank / postbank merger .
“ we simply need to do this to stay competitive and gain access to the benefits of international capital markets , ” he said at a banking conference in frankfurt on thursday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ag will concentrate on its core business on wednesday evening , sept .
10 , both deutsche bank and deutsche post confirmed that talks were advanced , but stressed that the outcome was open .
spanish bank was also a suitor the german financial newspaper handelsblatt had reported earlier in the week that the private spanish banking group santander , europe 's second largest bank in terms of market capitalization , was in the bidding for all of post ag 's shares .
banco santander was reportedly interested in a full takeover and had offered to buy out remaining postbank shareholders for an undisclosed sum .
but the german government and deutsche post ag chairman frank appel had favored an all-german merger instead . the deal also has germany 's unions up in arms over the possible loss of jobs in the consolidation process .
uwe foulong , leader of the german trade union verdi , told the bonn newspaper general anzeig er that thousands of jobs would be cut .

but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .

russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .
an afp reporter saw soldiers packing up three posts .
but medvedev said georgia 's august 7 assault on the moscow-backed breakaway region of south ossetia meant russia would have to think about re-arming its military .
" we should concentrate on questions of military re-equipment , " medvedev said at a kremlin meeting .
" without any doubt this decision is influenced by the crisis in the caucasus , georgia 's aggression and its continued militarization . "

12 , the basque government said it " respected " the ruling , but regarded it as undemocratic and would not " resign , " basque regional prime minister juan jose ibarretxe said .
the basque parliament had previously authorized the referendum-like vote to be staged on october 25 .
the spanish government lodged a complaint at the constitutional court , the country 's highest court alongside the supreme court .
in a unanimous ruling late thursday , sept .
11 , the court said the vote was unconstitutional , because only the spanish government had the right to authorize referendums .
the basque premier 's office immediately accused the court of partiality .
" the judiciary has let pass an opportunity to demonstrate its independence and shown once again that is penetrated by politics , " the office said a communique released overnight .
the vote would have asked the basques whether they approved of a negotiated solution to spain 's conflict with the militant basque separatist group eta and of basque party talks on the region 's right to decide its own future .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government feared that the referendum would encourage separatism in the region of 2.1 million people .
ibarretxe believes that an open discussion about options including independence would help to solve the problem of eta , which has killed more than 820 people in its four-decade campaign for a sovereign basque state . dpa news agency -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .

according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .

nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu observers in georgia face many hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians have announced their withdrawal and set their conditions the eu is picking up the pace .
within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .

" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu ministers vow unified approach to downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders agreed to avoid costly stimulus packages in the recession fight europe will not repeat the mistakes of the past and spend its way out of a recession , eurozone finance ministers said as they rejected calls for a us-style stimulus package to combat the continent 's economic slowdown . instead , attendees of an informal meeting of eu finance ministers in nice on friday , sept .
12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.09.2008 germany , eu voice support of unity deal in zimbabwe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president mbeki -lrb- left -rrb- helped negotiate the deal with mugabe officials from the german government and the european commission offered cautious support of an announced power-sharing deal between embattled zimbabwean president robert mugabe and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed a power-sharing agreement between the main parties in zimbabwe .
" i hope this paves the way to a peaceful future , " steinmeier said .
on thursday , sept .
11 , zimbabwean president robert mugabe and movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- leader morgan tsvangirai struck a deal on forming a government of national unity , the details of which have yet to be released .
the issue now remains to tackle the southern african country 's problems , said steinmeier , adding that zimbabwe urgently needed a fresh political and economic start and germany would assess the new government on the basis of its achievements .
" i expect that a framework will soon be created in which democratic freedoms are respected and economic development becomes possible , " he said .
the view from brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political role of tsvangirai remains unclear the unity deal between the parties has forced the eu to reconsider planned moves to extend sanctions against zimbabwe .
" the european commission of course welcomes this significant step forward , " said john clancy , commission spokesman on humanitarian aid and development issues at a daily briefing on friday , sept .
12 .
after the violence that erupted in the runup to the elections in zimbabwe in march , the eu imposed travel sanctions and froze the assets of member of the ruling elite to prevent them from fleeing the country .
clancy stressed that the eu would have to review the details of the agreement before it would consider dropping sanctions or providing aid to zimbabwe .
" however we will have to wait to learn much more about this on monday , " he said .
" at this stage we are cautiously optimistic . "
praise for mbeki international observers are praising the south african president for helping to negotiate the deal after around eight weeks of stop-start talks held in both south africa and zimbabwe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the deal will affect zimbabwe is also unclear un secretary general ban ki-moon praised mbeki 's " tireless efforts to help -lrb- the zimbabwean leaders -rrb- reach it . "
" -lrb- ban -rrb- hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of zimbabwe , who have suffered for long , " the un chief 's office said in a statement .
a first round collapsed in august after tsvangirai backed away from a deal he said would have made him a toothless prime minister .
zimbabweans have been hoping for a negotiated settlement to resolve the country 's nearly decade-long political and economic crisis , blamed largely on mugabe 's populist policies . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 12.09.2008 eu observers in georgia face many hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians have announced their withdrawal and set their conditions the eu is picking up the pace .
within four weeks , 200 eu observers are slated to go to georgia .
the nature of their duties is not yet clear , but a few obstacles can already be detected . the eu wants to send at least 200 unarmed observers to georgia by oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany could send 40 observers according to the european-russian agreement from monday , sept .
8 , 2008 , russia will withdraw its troops ten days later from all of georgia – including the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .
the eu foreign ministers conference , which will meet this coming monday , sept .
15 in brussels , must first formally seal the plan and then determine the details .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu : close-knit and proactive ?
behind the scenes , preparations for the mission are running at full steam .
the center for international peace operations -lrb- zif -rrb- , which organizes the recruiting and training of the observer 's in germany , has already sent a list of 15 to 20 potential observers to the department for foreign affairs .
this list with staff suggestions will then be sent on to the european council in brussels , which will decide upon the observers at the last minute .
the zif was founded in 2002 by the federal government and the federal council in order to be able to quickly recruit candidates for foreign assignments .
observer group " overwhelmed " but the zif itself is overwhelmed by the current situation .
it wo n't be able to acquire more than 20 german observers by oct .
1 , says jens behrendt , head of the recruiting department .
the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants coopration from russia but there are observers who are also allowed to move throughout the breakaway territories .
these are a total of eight people from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russia is a member of the osce , which has been present in the caucasus since 1992 with unarmed military observers .
their goal is to prevent conflicts .
in the wake of the august military actions , the osce increased its personnel in the region .
martin nesirky , spokesperson for the osce headquarters in vienna , welcomed the eu 's involvement .
nesirky said it is a international engagement in the caucasus is a positive development .
good coordination of the observers is a prerequisite for success , however , nesirky added .
all of this must be clarified by multilateral talks . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "

12 , the basque government said it " respected " the ruling , but regarded it as undemocratic and would not " resign , " basque regional prime minister juan jose ibarretxe said .
the basque parliament had previously authorized the referendum-like vote to be staged on october 25 .
the spanish government lodged a complaint at the constitutional court , the country 's highest court alongside the supreme court .
in a unanimous ruling late thursday , sept .
11 , the court said the vote was unconstitutional , because only the spanish government had the right to authorize referendums .
the basque premier 's office immediately accused the court of partiality .
" the judiciary has let pass an opportunity to demonstrate its independence and shown once again that is penetrated by politics , " the office said a communique released overnight .

12 , the basque government said it " respected " the ruling , but regarded it as undemocratic and would not " resign , " basque regional prime minister juan jose ibarretxe said .
the basque parliament had previously authorized the referendum-like vote to be staged on october 25 .
the spanish government lodged a complaint at the constitutional court , the country 's highest court alongside the supreme court .
in a unanimous ruling late thursday , sept .
11 , the court said the vote was unconstitutional , because only the spanish government had the right to authorize referendums .
the basque premier 's office immediately accused the court of partiality .
" the judiciary has let pass an opportunity to demonstrate its independence and shown once again that is penetrated by politics , " the office said a communique released overnight .
the vote would have asked the basques whether they approved of a negotiated solution to spain 's conflict with the militant basque separatist group eta and of basque party talks on the region 's right to decide its own future .

the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .

how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .

the task of the observers is to collect information in a crisis area and report this news back to governments or multilateral organizations .
in fulfilling their duty , observers can act either passively , passing on the information they have at their disposal , or they can take a more active information-gathering role with the government , the military and civilians .
eight observers with free movement following the agreement between eu president sarkozy and the less-than-eager russian president medvedev , the eu observers can now travel to georgia , but they do n't have the right to gather information in south ossetia .
they will only be able to go as far as the buffer zone on the georgian side , and thus will only be able to paint a partial picture of the situation .

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

11 , 2001 .
his words came as nato diplomats discussed the recent events in the caucasus . looking back over the month since war broke out in the disputed georgian province of south ossetia , russian president dmitry medvedev told a group of russia experts that " the world has changed . " " almost immediately after these events it occurred to me that for russia , august 8 , 2008 was almost like september 11 , 2001 in the united states , " said medvedev at the meeting in moscow . ongoing war of words on august 8 , russian troops rolled into georgian territory in order to force back georgian troops who were trying to regain control of the breakaway province . the president 's comments came just one day after the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in the us .
they have added to the barrage of words between russian and western officials over the georgia conflict . medvedev added that nato membership for georgia would be unjust , humiliating and intolerable to moscow .
furthermore , he said russia would have invaded georgia even if it was a member of nato . nato debates its options " nato wo n't become stronger this way , global tensions wo n't be reduced .
what if georgia had a nato membership action plan ?
i would not wait for a second in making the decision i made at that time , " medvedev said . " what would the consequences be ?
they could be much worse , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's scheffer tries to reassure members among nato countries that have become increasingly concerned over the russian incursion into georgia are estonia , latvia and lithuania - all former soviet satellites . " nobody should doubt that this alliance ... will do what is necessary , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told journalists in the latvian capital riga after talks with latvian president valdis zatlers and the three baltic foreign ministers . but scheffer reiterated that the 26-nation military alliance did not consider russia a threat to its members , including the baltics . also on friday , sept .
12 , the chiefs of staff from nato 's 26 member countries met in sofia , bulgaria to discuss how the alliance should address defense issues in the wake of the georgian conflict .

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , the basque government said it " respected " the ruling , but regarded it as undemocratic and would not " resign , " basque regional prime minister juan jose ibarretxe said .
the basque parliament had previously authorized the referendum-like vote to be staged on october 25 .
the spanish government lodged a complaint at the constitutional court , the country 's highest court alongside the supreme court .
in a unanimous ruling late thursday , sept .
11 , the court said the vote was unconstitutional , because only the spanish government had the right to authorize referendums .
the basque premier 's office immediately accused the court of partiality .
" the judiciary has let pass an opportunity to demonstrate its independence and shown once again that is penetrated by politics , " the office said a communique released overnight .

11 that his country no longer had any " imperial ambitions " and dismissed fears of a new cold war with the west despite moscow issuing a warning to ukraine . war between moscow and its former soviet vassal georgia last month electrified old fears in europe , and russia 's relations with the west plunged to lows reminiscent of the cold war .
but putin sought to reassure the west of his position .
" we do not have any ideological contradictions that could serve as the basis for a new cold war , " local media quoted him as saying at a kremlin round table in russia 's black sea resort of sochi .
" quite the opposite , we have many common problems that can only be resolved together , " putin said .
crimea may be next : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's black sea fleet is based at sevastopol on the crimea peninsula french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned in the wake of the conflict that the kremlin could again resort to force to carry to term imperialist designs on ukraine 's crimean peninsula , where moscow rents a port for its black sea fleet .
but speaking to western experts at the round table thursday , putin said , " we have none of the imperialist ambitions of which we are accused . "
the former president , who once called the end of the ussr the greatest disaster ever to befall russia , said : " if it had n't been for russia , the ussr would still exist today . "
" russia initiated the end of the ussr , " putin was quoted by interfax as saying thursday .
" we made this decision a long time ago , and we do not have any desire or any intention to encroach on the sovereignty of republics of the former ussr . "
russian forces must re-arm : medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev believes russia must re-arm after georgia conflict on the ground in georgia there were increasing signs that russian forces were withdrawing in line with a pledge on monday by president dmitry medvedev after he met an eu delegation in moscow .
russian troops were expected to leave five checkpoints around the georgian port of poti and the town of senaki by monday .
an afp reporter saw soldiers packing up three posts .
but medvedev said georgia 's august 7 assault on the moscow-backed breakaway region of south ossetia meant russia would have to think about re-arming its military .
" we should concentrate on questions of military re-equipment , " medvedev said at a kremlin meeting .
" without any doubt this decision is influenced by the crisis in the caucasus , georgia 's aggression and its continued militarization . "
ukraine in russia 's scopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko ' pro-western government is in moscow 's sights international tensions over the georgia crisis flared with russia accusing ukraine 's pro-western government of taking an " unfriendly " stance over the war and of infringing the rights of russian-speaking residents .
ukraine is a strong ally of georgia .
" ukrainian authorities have recently been pursuing policies that can not be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards russia , " a strongly worded foreign ministry statement said .
western officials have expressed concern that ukraine 's large ethnic russian population could leave it exposed to intervention from moscow , with the eu 's enlargement commissioner warning ukraine could be russia 's " next target . "
putin sought to reassure the west that this was not the case .
" we do not have any desire or basis for infringing the sovereignty of former soviet republics , " the russian leader said in sochi . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu now has a little less than four weeks to find enough suitable observers .
in passau on wednesday , sept , 10 , angela merkel announced that germany could provide up to 40 observers .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has confirmed this in the meantime .
how many german observers will really set off to tiflis and what their responsibilities there will be , however , is still unclear .

12 , vowed to stick to the rules limiting the size of their budget deficits and to fight inflation by avoiding unjustified public sector wage rises .
" governments have decided not to increase their -lrb- budget -rrb- deficits because of the crisis , " said jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , at an informal meeting in the french riviera .
rather , " fiscal consolidation is necessary , " said juncker , who ran the meeting .
disappointing gdp forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker calls for " fiscal consolidation " ministers were invited to discuss the latest economic forecasts of the european commission , which now expects eurozone gross domestic product to grow by a disappointing 1.3 percent this year .
according to the commission , two of its biggest economies , germany and spain , will likely experience technical recessions - which economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
and while other heavyweights such as france and italy will not , these countries will experience virtually no growth during the second half of 2008 .
eurozone plagued by inflation the overall slowdown in the european economy comes at a time in which inflation is almost double the european central bank 's target rate of about two percent due to high oil and food prices .
unlike the 1970s , when governments responded to a similar situation by amassing huge public account debts , eurozone countries are today bound by european union rules limiting the size of their budget deficits .
however , there is growing suspicion that countries such as france and italy will not be able to stick to the budget deficit upper limit of 3 percent of gdp as a result of the crisis .
meanwhile ireland , once a eurozone success story , has become the latest member to risk breaching the eu 's stability and growth pact , its finance minister has warned .
commissioner : meeting achieved consensus with such concerns in mind , friday 's talks were designed to commit governments to stick to the rules and to cement a common response to the crisis .
and according to joaquin almunia , the eu 's monetary and economic affairs commissioner , the meeting achieved its objectives .
" some people were not convinced that ministers would be in a position to have an open discussion and come up with consensus , " almunia said .
instead , they were " one and the same in their understanding of the need to maintain the stability and growth pact , " he added .
saying ' no ' to an economic stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland may breach the stability and growth pact asked whether ministers had considered an economic stimulus package similar to the one approved in recent months by the united states administration , juncker recalled europe 's negative experience of the 1970s .
" we had a small short-term impact and a bad long-term impact in terms of increased deficits and debts , which where then passed on to the next generations . "
" i can only hope that they -lrb- us -rrb- will have more success in the medium term than when we tried it in the 1970s , " said juncker , who has chaired such eurogroup meetings since 2005 .
ministers unanimously agreed to extend his mandate by a further two years on friday .
while ruling out a contraction in germany - the commission expects the country 's yearly gdp rate to grow by 1.8 percent this year - juncker confirmed that overall european growth would remain " low in the medium term . "
and despite the recent appreciation of the dollar , he said the euro remained " overvalued . " dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 12.09.2008 beethoven 's ninth reflects will to live , says kurt masur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur conducted all nine of beethoven 's symphonies the beethovenfest in bonn celebrated one of its high points when kurt masur drew 3,000 people to a public screening in the city center .
masur told deutsche welle about interpreting beethoven for thousands . dw-tv : why did you set yourself the task of performing all nine symphonies in four days ?
kurt masur : whenever they talk about beethoven , people who think they have a musical education say : " yes he was of course a great composer , and , umm … " when they go into detail many often see beethoven as an enjoyable commodity , as interpreter of the french revolution , with a lion 's mane and violent gestures - and his humor as apparently limited .
my goal is to teach people to grasp how he began his symphonies , and today i would say you need to do it as boldly as possible .
how did you plan this cycle ?
is there some sort of arc ? of course there is an arc .
if you play symphonies one , two and three in an evening it is already a bit extravagant .
but the first two are somewhat shorter and beethoven reached his first really personal style of symphony with the third .
and that is what i want to show through this example : someone who is sitting there that evening understands perfectly that the ease , the poetry , the humor of the first has nothing to do with the third .
bildunterschrift : 3,000 people gathered in bonn 's marktplatz to watch the live public screening there is also the humanistic statement in the third , which , as we know , was originally dedicated to napoleon , but beethoven revoked the dedication in a rage because he did n't want to associate himself with an emperor or with someone who suppresses people .
the decisive question for me is to what extent do we as artists have a duty towards listeners who wants to feel the spirit of this music from the first chord ?
i have to say , at the moment with the orchestre national de france i have an uplifting orchestra .
in the rehearsals , we were often on the brink of exhaustion because the symphonies are not so easy to perform .
you ca n't play them lightly - you have to play seriously .
and you also have to take the humor seriously and master the speed at which beethoven suddenly changes the mood .
those are things that we need to bring to the audience .
otherwise they 'll just think , oh yeah , that 's the good old beethoven we already know .
do you still discover new things in beethoven 's music today ?
again and again .
we do n't know anymore how the really great soloists introduced the themes in the music .
and there are also few exceptions today .
yo-yo ma , lisa leonskaya or anne-sophie mutter - they feel something and prepare themselves inwardly for how they are going to play the next theme .
and that is enchanting to the audience .
how can one explain beethoven to people today ?
is that even possible ?
beethoven 's music is so multifaceted - there really are no human feelings that are not expressed in his music .
whether " wut ueber den verlorenen groschen " or " fuer elise " or all of those little pieces that one knows were chance compositions just to prove his talent to a pretty girl or a beautiful woman - he was in love throughout his life , we know that .
the tragedy of his life is that he first noticed that his hearing was growing weaker as he composed his second symphony .
he then wrote in the heiligenstadt testament , " oh , you people who hold me for unruly or inconvenient , i simply want to tell you that i am suffering . "
the other result was the letter to the " immortal beloved , " a farewell letter to one of the two women he 'd had contact with at that time in teplitz .
the letter was never sent , but it exists as a document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur is still going strong at 81 when i just recently performed the eighth with my orchestra in paris , i told the musicians , look , beethoven wrote the first eight symphonies over a period of around ten years .
and after the letter to the immortal beloved he did not write another big orchestra piece for about ten years .
only then did he write the missa solemnis and even later the ninth .
we have to imagine how the man felt when he really could n't hear anything anymore by this time .
he had conducted the premiere , but someone stood behind him who the orchestra and the choir could follow because beethoven himself was completely confused and no longer had control .
-lrb- he was -rrb- a man who managed to write a message for humanity at the end of his life .
he thought he was imported enough that god gave him that duty .
and it is no farewell symphony , like tchaikovsky 's sixth , which is explicitly intended as a farewell .
the last message that this sick , lonely and subdued man left us was " joy , beautiful spark of the gods . "
that is greatness .
and that also breathes life to those who only hear the music and do not know much in particular about it because they feel that , though the music is full of overcoming difficulties , melancholy and sadness , it really reflects , to the very end , the will to live .

sarkozy made waves during a visit to the vatican last year by calling for “ positive secularism ” in france .
the twice-divorced lapsed catholic suggested that religion had a place in public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has europe 's largest muslim population with his plea on friday , pope benedict continued sarkozy 's train of thought .
pope words his plea carefully speaking in fluent french before an audience of political and religious leaders at the elysee palace , the pope said it was essential “ to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of the conscience -lrb- and -rrb- the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society . ”
nonetheless , he also said it was necessary to “ insist on the distinction between the political realm and that of religion . ”
with a shortage of priests and sunday mass attendance at below 10 percent , the roman catholic church is struggling in france , despite the nation 's “ thousands of chapels , churches , abbeys and cathedrals ” that the pope noted in his speech .
religion a controversial topic in france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france : many churches , dwindling religion religion in general has become a heated topic in france , partially due to the growth of islam in the nation .
a talk given by the pope two years ago in regensburg , germany was blamed for triggering riots in muslim countries .
the 81-year-old 's comments were viewed by some as anti-islam .
although catholicism is the leading religion in france , the country also has europe 's largest muslim and jewish communities and continues to observe a 1905 law enshrining the separation of church and state . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

david kirk , director of the fraud prosecution service for england and wales , said the crime was increasing because of the credit crunch .
he called for it to be made more of a priority , with more dedicated officers deployed around britain .
ministers say police probes are improving and the number of prosecutions has been rising .
fraud is estimated to cost about £ 20 billion a year - but mr kirk told the bbc that pressures on police budgets had led to a drop in fraud squad officers from 600 to 400 over the past decade .
he said he welcomed coming improvements but believes more must be done .
" police priority for fraud investigation is low - in fact it is n't on their list of priorities , " said mr kirk .
" if you were an ordinary member of public taking your complaint about a fraud along to your local police station , you would probably find that you would not get much response - you would have to be quite lucky to get it investigated .
boiler room scams " that 's not to say that fraud squads up and down the land do n't do a fantastic job - they are some of the best officers in the police force . "
mr kirk said a great deal of fraud was now taking place in the banking sector and through " boiler room " investment schemes selling worthless shares .
" mortgage fraud has come back with a vengeance because of the credit crunch and organised crime is moving into mortgage fraud , " he added .
in 2007 , the government changed the rules over banking fraud , telling customers that banks would handle the complaints and decide whether to refer them to the police .
but figures from the attorney general show the number of cases has doubled in the two years since the launch of the fraud prosecution service - reaching 297 in the quarter to this september .
national strategy and home office minister vernon coaker said the city of london police would soon become the national lead on fraud with 40 additional officers being recruited .
" the government has allocated £ 29 million over three years to implement the recommendations of the fraud review .
" this includes the creation of a national fraud strategic authority , to start operating next month .
" a new national lead police force on fraud is being set up , through the city of london police , to lead some investigations and reinforce the policing response .
" it will provide counter-fraud specialist training , best practice and support to police forces in england and wales . "
but mr kirk added : " if you are a victim of a violent assault , that 's a terrible thing .
but it 's also awful to have your life savings stolen by a fraudulent investment scheme that will ruin the rest of your life .
it 's not a victimless crime . "

david kirk , director of the fraud prosecution service for england and wales , said the crime was increasing because of the credit crunch .
he called for it to be made more of a priority , with more dedicated officers deployed around britain .
ministers say police probes are improving and the number of prosecutions has been rising .
fraud is estimated to cost about £ 20 billion a year - but mr kirk told the bbc that pressures on police budgets had led to a drop in fraud squad officers from 600 to 400 over the past decade .
he said he welcomed coming improvements but believes more must be done .
" police priority for fraud investigation is low - in fact it is n't on their list of priorities , " said mr kirk .
" if you were an ordinary member of public taking your complaint about a fraud along to your local police station , you would probably find that you would not get much response - you would have to be quite lucky to get it investigated .
boiler room scams " that 's not to say that fraud squads up and down the land do n't do a fantastic job - they are some of the best officers in the police force . "
mr kirk said a great deal of fraud was now taking place in the banking sector and through " boiler room " investment schemes selling worthless shares .
" mortgage fraud has come back with a vengeance because of the credit crunch and organised crime is moving into mortgage fraud , " he added .
in 2007 , the government changed the rules over banking fraud , telling customers that banks would handle the complaints and decide whether to refer them to the police .
but figures from the attorney general show the number of cases has doubled in the two years since the launch of the fraud prosecution service - reaching 297 in the quarter to this september .
national strategy and home office minister vernon coaker said the city of london police would soon become the national lead on fraud with 40 additional officers being recruited .
" the government has allocated £ 29 million over three years to implement the recommendations of the fraud review .
" this includes the creation of a national fraud strategic authority , to start operating next month .
" a new national lead police force on fraud is being set up , through the city of london police , to lead some investigations and reinforce the policing response .
" it will provide counter-fraud specialist training , best practice and support to police forces in england and wales . "
but mr kirk added : " if you are a victim of a violent assault , that 's a terrible thing .
but it 's also awful to have your life savings stolen by a fraudulent investment scheme that will ruin the rest of your life .
it 's not a victimless crime . "

david kirk , director of the fraud prosecution service for england and wales , said the crime was increasing because of the credit crunch .
he called for it to be made more of a priority , with more dedicated officers deployed around britain .
ministers say police probes are improving and the number of prosecutions has been rising .
fraud is estimated to cost about £ 20 billion a year - but mr kirk told the bbc that pressures on police budgets had led to a drop in fraud squad officers from 600 to 400 over the past decade .
he said he welcomed coming improvements but believes more must be done .
" police priority for fraud investigation is low - in fact it is n't on their list of priorities , " said mr kirk .
" if you were an ordinary member of public taking your complaint about a fraud along to your local police station , you would probably find that you would not get much response - you would have to be quite lucky to get it investigated .
boiler room scams " that 's not to say that fraud squads up and down the land do n't do a fantastic job - they are some of the best officers in the police force . "
mr kirk said a great deal of fraud was now taking place in the banking sector and through " boiler room " investment schemes selling worthless shares .
" mortgage fraud has come back with a vengeance because of the credit crunch and organised crime is moving into mortgage fraud , " he added .
in 2007 , the government changed the rules over banking fraud , telling customers that banks would handle the complaints and decide whether to refer them to the police .
but figures from the attorney general show the number of cases has doubled in the two years since the launch of the fraud prosecution service - reaching 297 in the quarter to this september .
national strategy and home office minister vernon coaker said the city of london police would soon become the national lead on fraud with 40 additional officers being recruited .
" the government has allocated £ 29 million over three years to implement the recommendations of the fraud review .
" this includes the creation of a national fraud strategic authority , to start operating next month .
" a new national lead police force on fraud is being set up , through the city of london police , to lead some investigations and reinforce the policing response .
" it will provide counter-fraud specialist training , best practice and support to police forces in england and wales . "
but mr kirk added : " if you are a victim of a violent assault , that 's a terrible thing .
but it 's also awful to have your life savings stolen by a fraudulent investment scheme that will ruin the rest of your life .
it 's not a victimless crime . "

under the agreement , from october google will sell ads alongside yahoo search results on some of its pages .
rumours the us justice department would challenge the deal grew this week when it hired a veteran anti-trust lawyer .
hilary schneider , executive vice-president of yahoo us , told the bbc the agreement was " fully within the guidelines of the law " .
both companies voluntarily agreed to have the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- examine the plan , which was announced in june .
they also committed themselves to wait three and a half months to give regulators time to scrutinise it .
google 's chief executive eric schmidt recently said both companies were aiming to go forward with the deal .
now yahoo has said even if the plan is not cleared by regulators , it will go ahead as planned .
" we are confident the agreement makes sense .
we are committed to moving ahead , " said ms schneider .
" remember this is a voluntary process we engaged in and we think it 's really working in terms of helping the department of justice understand the issues . "
competition yahoo co-founder david filo added his voice to the debate and said he believed despite mounting criticism and talk of an anti-trust investigation , the doj would give its approval .
" we went to them -lrb- the doj -rrb- pro-actively and said ' let 's go through a review ' .
we have done that and we are confident that all parties will agree this is good for competition in the long term .
and so we are expecting them to agree with that . "
not everyone believes the us government should give its blessing .
microsoft , which failed in its bid to buy yahoo for $ 47.5bn -lrb- £ 27bn -rrb- earlier in 2008 , has said it feared the partnership would reduce competition in the search advertising market .
the association of national advertisers , which represents major marketers , has also asked the doj to block the deal .
around a dozen states , including california , have all raised questions about the matter .
combined , yahoo and google control more than 80 % of the us search advertising market .
yahoo expects to boost its annual revenue by $ 800 million -lrb- £ 455m -rrb- as a result of the deal .
open strategy yahoo 's comments were made at an event to discuss its strategy to open its technology to third party developers .
it is seen as key to turning the company around , after share prices plummeted to a five-year low of $ 17.85 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- , well below the $ 33 -lrb- £ 19 -rrb- a share offered by microsoft .
" it cuts across everything we are doing , " said mr filo of moves to invite third party developers " to develop on top of our stuff , to be innovative and drive the market " .
" it is pretty vital to our future success .
i mean without it we are just not going to have the richness of products and services you will see if we do n't open up . "
over the next couple of months yahoo has said it will make changes to several popular sections of its website to accommodate more material from rival services as well as extend its advertising network so it can run ads on more internet properties .
the homepage will also be redesigned for the first time since 2006 to make it easier for users to tap into third party services or widgets .
the company also plans to open up its music section to rival services like apple 's itunes and amazon in the new few weeks .
and the news section will also start to feature more local content .
efforts are also being made to open up the e-mail system , which is the world 's largest with upwards of 275 million users .
and developers are being encouraged to use yahoo 's blueprint platform to develop mobile applications .
yahoo 's chief technology officer ari balogh told bbc news the company 's 500 + million users means yahoo can spur innovation not just for yahoo but potentially for the whole of the web .
" open is literally the way we are going to unlock a lot of the value of yahoo 's assets and allow developers from across the web to build on yahoo as well as take parts of yahoo out .
" we think there are industry changing things we can do .
it has certainly been a tumultuous time for yahoo in the press and externally , but i think the thing people should take away is that we are continuing to innovate and to push the edge . "

under the agreement , from october google will sell ads alongside yahoo search results on some of its pages .
rumours the us justice department would challenge the deal grew this week when it hired a veteran anti-trust lawyer .
hilary schneider , executive vice-president of yahoo us , told the bbc the agreement was " fully within the guidelines of the law " .
both companies voluntarily agreed to have the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- examine the plan , which was announced in june .
they also committed themselves to wait three and a half months to give regulators time to scrutinise it .
google 's chief executive eric schmidt recently said both companies were aiming to go forward with the deal .
david filo said the company has worked closely with the justice dept now yahoo has said even if the plan is not cleared by regulators , it will go ahead as planned .
" we are confident the agreement makes sense .
we are committed to moving ahead , " said ms schneider .
" remember this is a voluntary process we engaged in and we think it 's really working in terms of helping the department of justice understand the issues . "
competition yahoo co-founder david filo added his voice to the debate and said he believed despite mounting criticism and talk of an anti-trust investigation , the doj would give its approval .
" we went to them -lrb- the doj -rrb- pro-actively and said ' let 's go through a review ' .
we have done that and we are confident that all parties will agree this is good for competition in the long term .
and so we are expecting them to agree with that . "
not everyone believes the us government should give its blessing .
microsoft , which failed in its bid to buy yahoo for $ 47.5bn -lrb- £ 27bn -rrb- earlier in 2008 , has said it feared the partnership would reduce competition in the search advertising market .
yahoo 's share price is well below the $ 33 microsoft offered in the summer the association of national advertisers , which represents major marketers , has also asked the doj to block the deal .
around a dozen states , including california , have all raised questions about the matter .
combined , yahoo and google control more than 80 % of the us search advertising market .
yahoo expects to boost its annual revenue by $ 800 million -lrb- £ 455m -rrb- as a result of the deal .
open strategy yahoo 's comments were made at an event to discuss its strategy to open its technology to third party developers .
it is seen as key to turning the company around , after share prices plummeted to a five-year low of $ 17.85 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- , well below the $ 33 -lrb- £ 19 -rrb- a share offered by microsoft .
" it cuts across everything we are doing , " said mr filo of moves to invite third party developers " to develop on top of our stuff , to be innovative and drive the market " .
" it is pretty vital to our future success .
i mean without it we are just not going to have the richness of products and services you will see if we do n't open up . "
over the next couple of months yahoo has said it will make changes to several popular sections of its website to accommodate more material from rival services as well as extend its advertising network so it can run ads on more internet properties .
the homepage will also be redesigned for the first time since 2006 to make it easier for users to tap into third party services or widgets .
yahoo is trying to attract developers to create new mobile applications the company also plans to open up its music section to rival services like apple 's itunes and amazon in the new few weeks .
and the news section will also start to feature more local content .
efforts are also being made to open up the e-mail system , which is the world 's largest with upwards of 275 million users .
and developers are being encouraged to use yahoo 's blueprint platform to develop mobile applications .
yahoo 's chief technology officer ari balogh told bbc news the company 's 500 + million users means yahoo can spur innovation not just for yahoo but potentially for the whole of the web .
" open is literally the way we are going to unlock a lot of the value of yahoo 's assets and allow developers from across the web to build on yahoo as well as take parts of yahoo out .
" we think there are industry changing things we can do .
it has certainly been a tumultuous time for yahoo in the press and externally , but i think the thing people should take away is that we are continuing to innovate and to push the edge . "

under the agreement , from october google will sell ads alongside yahoo search results on some of its pages .
rumours the us justice department would challenge the deal grew this week when it hired a veteran anti-trust lawyer .
hilary schneider , executive vice-president of yahoo us , told the bbc the agreement was " fully within the guidelines of the law " .
both companies voluntarily agreed to have the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- examine the plan , which was announced in june .
they also committed themselves to wait three and a half months to give regulators time to scrutinise it .
google 's chief executive eric schmidt recently said both companies were aiming to go forward with the deal .
david filo said the company has worked closely with the justice dept now yahoo has said even if the plan is not cleared by regulators , it will go ahead as planned .
" we are confident the agreement makes sense .
we are committed to moving ahead , " said ms schneider .
" remember this is a voluntary process we engaged in and we think it 's really working in terms of helping the department of justice understand the issues . "
competition yahoo co-founder david filo added his voice to the debate and said he believed despite mounting criticism and talk of an anti-trust investigation , the doj would give its approval .
" we went to them -lrb- the doj -rrb- pro-actively and said ' let 's go through a review ' .
we have done that and we are confident that all parties will agree this is good for competition in the long term .
and so we are expecting them to agree with that . "
not everyone believes the us government should give its blessing .
microsoft , which failed in its bid to buy yahoo for $ 47.5bn -lrb- £ 27bn -rrb- earlier in 2008 , has said it feared the partnership would reduce competition in the search advertising market .
yahoo 's share price is well below the $ 33 microsoft offered in the summer the association of national advertisers , which represents major marketers , has also asked the doj to block the deal .
around a dozen states , including california , have all raised questions about the matter .
combined , yahoo and google control more than 80 % of the us search advertising market .
yahoo expects to boost its annual revenue by $ 800 million -lrb- £ 455m -rrb- as a result of the deal .
open strategy yahoo 's comments were made at an event to discuss its strategy to open its technology to third party developers .
it is seen as key to turning the company around , after share prices plummeted to a five-year low of $ 17.85 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- , well below the $ 33 -lrb- £ 19 -rrb- a share offered by microsoft .
" it cuts across everything we are doing , " said mr filo of moves to invite third party developers " to develop on top of our stuff , to be innovative and drive the market " .
" it is pretty vital to our future success .
i mean without it we are just not going to have the richness of products and services you will see if we do n't open up . "
over the next couple of months yahoo has said it will make changes to several popular sections of its website to accommodate more material from rival services as well as extend its advertising network so it can run ads on more internet properties .
the homepage will also be redesigned for the first time since 2006 to make it easier for users to tap into third party services or widgets .
yahoo is trying to attract developers to create new mobile applications the company also plans to open up its music section to rival services like apple 's itunes and amazon in the new few weeks .
and the news section will also start to feature more local content .
efforts are also being made to open up the e-mail system , which is the world 's largest with upwards of 275 million users .
and developers are being encouraged to use yahoo 's blueprint platform to develop mobile applications .
yahoo 's chief technology officer ari balogh told bbc news the company 's 500 + million users means yahoo can spur innovation not just for yahoo but potentially for the whole of the web .
" open is literally the way we are going to unlock a lot of the value of yahoo 's assets and allow developers from across the web to build on yahoo as well as take parts of yahoo out .
" we think there are industry changing things we can do .
it has certainly been a tumultuous time for yahoo in the press and externally , but i think the thing people should take away is that we are continuing to innovate and to push the edge . "

under the agreement , from october google will sell ads alongside yahoo search results on some of its pages .
rumours the us justice department would challenge the deal grew this week when it hired a veteran anti-trust lawyer .
hilary schneider , executive vice-president of yahoo us , told the bbc the agreement was " fully within the guidelines of the law " .
both companies voluntarily agreed to have the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- examine the plan , which was announced in june .
they also committed themselves to wait three and a half months to give regulators time to scrutinise it .
google 's chief executive eric schmidt recently said both companies were aiming to go forward with the deal .
david filo said the company has worked closely with the justice dept now yahoo has said even if the plan is not cleared by regulators , it will go ahead as planned .
" we are confident the agreement makes sense .
we are committed to moving ahead , " said ms schneider .
" remember this is a voluntary process we engaged in and we think it 's really working in terms of helping the department of justice understand the issues . "
competition yahoo co-founder david filo added his voice to the debate and said he believed despite mounting criticism and talk of an anti-trust investigation , the doj would give its approval .
" we went to them -lrb- the doj -rrb- pro-actively and said ' let 's go through a review ' .
we have done that and we are confident that all parties will agree this is good for competition in the long term .
and so we are expecting them to agree with that . "
not everyone believes the us government should give its blessing .
microsoft , which failed in its bid to buy yahoo for $ 47.5bn -lrb- £ 27bn -rrb- earlier in 2008 , has said it feared the partnership would reduce competition in the search advertising market .
yahoo 's share price is well below the $ 33 microsoft offered in the summer the association of national advertisers , which represents major marketers , has also asked the doj to block the deal .
around a dozen states , including california , have all raised questions about the matter .
combined , yahoo and google control more than 80 % of the us search advertising market .
yahoo expects to boost its annual revenue by $ 800 million -lrb- £ 455m -rrb- as a result of the deal .
open strategy yahoo 's comments were made at an event to discuss its strategy to open its technology to third party developers .
it is seen as key to turning the company around , after share prices plummeted to a five-year low of $ 17.85 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- , well below the $ 33 -lrb- £ 19 -rrb- a share offered by microsoft .
" it cuts across everything we are doing , " said mr filo of moves to invite third party developers " to develop on top of our stuff , to be innovative and drive the market " .
" it is pretty vital to our future success .
i mean without it we are just not going to have the richness of products and services you will see if we do n't open up . "
over the next couple of months yahoo has said it will make changes to several popular sections of its website to accommodate more material from rival services as well as extend its advertising network so it can run ads on more internet properties .
the homepage will also be redesigned for the first time since 2006 to make it easier for users to tap into third party services or widgets .
yahoo is trying to attract developers to create new mobile applications the company also plans to open up its music section to rival services like apple 's itunes and amazon in the new few weeks .
and the news section will also start to feature more local content .
efforts are also being made to open up the e-mail system , which is the world 's largest with upwards of 275 million users .
and developers are being encouraged to use yahoo 's blueprint platform to develop mobile applications .
yahoo 's chief technology officer ari balogh told bbc news the company 's 500 + million users means yahoo can spur innovation not just for yahoo but potentially for the whole of the web .
" open is literally the way we are going to unlock a lot of the value of yahoo 's assets and allow developers from across the web to build on yahoo as well as take parts of yahoo out .
" we think there are industry changing things we can do .
it has certainly been a tumultuous time for yahoo in the press and externally , but i think the thing people should take away is that we are continuing to innovate and to push the edge . "

the comments are in response to a report from the welsh assembly 's broadcasting committee .
the minister said wales was " an invisible nation " on british television .
he echoes a bbc review which is looking into how wales is covered by network programmes following concerns .
mr jones 's statement will increase the pressure on broadcasters to increase network production in wales .
mr jones demanded that channel four as well as the bbc should commit to spending at least 5 % of their network budgets in wales .
while praising series like doctor who and torchwood he said that they needed to be part of much wider production base .
mr jones also backed a committee recommendation that consideration should be given to a separate itv licence for wales .
however , the assembly government has rejected suggestions that the assembly should appoint the chair of s4c and the bbc 's welsh trustee , as well as calls for s4c to develop more english-language provision .

advertisement principality chief executive peter griffiths speaks with bbc wales business correspondent nick servini profits at wales ' biggest building society the principality have halved over the past year .
but the lender said its performance compares favourably with other building societies across the uk .
pre-tax profits are £ 8.4m - which is half what they were this time last year .
it has blamed difficult times at its estate agency peter alan , where business is down dramatically , as well as its secured loans business nemo .
the building society has described its performance as solid during a period of uncertainty for the financial services sector .
peter griffiths , the group chief executive of principality , said : " the first half of 2008 has been a period of considerable turbulence and uncertainty for the financial services sector . "
the society says there have been record levels of savings and new customers .
it also stresses that nearly 90 % of its mortgages are funded internally , reducing its exposure to risk on the wholesale money markets .
the society says its retail savings balances have increased by £ 446.7m to £ 4,251m and its assets have gone up by £ 427m to £ 6,289.5m.
the principality also says its group arrears are better than the industry average .

he sings in yiddish .
he dresses in the clothes of a haredi jew and all of his song lyrics come from the scriptures .
yet some say schmeltzer 's music , and that of others like him , is indecent and unfit for public consumption .
" they are leading the public astray and are causing a great negative influence on the young generation , " says rabbi efraim luft , head of an ultra-orthodox organisation in israel called the committee for jewish music .
supported by leading haredi rabbis , rabbi luft has drawn up a black-list of musicians and bands - music that he says that is not kosher and can not be played at ultra-orthodox weddings or public events because of its decadent nature .
what rabbi luft objects to so vehemently is not just contemporary , western music - rock , rap or pop - but the use of modern instruments and beats in the tunes of orthodox singers like lipa schmeltzer .
" the main part of the music should be the melody .
percussion should be secondary .
they should not bend notes electronically and should not use instruments like electric guitars , bass guitars or saxophones in jewish music , " he says .
sitting in the dining room of his small flat in the orthodox town of bnei brak , close to tel aviv , rabbi luft explains his preference for traditional , even sombre , jewish tunes like kol nidrei .
a serious , studious man the rabbi explains how he thinks modern music is disrespectful , leading young people astray and can lead to the collapse of education and the family system . "
the use of percussion accompaniment in slow , quiet music is generally ridiculous .
2/4 beats and other rock and disco beats must not be used " rules for playing kosher music , committee for jewish music most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader it is a broad charge , but the rabbi is convinced that in the last 25 years music has gradually eroded moral standing in society .
saying that music is " powerful " , he says the " purpose of modern music - its influences - is to distract young people and change good characters into bad " .
the rabbi says such music , even jewish rock music , " where the dangerous beat plays more of a part than the melody , has no place in a society where people are trying to keep their moral standards high .
concerts banned there are approximately 500,000 ultra-orthodox haredi jews in israel .
they tend to live in their own communities in , or near israel 's major towns .
their plain , modest clothing , rituals and centuries-old customs make the haredis unmistakable and their lives revolve around their faith .
because of the loyal relationship between orthodox jews and their rabbis , the influence of bodies like the committee for jewish music and the guardians of sanctity and education is considerable . "
" if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people " " menahem toker they have already succeeded in banning virtually all public concerts by ultra-orthodox groups and singers in israel .
famous , successful singers like avraham fried - a devout , observant orthodox jew - are not exempt .
making up around 8 % of the population of israel , the haredi community has real economic clout .
boycotts have been very effective .
menahem toker , an award-winning disc jockey , who was dismissed from a radio show under pressure from haredi activists , warns the policy could backfire .
" in jewish orthodox culture there 's no cinema , no theatre , no television .
the only thing we have is music " , says mr toker .
" we are the same , orthodox , people but if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people - they 'll go to non-kosher shows and they 'll have lost the next generation . "
it is a dire warning from a man who cares deeply about his religion and his music - but the hard-line rabbis are unapologetic .
in a world bursting with mobile phones , mp4 players and dvds they say it is their moral duty to protect young people against the evils of the modern world .
here is a selection of your comments : as orthodox jews , my husband and i listen to a wide variety of music .
i do not think either of our musical preferences in any way corrupts our morals .
rather , i believe the music we listen to gives voice to how we are feeling or how we wish to feel .
on a more important note , music can be used as a tool for reaching unaffiliated jews .
for instance , my mother-in-law uses the melodies from contemporary songs and adds jewish themes to teach her jewish kindergarten class - many of whom do not come from religious homes .
i believe that by restricting what music can be heard , the ultra orthodox are missing out on a fundamental tool which could be used to bridge the gap between religious and secular jews .
maya bahar , stamford , ct music is extremely powerful , and can affect people at a conscious -lrb- ie aware -rrb- , as well as sub-conscious level .
i 've changed my listening habits as i 've changed as a person .
in my wild and rebellious youth , it was all rap , and hip-hop .
now it 's calmer , gentler stuff , where it 's less about the rhythm , and more about the melody .
the rabbis clearly do know what they 're talking about , although i hope they allow their listeners to buy music of better quality than the first clip above .
r. e. brown , london as a muslim , i support the rabbi 's decision , finally they are thinking like conservative muslims ; after all muslims and jews are very much alike .
majority of modern music is immoral and degrading the faith .
zuber iraqi , louisville , ky i find this article extremely interesting .
i do n't think anyone can dispute the effect music has on the listener .
film makers have been using these music / sound techniques for many years .
music can put you into a scared , tense , happy and sad state .
as such it could probably be equal to any substance , where limits have to be put and overdoses of the wrong style could bring about negative results .
chulent fresser , kish mech , israel the jewish orthodox community have shown to me and others that the jewish faith often has a lot to share with the muslim faith .
the psychological effect of music and the message is contained is contaminating a lot of minds and causing a great deal of moral destruction .
muslims , jews , christians and everybody else should work together to reduce its influence in a world of deteriorating morality .
i applaud the strength of these orthodox jews to hold on to their faith and prevent the evils of music from corrupting yet more minds .
hassan , manchester , uk i think the rabbis do have a valid point to a certain extent .
but ban this music from our kids of today and they will turn to even more non-kosher sources for their entertainment .
besides , i am sure that 20-30 years ago the older generation were the saying the same of the then ' modern music ' .
steven kahn , london ; uk bonkers , they 're going bonkers .
it 's a good job they do n't listen to ' slayer ' ...
greg edelston , be-er sheva , israel i as an orthodox jew agree 100 % percent with the rabbi 's ruling although i am sure that somebody not jewish thinks it crazy , they ca n't understand our way we educate our kids , to be calm and respecting , and the fact is clear that this music interferes very strongly and has a very negative effect .
moshe davis , london another good example of the religious communities ' desire to alienate themselves from mainstream israeli society , and its culture which they seem to find an abomination .
no problem there , however they live here producing nothing towards the nation 's wealth , and yet criticise and pour scorn on all us secular jews .
gidon bennett , tel aviv israel as a jewish person , i find it remarkable that someone in the 21st century wants to repel any outside source or inspiration .
the haredi really do not resemble or reflect the majority of jewish people at all .
they are outdated and as much fanatics -lrb- although thankfully not violent -rrb- as any other sect .
in my opinion , they are missing out on loads and alienating their own !
william brown , uk everything must be taken in context .
the rabbi was speaking to the ' haredi ' people who live in a certain way within their communities .
to listen to ' modern ' music is changing a tradition of thousands of years , tradition being key to the jewish people .
in addition , it is clear that the style and beat of music affects people .
certain music cheers people up , others make people sad and others rouse people to become wild .
anyone who says that music has no affect on the listener is deluding themselves .
moshe kormornick , jerusalem music contains spiritual components and therefore it is important to give guidance to youth .
great rabbis have in the past given rulings about this subject , as jewish law covers all aspects of life .
rabbi schmahl , antwerp belgium censorship on lyrics is one thing , but when a society starts banning certain types of music or instruments , i am very , very concerned ...
valérie peters , podgorica , montenegro it 's good to know that fundamentalist rock-and-roll alarmism is n't just an american phenomenon .
justin anthony knapp , indianapolis , usa the rabbi is absolutely correct about the powerful influence music has on behaviour .
i am a bible-believing christian in a predominantly hindu / buddhist nation .
i used to love rock music and its beat and even played in bands .
music is certainly not amoral .
even if the lyrics are from the scriptures , if the music has , say , the rock beat , the chief human response is physical , not spiritual .
but when the spiritually-minded david played his harp before a mentally-spiritually depressed king saul , it had a most healthful influence upon not only his body but also his soul and spirit -lrb- 1 samuel 16:23 -rrb- .
pradesh shrestha , palung , nepal once upon a time , there was a group of people determined to control what the people could or could not read , watch and hear .
anything that did not fit with their view of ' decent ' , ' upstanding ' and ' respectable ' , was banned , leading to large-scale book-burnings .
that group of people later went on to ban and burn more than books .
" where they burn books , they will ultimately also burn people . " - heinrich heine jamie jones , linz , austria the rabbi 's attempted censorship of music because of beat or instrument choice rather than content is silly , and i think that he is exploiting his supposed religious authority to enforce his specific taste in music on the haredi public .
it will only cause division and ridicule , but it brings him celebrity , which is certainly " non-kosher " .
unlike the pop tunes and wedding songs which are a reasonable " kosher " replacement for decadent popular culture , the " modern " kol nidre is equally silly ; it completely lacks the power that the traditional cantorial version holds for millions of jews as the symbol of the beginning of the annual " judgement day " , yom kippur .
binyamin , eilat , israel it is obvious that a large segment of the music consumed by western youth is indecent and disrespectful -lrb- eg gangsta rap -rrb- .
even if the rabbi is going a step too far , we should not laugh at his notion but accept it as some food for thought .

sitting in the dining room of his small flat in the orthodox town of bnei brak , close to tel aviv , rabbi luft explains his preference for traditional , even sombre , jewish tunes like kol nidrei .

saying that music is " powerful " , he says the " purpose of modern music - its influences - is to distract young people and change good characters into bad " .
the rabbi says such music , even jewish rock music , " where the dangerous beat plays more of a part than the melody , has no place in a society where people are trying to keep their moral standards high .
concerts banned there are approximately 500,000 ultra-orthodox haredi jews in israel .
they tend to live in their own communities in , or near israel 's major towns .
their plain , modest clothing , rituals and centuries-old customs make the haredis unmistakable and their lives revolve around their faith .
because of the loyal relationship between orthodox jews and their rabbis , the influence of bodies like the committee for jewish music and the guardians of sanctity and education is considerable .
" if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people " menahem toker they have already succeeded in banning virtually all public concerts by ultra-orthodox groups and singers in israel .

rather , i believe the music we listen to gives voice to how we are feeling or how we wish to feel .
on a more important note , music can be used as a tool for reaching unaffiliated jews .
for instance , my mother-in-law uses the melodies from contemporary songs and adds jewish themes to teach her jewish kindergarten class - many of whom do not come from religious homes .

" they are leading the public astray and are causing a great negative influence on the young generation , " says rabbi efraim luft , head of an ultra-orthodox organisation in israel called the committee for jewish music .
supported by leading haredi rabbis , rabbi luft has drawn up a black-list of musicians and bands - music that he says that is not kosher and can not be played at ultra-orthodox weddings or public events because of its decadent nature .

what rabbi luft objects to so vehemently is not just contemporary , western music - rock , rap or pop - but the use of modern instruments and beats in the tunes of orthodox singers like lipa schmeltzer .
" the main part of the music should be the melody .
percussion should be secondary .
they should not bend notes electronically and should not use instruments like electric guitars , bass guitars or saxophones in jewish music , " he says .

sitting in the dining room of his small flat in the orthodox town of bnei brak , close to tel aviv , rabbi luft explains his preference for traditional , even sombre , jewish tunes like kol nidrei .
a serious , studious man the rabbi explains how he thinks modern music is disrespectful , leading young people astray and can lead to the collapse of education and the family system .
the use of percussion accompaniment in slow , quiet music is generally ridiculous .
2/4 beats and other rock and disco beats must not be used rules for playing kosher music , committee for jewish music most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here it is a broad charge , but the rabbi is convinced that in the last 25 years music has gradually eroded moral standing in society .
saying that music is " powerful " , he says the " purpose of modern music - its influences - is to distract young people and change good characters into bad " .
the rabbi says such music , even jewish rock music , " where the dangerous beat plays more of a part than the melody , has no place in a society where people are trying to keep their moral standards high .
concerts banned there are approximately 500,000 ultra-orthodox haredi jews in israel .
they tend to live in their own communities in , or near israel 's major towns .
their plain , modest clothing , rituals and centuries-old customs make the haredis unmistakable and their lives revolve around their faith .
because of the loyal relationship between orthodox jews and their rabbis , the influence of bodies like the committee for jewish music and the guardians of sanctity and education is considerable .
" if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people " menahem toker they have already succeeded in banning virtually all public concerts by ultra-orthodox groups and singers in israel .
famous , successful singers like avraham fried - a devout , observant orthodox jew - are not exempt .
making up around 8 % of the population of israel , the haredi community has real economic clout .
boycotts have been very effective .
menahem toker , an award-winning disc jockey , who was dismissed from a radio show under pressure from haredi activists , warns the policy could backfire .
" in jewish orthodox culture there 's no cinema , no theatre , no television .
the only thing we have is music " , says mr toker .
" we are the same , orthodox , people but if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people - they 'll go to non-kosher shows and they 'll have lost the next generation . "
it is a dire warning from a man who cares deeply about his religion and his music - but the hard-line rabbis are unapologetic .
in a world bursting with mobile phones , mp4 players and dvds they say it is their moral duty to protect young people against the evils of the modern world .
here is a selection of your comments : as orthodox jews , my husband and i listen to a wide variety of music .
i do not think either of our musical preferences in any way corrupts our morals .
rather , i believe the music we listen to gives voice to how we are feeling or how we wish to feel .
on a more important note , music can be used as a tool for reaching unaffiliated jews .
for instance , my mother-in-law uses the melodies from contemporary songs and adds jewish themes to teach her jewish kindergarten class - many of whom do not come from religious homes .
i believe that by restricting what music can be heard , the ultra orthodox are missing out on a fundamental tool which could be used to bridge the gap between religious and secular jews .

" they are leading the public astray and are causing a great negative influence on the young generation , " says rabbi efraim luft , head of an ultra-orthodox organisation in israel called the committee for jewish music .
supported by leading haredi rabbis , rabbi luft has drawn up a black-list of musicians and bands - music that he says that is not kosher and can not be played at ultra-orthodox weddings or public events because of its decadent nature .

what rabbi luft objects to so vehemently is not just contemporary , western music - rock , rap or pop - but the use of modern instruments and beats in the tunes of orthodox singers like lipa schmeltzer .
" the main part of the music should be the melody .
percussion should be secondary .
they should not bend notes electronically and should not use instruments like electric guitars , bass guitars or saxophones in jewish music , " he says .

sitting in the dining room of his small flat in the orthodox town of bnei brak , close to tel aviv , rabbi luft explains his preference for traditional , even sombre , jewish tunes like kol nidrei .
a serious , studious man the rabbi explains how he thinks modern music is disrespectful , leading young people astray and can lead to the collapse of education and the family system .
the use of percussion accompaniment in slow , quiet music is generally ridiculous .
2/4 beats and other rock and disco beats must not be used rules for playing kosher music , committee for jewish music most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here it is a broad charge , but the rabbi is convinced that in the last 25 years music has gradually eroded moral standing in society .
saying that music is " powerful " , he says the " purpose of modern music - its influences - is to distract young people and change good characters into bad " .
the rabbi says such music , even jewish rock music , " where the dangerous beat plays more of a part than the melody , has no place in a society where people are trying to keep their moral standards high .
concerts banned there are approximately 500,000 ultra-orthodox haredi jews in israel .
they tend to live in their own communities in , or near israel 's major towns .
their plain , modest clothing , rituals and centuries-old customs make the haredis unmistakable and their lives revolve around their faith .
because of the loyal relationship between orthodox jews and their rabbis , the influence of bodies like the committee for jewish music and the guardians of sanctity and education is considerable .
" if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people " menahem toker they have already succeeded in banning virtually all public concerts by ultra-orthodox groups and singers in israel .
famous , successful singers like avraham fried - a devout , observant orthodox jew - are not exempt .
making up around 8 % of the population of israel , the haredi community has real economic clout .
boycotts have been very effective .
menahem toker , an award-winning disc jockey , who was dismissed from a radio show under pressure from haredi activists , warns the policy could backfire .
" in jewish orthodox culture there 's no cinema , no theatre , no television .
the only thing we have is music " , says mr toker .
" we are the same , orthodox , people but if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people - they 'll go to non-kosher shows and they 'll have lost the next generation . "
it is a dire warning from a man who cares deeply about his religion and his music - but the hard-line rabbis are unapologetic .
in a world bursting with mobile phones , mp4 players and dvds they say it is their moral duty to protect young people against the evils of the modern world .
here is a selection of your comments : as orthodox jews , my husband and i listen to a wide variety of music .
i do not think either of our musical preferences in any way corrupts our morals .
rather , i believe the music we listen to gives voice to how we are feeling or how we wish to feel .
on a more important note , music can be used as a tool for reaching unaffiliated jews .
for instance , my mother-in-law uses the melodies from contemporary songs and adds jewish themes to teach her jewish kindergarten class - many of whom do not come from religious homes .
i believe that by restricting what music can be heard , the ultra orthodox are missing out on a fundamental tool which could be used to bridge the gap between religious and secular jews .
maya bahar , stamford , ct music is extremely powerful , and can affect people at a conscious -lrb- ie aware -rrb- , as well as sub-conscious level .
i 've changed my listening habits as i 've changed as a person .
in my wild and rebellious youth , it was all rap , and hip-hop .
now it 's calmer , gentler stuff , where it 's less about the rhythm , and more about the melody .
the rabbis clearly do know what they 're talking about , although i hope they allow their listeners to buy music of better quality than the first clip above .
r. e. brown , london as a muslim , i support the rabbi 's decision , finally they are thinking like conservative muslims ; after all muslims and jews are very much alike .
majority of modern music is immoral and degrading the faith .
zuber iraqi , louisville , ky i find this article extremely interesting .
i do n't think anyone can dispute the effect music has on the listener .
film makers have been using these music / sound techniques for many years .
music can put you into a scared , tense , happy and sad state .
as such it could probably be equal to any substance , where limits have to be put and overdoses of the wrong style could bring about negative results .
chulent fresser , kish mech , israel the jewish orthodox community have shown to me and others that the jewish faith often has a lot to share with the muslim faith .
the psychological effect of music and the message is contained is contaminating a lot of minds and causing a great deal of moral destruction .
muslims , jews , christians and everybody else should work together to reduce its influence in a world of deteriorating morality .
i applaud the strength of these orthodox jews to hold on to their faith and prevent the evils of music from corrupting yet more minds .
hassan , manchester , uk i think the rabbis do have a valid point to a certain extent .
but ban this music from our kids of today and they will turn to even more non-kosher sources for their entertainment .
besides , i am sure that 20-30 years ago the older generation were the saying the same of the then ' modern music ' .
steven kahn , london ; uk bonkers , they 're going bonkers .
it 's a good job they do n't listen to ' slayer ' ...

moshe davis , london another good example of the religious communities ' desire to alienate themselves from mainstream israeli society , and its culture which they seem to find an abomination .
no problem there , however they live here producing nothing towards the nation 's wealth , and yet criticise and pour scorn on all us secular jews .
gidon bennett , tel aviv israel as a jewish person , i find it remarkable that someone in the 21st century wants to repel any outside source or inspiration .
the haredi really do not resemble or reflect the majority of jewish people at all .
they are outdated and as much fanatics -lrb- although thankfully not violent -rrb- as any other sect .
in my opinion , they are missing out on loads and alienating their own !

he sings in yiddish .
he dresses in the clothes of a haredi jew and all of his song lyrics come from the scriptures .
yet some say schmeltzer 's music , and that of others like him , is indecent and unfit for public consumption .

" they are leading the public astray and are causing a great negative influence on the young generation , " says rabbi efraim luft , head of an ultra-orthodox organisation in israel called the committee for jewish music .
supported by leading haredi rabbis , rabbi luft has drawn up a black-list of musicians and bands - music that he says that is not kosher and can not be played at ultra-orthodox weddings or public events because of its decadent nature .

media requires javascript to play .
what rabbi luft objects to so vehemently is not just contemporary , western music - rock , rap or pop - but the use of modern instruments and beats in the tunes of orthodox singers like lipa schmeltzer .
" the main part of the music should be the melody .
percussion should be secondary .
they should not bend notes electronically and should not use instruments like electric guitars , bass guitars or saxophones in jewish music , " he says .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
sitting in the dining room of his small flat in the orthodox town of bnei brak , close to tel aviv , rabbi luft explains his preference for traditional , even sombre , jewish tunes like kol nidrei .
a serious , studious man the rabbi explains how he thinks modern music is disrespectful , leading young people astray and can lead to the collapse of education and the family system .
the use of percussion accompaniment in slow , quiet music is generally ridiculous .
2/4 beats and other rock and disco beats must not be used rules for playing kosher music , committee for jewish music most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here it is a broad charge , but the rabbi is convinced that in the last 25 years music has gradually eroded moral standing in society .
saying that music is " powerful " , he says the " purpose of modern music - its influences - is to distract young people and change good characters into bad " .
the rabbi says such music , even jewish rock music , " where the dangerous beat plays more of a part than the melody , has no place in a society where people are trying to keep their moral standards high .
concerts banned there are approximately 500,000 ultra-orthodox haredi jews in israel .
they tend to live in their own communities in , or near israel 's major towns .
their plain , modest clothing , rituals and centuries-old customs make the haredis unmistakable and their lives revolve around their faith .
because of the loyal relationship between orthodox jews and their rabbis , the influence of bodies like the committee for jewish music and the guardians of sanctity and education is considerable .
" if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people " menahem toker they have already succeeded in banning virtually all public concerts by ultra-orthodox groups and singers in israel .
famous , successful singers like avraham fried - a devout , observant orthodox jew - are not exempt .
making up around 8 % of the population of israel , the haredi community has real economic clout .
boycotts have been very effective .
menahem toker , an award-winning disc jockey , who was dismissed from a radio show under pressure from haredi activists , warns the policy could backfire .
" in jewish orthodox culture there 's no cinema , no theatre , no television .
the only thing we have is music " , says mr toker .
" we are the same , orthodox , people but if they do n't find an alternative they 'll lose the young people - they 'll go to non-kosher shows and they 'll have lost the next generation . "
it is a dire warning from a man who cares deeply about his religion and his music - but the hard-line rabbis are unapologetic .
in a world bursting with mobile phones , mp4 players and dvds they say it is their moral duty to protect young people against the evils of the modern world .
here is a selection of your comments : as orthodox jews , my husband and i listen to a wide variety of music .
i do not think either of our musical preferences in any way corrupts our morals .
rather , i believe the music we listen to gives voice to how we are feeling or how we wish to feel .
on a more important note , music can be used as a tool for reaching unaffiliated jews .
for instance , my mother-in-law uses the melodies from contemporary songs and adds jewish themes to teach her jewish kindergarten class - many of whom do not come from religious homes .
i believe that by restricting what music can be heard , the ultra orthodox are missing out on a fundamental tool which could be used to bridge the gap between religious and secular jews .
maya bahar , stamford , ct music is extremely powerful , and can affect people at a conscious -lrb- ie aware -rrb- , as well as sub-conscious level .
i 've changed my listening habits as i 've changed as a person .
in my wild and rebellious youth , it was all rap , and hip-hop .
now it 's calmer , gentler stuff , where it 's less about the rhythm , and more about the melody .
the rabbis clearly do know what they 're talking about , although i hope they allow their listeners to buy music of better quality than the first clip above .
r. e. brown , london as a muslim , i support the rabbi 's decision , finally they are thinking like conservative muslims ; after all muslims and jews are very much alike .
majority of modern music is immoral and degrading the faith .
zuber iraqi , louisville , ky i find this article extremely interesting .
i do n't think anyone can dispute the effect music has on the listener .
film makers have been using these music / sound techniques for many years .
music can put you into a scared , tense , happy and sad state .
as such it could probably be equal to any substance , where limits have to be put and overdoses of the wrong style could bring about negative results .
chulent fresser , kish mech , israel the jewish orthodox community have shown to me and others that the jewish faith often has a lot to share with the muslim faith .
the psychological effect of music and the message is contained is contaminating a lot of minds and causing a great deal of moral destruction .
muslims , jews , christians and everybody else should work together to reduce its influence in a world of deteriorating morality .
i applaud the strength of these orthodox jews to hold on to their faith and prevent the evils of music from corrupting yet more minds .
hassan , manchester , uk i think the rabbis do have a valid point to a certain extent .
but ban this music from our kids of today and they will turn to even more non-kosher sources for their entertainment .
besides , i am sure that 20-30 years ago the older generation were the saying the same of the then ' modern music ' .
steven kahn , london ; uk bonkers , they 're going bonkers .
it 's a good job they do n't listen to ' slayer ' ...
greg edelston , be-er sheva , israel i as an orthodox jew agree 100 % percent with the rabbi 's ruling although i am sure that somebody not jewish thinks it crazy , they ca n't understand our way we educate our kids , to be calm and respecting , and the fact is clear that this music interferes very strongly and has a very negative effect .
moshe davis , london another good example of the religious communities ' desire to alienate themselves from mainstream israeli society , and its culture which they seem to find an abomination .
no problem there , however they live here producing nothing towards the nation 's wealth , and yet criticise and pour scorn on all us secular jews .
gidon bennett , tel aviv israel as a jewish person , i find it remarkable that someone in the 21st century wants to repel any outside source or inspiration .
the haredi really do not resemble or reflect the majority of jewish people at all .
they are outdated and as much fanatics -lrb- although thankfully not violent -rrb- as any other sect .
in my opinion , they are missing out on loads and alienating their own !
william brown , uk everything must be taken in context .
the rabbi was speaking to the ' haredi ' people who live in a certain way within their communities .
to listen to ' modern ' music is changing a tradition of thousands of years , tradition being key to the jewish people .
in addition , it is clear that the style and beat of music affects people .
certain music cheers people up , others make people sad and others rouse people to become wild .
anyone who says that music has no affect on the listener is deluding themselves .
moshe kormornick , jerusalem music contains spiritual components and therefore it is important to give guidance to youth .
great rabbis have in the past given rulings about this subject , as jewish law covers all aspects of life .
rabbi schmahl , antwerp belgium censorship on lyrics is one thing , but when a society starts banning certain types of music or instruments , i am very , very concerned ...
valérie peters , podgorica , montenegro it 's good to know that fundamentalist rock-and-roll alarmism is n't just an american phenomenon .
justin anthony knapp , indianapolis , usa the rabbi is absolutely correct about the powerful influence music has on behaviour .
i am a bible-believing christian in a predominantly hindu / buddhist nation .
i used to love rock music and its beat and even played in bands .
music is certainly not amoral .
even if the lyrics are from the scriptures , if the music has , say , the rock beat , the chief human response is physical , not spiritual .
but when the spiritually-minded david played his harp before a mentally-spiritually depressed king saul , it had a most healthful influence upon not only his body but also his soul and spirit -lrb- 1 samuel 16:23 -rrb- .
pradesh shrestha , palung , nepal once upon a time , there was a group of people determined to control what the people could or could not read , watch and hear .
anything that did not fit with their view of ' decent ' , ' upstanding ' and ' respectable ' , was banned , leading to large-scale book-burnings .
that group of people later went on to ban and burn more than books .
" where they burn books , they will ultimately also burn people . " - heinrich heine jamie jones , linz , austria the rabbi 's attempted censorship of music because of beat or instrument choice rather than content is silly , and i think that he is exploiting his supposed religious authority to enforce his specific taste in music on the haredi public .
it will only cause division and ridicule , but it brings him celebrity , which is certainly " non-kosher " .
unlike the pop tunes and wedding songs which are a reasonable " kosher " replacement for decadent popular culture , the " modern " kol nidre is equally silly ; it completely lacks the power that the traditional cantorial version holds for millions of jews as the symbol of the beginning of the annual " judgement day " , yom kippur .
binyamin , eilat , israel it is obvious that a large segment of the music consumed by western youth is indecent and disrespectful -lrb- eg gangsta rap -rrb- .
even if the rabbi is going a step too far , we should not laugh at his notion but accept it as some food for thought .

sue presented a review of daily festival events in the x-change , a regular and very popular feature at the festival .
she also updated this page with all the gossip ...
friday 12 september : award-winning week 0900 : it 's always good to end on a high and last night we delivered .
among an incredibly strong line-up , the surprise star of the show was definitely our politically incorrect gynaecologist charles kingsland .
there 's a man with a second career ahead as a comedian as he managed to turn infertility into a scientific laugh-fest .
and when the opening act is a scientist and professional magician , that 's some compliment .
for me , the week has been a joy - both professionally and personally .
next year 's ba science festival in guildford , at the university of surrey , has a lot to live up to .
meanwhile , some unofficial awards after my time here in liverpool : best speaker : the gynaecologist .
best speaker on a unicycle : james soper best moustache : robert winston best dessert : the fried jam sandwich with condensed milk ice cream at a restaurant on hope street .
finally , i 've realised that i 've had more stimulating conversations with locals in four days than in the last four years in the county where i now live .
it has made me ask myself some uncomfortable questions .
such as why the hell am i now living in hertfordshire ?
liverpool , i shall miss you .
this is sue nelson , your scientific gossip girl , signing off .
thursday 11 september : sporty type 1715 : the q & a session on whether creationism should be a part of the science curriculum produced some memorable lines from the audience , including : " i 'm in favour of teaching creation science in schools because it would only takes 5 minutes ... " and " i 'm a neuroscientist and an agnostic hindu . "
the best rubbernecking occurred , however , when one brave youth announced : " i 'm a creationist and also a student of aerodynamics . "
brave man .
with an hour to go , we 've only just finalised our line-up - but it 's a good one : professional magician and psychologist richard wiseman on mind magic ; experts on fertility , old age and food poisoning ; and , last but not least , stand up science comic mark stevenson .
after last night 's juggling extravaganza expectations will be high .
1200 : it may be someone 's idea of a joke , but there are birds of prey opposite the press centre .
i 've become rather attached to the bald eagle , whose head swivels around in linda blair fashion whenever you walk past .
oh yes , that gossip .
ian pearson was here yesterday and , after an event organiser hailed him a taxi , a well known festival regular - let 's call him mr big - blatantly stole his cab .
on being informed by the organiser that the cab was for the science minister , mr big retorted " do you have a session in 45 minutes ? " and off he went , leaving the member of parliament on the pavement .
0815 : this feels unbelievably early considering how late i got to bed .
must be dehydration .
last night , i did n't get to eat until around 11pm after a session of the x-change followed by a technology and sport debate .
the latter included the bob skeleton world champion and sports engineering professor , kristan bromley .
he kept to soft drinks during dinner which is why kristan is a disciplined olympic standard athlete ... and i sit on a spreading backside typing on a keyboard for a living .
the x-change was riotous .
james soper brought the house down by explaining centre of mass and gravity while juggling three batons on a unicycle at the same time .
and staunch defenders of delia smith railed against peter styring 's analysis of her carbon footprint -lrb- because delia advocates the use of frozen mashed potato in one of her cookery books -rrb- .
" yes , but have you ever tried her fruit cake ? " one man shouted .
" it 's superb ! "
oh yes , i have some good gossip for you too ...
later .
i need some coffee .
wednesday 10 september : look closer 1600 : forgot my queasiness at all things medical and wandered into an exhibition on medical technology .
the first thing i came across was a television and , like the 70s child i am , was instantly drawn to a flickering image on the screen .
big mistake .
it was a beating heart with spurting dye revealing a network of tubes .
stunning in hindsight , and i got a wonderfully complete description from a researcher on blockages and stents , but thank goodness i only had soup for lunch .
meanwhile , tonight 's speakers include a neuroscientist , a scientific unicyclist and professor peter styring on delia smith 's carbon footprint .
peter is nothing if not versatile : a chemical engineer and also england 's mogul skiing coach .
after the x-change , he 's taking part in another festival event : a debate i 'm chairing on the role of engineering in sport .
there he 'll be offering a public sporting challenge to olympic athlete rebecca romero , who won a cycling gold in beijing and a silver medal for rowing in athens four years ago .
you heard it here first .
1300 : ten scientists and science communicators are judging the perspectives scientific posters .
bumped into one judge , science writer jon turney , who is currently working on the rough guide to the future .
he was in front of a poster by university of birmingham researcher lori snyder .
it displayed the white outline of a body , crime scene style , saying it showed the " mrsa genetic code of three million letters " .
it also asked if you could see from the code how it killed a 64-year-old woman .
nope , could n't see a thing .
' neither can scientists , ' it said , ' but we are working on it . '
simple but highly effective ... except jon pointed out that the poster did n't actually show the genetic code .
once invited to examine it closer , we made a discovery .
the entire background consisted of lines of letters g , a , t and c. three million in fact , although we took lori 's word for it .
the letters stand for guanine , adenine , thymine , cytosine - dna 's four nucleotides .
very clever .
the winners will be announced tonight .
tuesday 09 september : on my whistle 2300 : a good evening .
the x-change went well with professor pete vukusic bringing colour and iridescent butterflies to the proceedings , and clifford stott getting a rise out of the audience on why people become violent in groups .
the superbly engrossing session on slavery i attended this afternoon produced our final speaker .
dr ray costello is a liverpool-born historian whose ancestors came to liverpool from bermuda in the 1850s .
he provided a perfect and passionate counterpoint to suggestions yesterday that knowledge of our genetic history might lead to racism .
it was crucial , he argued , to know your heritage .
after our debrief with the team , i met a friend at a local restaurant to catch up on gossip .
who should enter but the moustache himself .
robert winston .
dining solo - or trying to .
poor man , he was interrupted about every five minutes by admirers or well wishers , including my predecessor on x-change , quentin cooper .
it reminded me of last year 's ba in york .
winston , i 'm sorry to disillusion you , does n't count journalists among his greatest fans .
he 's been known to be rude and incredibly impatient .
but after interviewing him in front of an audience , i witnessed firsthand why the public love him .
he was constantly approached by people - some with amazingly personal and painful revelations of infertility or miscarriages .
he dealt with every one of them with patience , grace and compassion .
quite an eye-opener .
1400 : the x-change team is everywhere - listening in on sessions about binge drinking , the new shape of science in the islamic world and womb wars .
robert winston , the man with the most recognisable moustache in britain , is naturally involved .
meanwhile i 'm heading to the merseyside maritime museum to hear what genetics tells us about the legacy of the slave trade .
but if there 's one session that sums up both a science -lrb- sociology -rrb- and the host city of this year 's festival it must be this one : " club upheaval and supporter sentiment - a case study of fan attitudes to everton football club 's proposed ground move " .
apparently some fans have embraced the move 's commercialism while others " approach the move in a more emotional way " .
i 'm guessing that 's a gem of an understatement .
1100 : exhausted .
the first x-change is always the hardest but the guests were strong - with quite a few having an alternative career ahead in stand-up comedy .
jim al-khalili set the tone and several researchers had the crowd laughing with them , not at them .
the researchers are part of the perspectives hustings .
last night , and tonight , five researchers each have two minutes to explain their poster topics on display at the festival .
i have a stopwatch and a whistle .
i really like the whistle .
speakers included steve fuller , who suggested that the current spate of " trace your ancestry " programmes promotes racism , giles yeo , who had boundless energy talking about obesity , and tim grant , who explained how forensic linguistics can identify villains in text crimes - which , in my opinion is anyone who does this : -rrb- an old school friend of mine , -lrb- now dr -rrb- tina read , was in the audience .
she has set up an educational genetics website , gene journey , and informed me of another ex-wirral grammar girl who is head of an inverness science department .
yet another , liz redmond , i know is a breast cancer surgeon in chester ; and it got me thinking about how amazing it was that one-third of our sixth form did science a levels .
it never felt unusual at the time .
our physics teacher , mrs schwarz , should be proud .
monday 08 september : old friends 1600 : our guests are booked and include physicist jim al-khalili and chemist lorrely wilson on fizz , foam and flubber .
after attending the session covering human skeletons , and hearing how scientists solved a 2,000-year-old murder mystery , i almost wish i 'd become a forensic archaeologist .
we even got to feel each other 's skulls , looking for ridges above the eyebrows as not everyone has them .
as i was fondling my neighbour 's head , i thought i 'd found one .
" sorry , " he said .
" it 's a cyst . " 1315 : oh dear .
my new best friend , david king , seems to have upset a few people .
a particle physicist was fuming in the press centre after reading on the bbc news website that king suggests more money should be spent on important issues such as climate change ... and less money on subjects such as ... err ... particle physics .
to add insult to injury , the physicist was preparing for his session on tv science when someone popped their head round the door , saw him and asked : " is this obesity ? "
meanwhile , in the hands-on centre , great fun is to be had making paper planes -lrb- an exercise in aerodynamic design -rrb- and learning about professor fluffy .
but the robots representing the launch of the first lego league were stalling .
" it 's ok , " said one of the scientists in front of a laptop .
" i 'll switch it off and switch it back on again . " 1030 : the x-change team is currently scouring the university of liverpool 's campus , attending lectures and searching for scientists with the gift of the gab .
i 'm down for " lifetime impact on the human skeleton : traces from the past " .
as long as no-one examines my liver .
our venue tonight is the guild of students bar so the promise of free drinks is often a great incentive .
all scientists have to do is agree to a short interview , take questions from the floor and enjoy themselves .
like last night 's audience at the " gr8 gm db8 2008 " .
do n't worry .
it took me a minute to understand that , too .
as expected , the audience asked thoughtful and intelligent questions right from the start - no warming up necessary .
it also included the former government chief scientific adviser and festival president , sir david king .
king once worked at the university of liverpool and was delighted at how the city has changed .
he 's quite a character and later , over a drink , recalled his introduction to liverpool humour .
he 'd spotted a mouse in a restaurant and had informed the waitress .
" that was just the floor show , " she deadpanned , and then flicked open the menu so he could choose his food .
sunday 07 september : liver bird returns 1700 : i love liverpool .
people talk .
on the train , it was a sixty-something local and fellow science fiction addict .
in a taxi , the driver discussed the city 's rejuvenation as the european capital of culture and how he was hoping to pop into the science festival -lrb- his daughter was a science undergraduate -rrb- .
both men asked : " is this your first time to liverpool ? "
i 'll come clean now .
i am the product of two scousers and originally from merseyside - albeit from the wirral - the so-called posh part .
the mild accent -lrb- it was the wirral after all ... -rrb- has long softened although i still say grass -lrb- as in ass -rrb- and not grass -lrb- as in arse -rrb- .
but it 's great to be on home turf .
as host of the festival 's x-change , liverpool makes for a good potential audience .
in london , if you try to accost people doing radio vox pops , everyone avoids you like the plague .
here , and i know from experience as i once worked for radio merseyside , you have to prise people away from the microphone .
everyone has something to say ; and that 's exactly how i like it .
today i met the team of x-change volunteers .
an impressive bunch .
one won the 2006 daily telegraph young science writer of the year award while another , dr angharad kerr , is from the department of neuroscience at university college london .
i feel terribly under-qualified all of a sudden ... time to chair a debate on gm - that 'll make me feel clever .
saturday 06 september - hot rocket 2100 : the festival began with a bang both in merseyside and - surprisingly for the organisers no doubt - hertfordshire .
adam hart davies officially opened the festival in liverpool with a science explosion event at the city 's world museum .
meanwhile , yours truly paid unofficial tribute to the opening with a space party in herts including three rocket launches .
ok , it was a model rocket - and instead of science-hungry scousers , substitute a bunch of eight-year-olds and our son matthew .
but they definitely saw some hot rocket action .
capable of reaching 500ft -lrb- 150m -rrb- , it soared into a grey sky , smoking the grass on our local field and no doubt terrifying parents who only found out about our escapades afterwards .
but it was great .
on sunday , for me at least , the real science action begins .
assuming my morning train to liverpool lime street is n't one of the hundreds that seem to be cancelled this weekend .
it 's a lethal combination - engineering works and bad weather .
if i was n't heading to a science festival i 'd cross my fingers .

sue presented a review of daily festival events in the x-change , a regular and very popular feature at the festival .
she also updated this page with all the gossip ...
friday 12 september : award-winning week 0900 : it 's always good to end on a high and last night we delivered .
among an incredibly strong line-up , the surprise star of the show was definitely our politically incorrect gynaecologist charles kingsland .
there 's a man with a second career ahead as a comedian as he managed to turn infertility into a scientific laugh-fest .
and when the opening act is a scientist and professional magician , that 's some compliment .
for me , the week has been a joy - both professionally and personally .
next year 's ba science festival in guildford , at the university of surrey , has a lot to live up to .
meanwhile , some unofficial awards after my time here in liverpool : best speaker : the gynaecologist .
best speaker on a unicycle : james soper best moustache : robert winston best dessert : the fried jam sandwich with condensed milk ice cream at a restaurant on hope street .
finally , i 've realised that i 've had more stimulating conversations with locals in four days than in the last four years in the county where i now live .
it has made me ask myself some uncomfortable questions .

wednesday 10 september : look closer 1600 : forgot my queasiness at all things medical and wandered into an exhibition on medical technology .
the first thing i came across was a television and , like the 70s child i am , was instantly drawn to a flickering image on the screen .
big mistake .
it was a beating heart with spurting dye revealing a network of tubes .
stunning in hindsight , and i got a wonderfully complete description from a researcher on blockages and stents , but thank goodness i only had soup for lunch .

friday 12 september : award-winning week 0900 : it 's always good to end on a high and last night we delivered .
among an incredibly strong line-up , the surprise star of the show was definitely our politically incorrect gynaecologist charles kingsland .
there 's a man with a second career ahead as a comedian as he managed to turn infertility into a scientific laugh-fest .
and when the opening act is a scientist and professional magician , that 's some compliment .
for me , the week has been a joy - both professionally and personally .
next year 's ba science festival in guildford , at the university of surrey , has a lot to live up to .
meanwhile , some unofficial awards after my time here in liverpool : best speaker : the gynaecologist .
best speaker on a unicycle : james soper best moustache : robert winston best dessert : the fried jam sandwich with condensed milk ice cream at a restaurant on hope street .
finally , i 've realised that i 've had more stimulating conversations with locals in four days than in the last four years in the county where i now live .
it has made me ask myself some uncomfortable questions .
such as why the hell am i now living in hertfordshire ?
liverpool , i shall miss you .
this is sue nelson , your scientific gossip girl , signing off .
thursday 11 september : sporty type 1715 : the q & a session on whether creationism should be a part of the science curriculum produced some memorable lines from the audience , including : " i 'm in favour of teaching creation science in schools because it would only takes 5 minutes ... " and " i 'm a neuroscientist and an agnostic hindu . "
the best rubbernecking occurred , however , when one brave youth announced : " i 'm a creationist and also a student of aerodynamics . "
brave man .
with an hour to go , we 've only just finalised our line-up - but it 's a good one : professional magician and psychologist richard wiseman on mind magic ; experts on fertility , old age and food poisoning ; and , last but not least , stand up science comic mark stevenson .
after last night 's juggling extravaganza expectations will be high .
1200 : it may be someone 's idea of a joke , but there are birds of prey opposite the press centre .
i 've become rather attached to the bald eagle , whose head swivels around in linda blair fashion whenever you walk past .
oh yes , that gossip .
ian pearson was here yesterday and , after an event organiser hailed him a taxi , a well known festival regular - let 's call him mr big - blatantly stole his cab .
on being informed by the organiser that the cab was for the science minister , mr big retorted " do you have a session in 45 minutes ? " and off he went , leaving the member of parliament on the pavement .
0815 : this feels unbelievably early considering how late i got to bed .
must be dehydration .
last night , i did n't get to eat until around 11pm after a session of the x-change followed by a technology and sport debate .
the latter included the bob skeleton world champion and sports engineering professor , kristan bromley .
he kept to soft drinks during dinner which is why kristan is a disciplined olympic standard athlete ... and i sit on a spreading backside typing on a keyboard for a living .
the x-change was riotous .
james soper brought the house down by explaining centre of mass and gravity while juggling three batons on a unicycle at the same time .
and staunch defenders of delia smith railed against peter styring 's analysis of her carbon footprint -lrb- because delia advocates the use of frozen mashed potato in one of her cookery books -rrb- .
" yes , but have you ever tried her fruit cake ? " one man shouted .
" it 's superb ! "
oh yes , i have some good gossip for you too ...
later .
i need some coffee .
wednesday 10 september : look closer 1600 : forgot my queasiness at all things medical and wandered into an exhibition on medical technology .
the first thing i came across was a television and , like the 70s child i am , was instantly drawn to a flickering image on the screen .
big mistake .
it was a beating heart with spurting dye revealing a network of tubes .
stunning in hindsight , and i got a wonderfully complete description from a researcher on blockages and stents , but thank goodness i only had soup for lunch .
meanwhile , tonight 's speakers include a neuroscientist , a scientific unicyclist and professor peter styring on delia smith 's carbon footprint .
peter is nothing if not versatile : a chemical engineer and also england 's mogul skiing coach .
after the x-change , he 's taking part in another festival event : a debate i 'm chairing on the role of engineering in sport .
there he 'll be offering a public sporting challenge to olympic athlete rebecca romero , who won a cycling gold in beijing and a silver medal for rowing in athens four years ago .
you heard it here first .
1300 : ten scientists and science communicators are judging the perspectives scientific posters .
bumped into one judge , science writer jon turney , who is currently working on the rough guide to the future .
he was in front of a poster by university of birmingham researcher lori snyder .
it displayed the white outline of a body , crime scene style , saying it showed the " mrsa genetic code of three million letters " .
it also asked if you could see from the code how it killed a 64-year-old woman .
nope , could n't see a thing .
' neither can scientists , ' it said , ' but we are working on it . '
simple but highly effective ... except jon pointed out that the poster did n't actually show the genetic code .
once invited to examine it closer , we made a discovery .
the entire background consisted of lines of letters g , a , t and c. three million in fact , although we took lori 's word for it .
the letters stand for guanine , adenine , thymine , cytosine - dna 's four nucleotides .
very clever .
the winners will be announced tonight .
tuesday 09 september : on my whistle 2300 : a good evening .
the x-change went well with professor pete vukusic bringing colour and iridescent butterflies to the proceedings , and clifford stott getting a rise out of the audience on why people become violent in groups .
the superbly engrossing session on slavery i attended this afternoon produced our final speaker .
dr ray costello is a liverpool-born historian whose ancestors came to liverpool from bermuda in the 1850s .
he provided a perfect and passionate counterpoint to suggestions yesterday that knowledge of our genetic history might lead to racism .
it was crucial , he argued , to know your heritage .
after our debrief with the team , i met a friend at a local restaurant to catch up on gossip .
who should enter but the moustache himself .
robert winston .
dining solo - or trying to .
poor man , he was interrupted about every five minutes by admirers or well wishers , including my predecessor on x-change , quentin cooper .
it reminded me of last year 's ba in york .
winston , i 'm sorry to disillusion you , does n't count journalists among his greatest fans .
he 's been known to be rude and incredibly impatient .
but after interviewing him in front of an audience , i witnessed firsthand why the public love him .
he was constantly approached by people - some with amazingly personal and painful revelations of infertility or miscarriages .
he dealt with every one of them with patience , grace and compassion .
quite an eye-opener .
1400 : the x-change team is everywhere - listening in on sessions about binge drinking , the new shape of science in the islamic world and womb wars .
robert winston , the man with the most recognisable moustache in britain , is naturally involved .
meanwhile i 'm heading to the merseyside maritime museum to hear what genetics tells us about the legacy of the slave trade .
but if there 's one session that sums up both a science -lrb- sociology -rrb- and the host city of this year 's festival it must be this one : " club upheaval and supporter sentiment - a case study of fan attitudes to everton football club 's proposed ground move " .
apparently some fans have embraced the move 's commercialism while others " approach the move in a more emotional way " .
i 'm guessing that 's a gem of an understatement .
1100 : exhausted .
the first x-change is always the hardest but the guests were strong - with quite a few having an alternative career ahead in stand-up comedy .
jim al-khalili set the tone and several researchers had the crowd laughing with them , not at them .
the researchers are part of the perspectives hustings .
last night , and tonight , five researchers each have two minutes to explain their poster topics on display at the festival .
i have a stopwatch and a whistle .
i really like the whistle .
speakers included steve fuller , who suggested that the current spate of " trace your ancestry " programmes promotes racism , giles yeo , who had boundless energy talking about obesity , and tim grant , who explained how forensic linguistics can identify villains in text crimes - which , in my opinion is anyone who does this : -rrb- an old school friend of mine , -lrb- now dr -rrb- tina read , was in the audience .
she has set up an educational genetics website , gene journey , and informed me of another ex-wirral grammar girl who is head of an inverness science department .
yet another , liz redmond , i know is a breast cancer surgeon in chester ; and it got me thinking about how amazing it was that one-third of our sixth form did science a levels .
it never felt unusual at the time .
our physics teacher , mrs schwarz , should be proud .
monday 08 september : old friends 1600 : our guests are booked and include physicist jim al-khalili and chemist lorrely wilson on fizz , foam and flubber .
after attending the session covering human skeletons , and hearing how scientists solved a 2,000-year-old murder mystery , i almost wish i 'd become a forensic archaeologist .
we even got to feel each other 's skulls , looking for ridges above the eyebrows as not everyone has them .
as i was fondling my neighbour 's head , i thought i 'd found one .
" sorry , " he said .
" it 's a cyst . " 1315 : oh dear .
my new best friend , david king , seems to have upset a few people .
a particle physicist was fuming in the press centre after reading on the bbc news website that king suggests more money should be spent on important issues such as climate change ... and less money on subjects such as ... err ... particle physics .
to add insult to injury , the physicist was preparing for his session on tv science when someone popped their head round the door , saw him and asked : " is this obesity ? "
meanwhile , in the hands-on centre , great fun is to be had making paper planes -lrb- an exercise in aerodynamic design -rrb- and learning about professor fluffy .
but the robots representing the launch of the first lego league were stalling .
" it 's ok , " said one of the scientists in front of a laptop .
" i 'll switch it off and switch it back on again . " 1030 : the x-change team is currently scouring the university of liverpool 's campus , attending lectures and searching for scientists with the gift of the gab .
i 'm down for " lifetime impact on the human skeleton : traces from the past " .
as long as no-one examines my liver .
our venue tonight is the guild of students bar so the promise of free drinks is often a great incentive .
all scientists have to do is agree to a short interview , take questions from the floor and enjoy themselves .
like last night 's audience at the " gr8 gm db8 2008 " .
do n't worry .
it took me a minute to understand that , too .
as expected , the audience asked thoughtful and intelligent questions right from the start - no warming up necessary .
it also included the former government chief scientific adviser and festival president , sir david king .
king once worked at the university of liverpool and was delighted at how the city has changed .
he 's quite a character and later , over a drink , recalled his introduction to liverpool humour .
he 'd spotted a mouse in a restaurant and had informed the waitress .
" that was just the floor show , " she deadpanned , and then flicked open the menu so he could choose his food .
sunday 07 september : liver bird returns 1700 : i love liverpool .
people talk .
on the train , it was a sixty-something local and fellow science fiction addict .
in a taxi , the driver discussed the city 's rejuvenation as the european capital of culture and how he was hoping to pop into the science festival -lrb- his daughter was a science undergraduate -rrb- .
both men asked : " is this your first time to liverpool ? "
i 'll come clean now .
i am the product of two scousers and originally from merseyside - albeit from the wirral - the so-called posh part .
the mild accent -lrb- it was the wirral after all ... -rrb- has long softened although i still say grass -lrb- as in ass -rrb- and not grass -lrb- as in arse -rrb- .
but it 's great to be on home turf .
as host of the festival 's x-change , liverpool makes for a good potential audience .
in london , if you try to accost people doing radio vox pops , everyone avoids you like the plague .
here , and i know from experience as i once worked for radio merseyside , you have to prise people away from the microphone .
everyone has something to say ; and that 's exactly how i like it .
today i met the team of x-change volunteers .
an impressive bunch .
one won the 2006 daily telegraph young science writer of the year award while another , dr angharad kerr , is from the department of neuroscience at university college london .
i feel terribly under-qualified all of a sudden ... time to chair a debate on gm - that 'll make me feel clever .
saturday 06 september - hot rocket 2100 : the festival began with a bang both in merseyside and - surprisingly for the organisers no doubt - hertfordshire .
adam hart davies officially opened the festival in liverpool with a science explosion event at the city 's world museum .
meanwhile , yours truly paid unofficial tribute to the opening with a space party in herts including three rocket launches .
ok , it was a model rocket - and instead of science-hungry scousers , substitute a bunch of eight-year-olds and our son matthew .
but they definitely saw some hot rocket action .
capable of reaching 500ft -lrb- 150m -rrb- , it soared into a grey sky , smoking the grass on our local field and no doubt terrifying parents who only found out about our escapades afterwards .
but it was great .
on sunday , for me at least , the real science action begins .
assuming my morning train to liverpool lime street is n't one of the hundreds that seem to be cancelled this weekend .
it 's a lethal combination - engineering works and bad weather .
if i was n't heading to a science festival i 'd cross my fingers .

" that was just the floor show , " she deadpanned , and then flicked open the menu so he could choose his food .
sunday 07 september : liver bird returns 1700 : i love liverpool .
people talk .
on the train , it was a sixty-something local and fellow science fiction addict .
in a taxi , the driver discussed the city 's rejuvenation as the european capital of culture and how he was hoping to pop into the science festival -lrb- his daughter was a science undergraduate -rrb- .
both men asked : " is this your first time to liverpool ? "
i 'll come clean now .
i am the product of two scousers and originally from merseyside - albeit from the wirral - the so-called posh part .
the mild accent -lrb- it was the wirral after all ... -rrb- has long softened although i still say grass -lrb- as in ass -rrb- and not grass -lrb- as in arse -rrb- .
but it 's great to be on home turf .
as host of the festival 's x-change , liverpool makes for a good potential audience .
in london , if you try to accost people doing radio vox pops , everyone avoids you like the plague .
here , and i know from experience as i once worked for radio merseyside , you have to prise people away from the microphone .
everyone has something to say ; and that 's exactly how i like it .
today i met the team of x-change volunteers .
an impressive bunch .
one won the 2006 daily telegraph young science writer of the year award while another , dr angharad kerr , is from the department of neuroscience at university college london .
i feel terribly under-qualified all of a sudden ... time to chair a debate on gm - that 'll make me feel clever .
saturday 06 september - hot rocket 2100 : the festival began with a bang both in merseyside and - surprisingly for the organisers no doubt - hertfordshire .
adam hart davies officially opened the festival in liverpool with a science explosion event at the city 's world museum .
meanwhile , yours truly paid unofficial tribute to the opening with a space party in herts including three rocket launches .
ok , it was a model rocket - and instead of science-hungry scousers , substitute a bunch of eight-year-olds and our son matthew .
but they definitely saw some hot rocket action .
capable of reaching 500ft -lrb- 150m -rrb- , it soared into a grey sky , smoking the grass on our local field and no doubt terrifying parents who only found out about our escapades afterwards .
but it was great .
on sunday , for me at least , the real science action begins .
assuming my morning train to liverpool lime street is n't one of the hundreds that seem to be cancelled this weekend .
it 's a lethal combination - engineering works and bad weather .
if i was n't heading to a science festival i 'd cross my fingers .

alex stovold , from norwich , claims that national express east anglia had failed commuters on lines between norfolk , suffolk and essex and the capital .
the petition , set up on the downing street website , asks the prime minister to set up an inquiry .
national express ea declined to comment but said they were aware of a petition .
mr stovold said he was fed up with delays and cancellations on the mainline and an online petition was the only way to get people in power to listen .
" east anglia has been earmarked by the government for significant development and population growth in the run up to the 2012 olympic games , " mr stovold said .
" but since the beginning of this year there has been clear evidence of failures of the train service . "
he is calling for action and investment now because " passengers in east anglia deserve better " , he said .

sue presented a review of daily festival events in the x-change , a regular and very popular feature at the festival .
she also updated this page with all the gossip ...
friday 12 september : award-winning week 0900 : it 's always good to end on a high and last night we delivered .
among an incredibly strong line-up , the surprise star of the show was definitely our politically incorrect gynaecologist charles kingsland .
there 's a man with a second career ahead as a comedian as he managed to turn infertility into a scientific laugh-fest .
and when the opening act is a scientist and professional magician , that 's some compliment .
for me , the week has been a joy - both professionally and personally .
next year 's ba science festival in guildford , at the university of surrey , has a lot to live up to .
meanwhile , some unofficial awards after my time here in liverpool : best speaker : the gynaecologist .
best speaker on a unicycle : james soper best moustache : robert winston best dessert : the fried jam sandwich with condensed milk ice cream at a restaurant on hope street .
finally , i 've realised that i 've had more stimulating conversations with locals in four days than in the last four years in the county where i now live .
it has made me ask myself some uncomfortable questions .
such as why the hell am i now living in hertfordshire ?
liverpool , i shall miss you .
this is sue nelson , your scientific gossip girl , signing off .
thursday 11 september : sporty type 1715 : the q & a session on whether creationism should be a part of the science curriculum produced some memorable lines from the audience , including : " i 'm in favour of teaching creation science in schools because it would only takes 5 minutes ... " and " i 'm a neuroscientist and an agnostic hindu . "
the best rubbernecking occurred , however , when one brave youth announced : " i 'm a creationist and also a student of aerodynamics . "
brave man .
with an hour to go , we 've only just finalised our line-up - but it 's a good one : professional magician and psychologist richard wiseman on mind magic ; experts on fertility , old age and food poisoning ; and , last but not least , stand up science comic mark stevenson .
after last night 's juggling extravaganza expectations will be high .
1200 : it may be someone 's idea of a joke , but there are birds of prey opposite the press centre .
i 've become rather attached to the bald eagle , whose head swivels around in linda blair fashion whenever you walk past .
oh yes , that gossip .
ian pearson was here yesterday and , after an event organiser hailed him a taxi , a well known festival regular - let 's call him mr big - blatantly stole his cab .
on being informed by the organiser that the cab was for the science minister , mr big retorted " do you have a session in 45 minutes ? " and off he went , leaving the member of parliament on the pavement .
0815 : this feels unbelievably early considering how late i got to bed .
must be dehydration .
last night , i did n't get to eat until around 11pm after a session of the x-change followed by a technology and sport debate .
the latter included the bob skeleton world champion and sports engineering professor , kristan bromley .
he kept to soft drinks during dinner which is why kristan is a disciplined olympic standard athlete ... and i sit on a spreading backside typing on a keyboard for a living .
the x-change was riotous .
james soper brought the house down by explaining centre of mass and gravity while juggling three batons on a unicycle at the same time .
and staunch defenders of delia smith railed against peter styring 's analysis of her carbon footprint -lrb- because delia advocates the use of frozen mashed potato in one of her cookery books -rrb- .
" yes , but have you ever tried her fruit cake ? " one man shouted .
" it 's superb ! "
oh yes , i have some good gossip for you too ...
later .
i need some coffee .
wednesday 10 september : look closer 1600 : forgot my queasiness at all things medical and wandered into an exhibition on medical technology .
the first thing i came across was a television and , like the 70s child i am , was instantly drawn to a flickering image on the screen .
big mistake .
it was a beating heart with spurting dye revealing a network of tubes .
stunning in hindsight , and i got a wonderfully complete description from a researcher on blockages and stents , but thank goodness i only had soup for lunch .
meanwhile , tonight 's speakers include a neuroscientist , a scientific unicyclist and professor peter styring on delia smith 's carbon footprint .
peter is nothing if not versatile : a chemical engineer and also england 's mogul skiing coach .
after the x-change , he 's taking part in another festival event : a debate i 'm chairing on the role of engineering in sport .
there he 'll be offering a public sporting challenge to olympic athlete rebecca romero , who won a cycling gold in beijing and a silver medal for rowing in athens four years ago .
you heard it here first .
1300 : ten scientists and science communicators are judging the perspectives scientific posters .
bumped into one judge , science writer jon turney , who is currently working on the rough guide to the future .
he was in front of a poster by university of birmingham researcher lori snyder .
it displayed the white outline of a body , crime scene style , saying it showed the " mrsa genetic code of three million letters " .
it also asked if you could see from the code how it killed a 64-year-old woman .
nope , could n't see a thing .
' neither can scientists , ' it said , ' but we are working on it . '
simple but highly effective ... except jon pointed out that the poster did n't actually show the genetic code .
once invited to examine it closer , we made a discovery .
the entire background consisted of lines of letters g , a , t and c. three million in fact , although we took lori 's word for it .
the letters stand for guanine , adenine , thymine , cytosine - dna 's four nucleotides .
very clever .
the winners will be announced tonight .
tuesday 09 september : on my whistle 2300 : a good evening .
the x-change went well with professor pete vukusic bringing colour and iridescent butterflies to the proceedings , and clifford stott getting a rise out of the audience on why people become violent in groups .
the superbly engrossing session on slavery i attended this afternoon produced our final speaker .
dr ray costello is a liverpool-born historian whose ancestors came to liverpool from bermuda in the 1850s .
he provided a perfect and passionate counterpoint to suggestions yesterday that knowledge of our genetic history might lead to racism .
it was crucial , he argued , to know your heritage .
after our debrief with the team , i met a friend at a local restaurant to catch up on gossip .
who should enter but the moustache himself .
robert winston .
dining solo - or trying to .
poor man , he was interrupted about every five minutes by admirers or well wishers , including my predecessor on x-change , quentin cooper .
it reminded me of last year 's ba in york .
winston , i 'm sorry to disillusion you , does n't count journalists among his greatest fans .
he 's been known to be rude and incredibly impatient .
but after interviewing him in front of an audience , i witnessed firsthand why the public love him .
he was constantly approached by people - some with amazingly personal and painful revelations of infertility or miscarriages .
he dealt with every one of them with patience , grace and compassion .
quite an eye-opener .
1400 : the x-change team is everywhere - listening in on sessions about binge drinking , the new shape of science in the islamic world and womb wars .
robert winston , the man with the most recognisable moustache in britain , is naturally involved .
meanwhile i 'm heading to the merseyside maritime museum to hear what genetics tells us about the legacy of the slave trade .
but if there 's one session that sums up both a science -lrb- sociology -rrb- and the host city of this year 's festival it must be this one : " club upheaval and supporter sentiment - a case study of fan attitudes to everton football club 's proposed ground move " .
apparently some fans have embraced the move 's commercialism while others " approach the move in a more emotional way " .
i 'm guessing that 's a gem of an understatement .
1100 : exhausted .
the first x-change is always the hardest but the guests were strong - with quite a few having an alternative career ahead in stand-up comedy .
jim al-khalili set the tone and several researchers had the crowd laughing with them , not at them .
the researchers are part of the perspectives hustings .
last night , and tonight , five researchers each have two minutes to explain their poster topics on display at the festival .
i have a stopwatch and a whistle .
i really like the whistle .
speakers included steve fuller , who suggested that the current spate of " trace your ancestry " programmes promotes racism , giles yeo , who had boundless energy talking about obesity , and tim grant , who explained how forensic linguistics can identify villains in text crimes - which , in my opinion is anyone who does this : -rrb- an old school friend of mine , -lrb- now dr -rrb- tina read , was in the audience .
she has set up an educational genetics website , gene journey , and informed me of another ex-wirral grammar girl who is head of an inverness science department .
yet another , liz redmond , i know is a breast cancer surgeon in chester ; and it got me thinking about how amazing it was that one-third of our sixth form did science a levels .
it never felt unusual at the time .
our physics teacher , mrs schwarz , should be proud .
monday 08 september : old friends 1600 : our guests are booked and include physicist jim al-khalili and chemist lorrely wilson on fizz , foam and flubber .
after attending the session covering human skeletons , and hearing how scientists solved a 2,000-year-old murder mystery , i almost wish i 'd become a forensic archaeologist .
we even got to feel each other 's skulls , looking for ridges above the eyebrows as not everyone has them .
as i was fondling my neighbour 's head , i thought i 'd found one .
" sorry , " he said .
" it 's a cyst . " 1315 : oh dear .
my new best friend , david king , seems to have upset a few people .
a particle physicist was fuming in the press centre after reading on the bbc news website that king suggests more money should be spent on important issues such as climate change ... and less money on subjects such as ... err ... particle physics .
to add insult to injury , the physicist was preparing for his session on tv science when someone popped their head round the door , saw him and asked : " is this obesity ? "
meanwhile , in the hands-on centre , great fun is to be had making paper planes -lrb- an exercise in aerodynamic design -rrb- and learning about professor fluffy .
but the robots representing the launch of the first lego league were stalling .
" it 's ok , " said one of the scientists in front of a laptop .
" i 'll switch it off and switch it back on again . " 1030 : the x-change team is currently scouring the university of liverpool 's campus , attending lectures and searching for scientists with the gift of the gab .
i 'm down for " lifetime impact on the human skeleton : traces from the past " .
as long as no-one examines my liver .
our venue tonight is the guild of students bar so the promise of free drinks is often a great incentive .
all scientists have to do is agree to a short interview , take questions from the floor and enjoy themselves .
like last night 's audience at the " gr8 gm db8 2008 " .
do n't worry .
it took me a minute to understand that , too .
as expected , the audience asked thoughtful and intelligent questions right from the start - no warming up necessary .
it also included the former government chief scientific adviser and festival president , sir david king .
king once worked at the university of liverpool and was delighted at how the city has changed .
he 's quite a character and later , over a drink , recalled his introduction to liverpool humour .
he 'd spotted a mouse in a restaurant and had informed the waitress .
" that was just the floor show , " she deadpanned , and then flicked open the menu so he could choose his food .
sunday 07 september : liver bird returns 1700 : i love liverpool .
people talk .
on the train , it was a sixty-something local and fellow science fiction addict .
in a taxi , the driver discussed the city 's rejuvenation as the european capital of culture and how he was hoping to pop into the science festival -lrb- his daughter was a science undergraduate -rrb- .

but it 's great to be on home turf .
as host of the festival 's x-change , liverpool makes for a good potential audience .
in london , if you try to accost people doing radio vox pops , everyone avoids you like the plague .
here , and i know from experience as i once worked for radio merseyside , you have to prise people away from the microphone .
everyone has something to say ; and that 's exactly how i like it .
today i met the team of x-change volunteers .
an impressive bunch .
one won the 2006 daily telegraph young science writer of the year award while another , dr angharad kerr , is from the department of neuroscience at university college london .
i feel terribly under-qualified all of a sudden ... time to chair a debate on gm - that 'll make me feel clever .
saturday 06 september - hot rocket 2100 : the festival began with a bang both in merseyside and - surprisingly for the organisers no doubt - hertfordshire .

but it was great .
on sunday , for me at least , the real science action begins .
assuming my morning train to liverpool lime street is n't one of the hundreds that seem to be cancelled this weekend .
it 's a lethal combination - engineering works and bad weather .
if i was n't heading to a science festival i 'd cross my fingers .
