a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .

" we got the application today .
i found it slightly nasty , " he added . officials and media following the wagner family said they had never heard of richard bauer .
schmid said that if he was genuine , he did n't go about the application process in the right way . keeping it in the family the applicant said his policy was to hand out tickets for free and raise money with a tv series about the wagner family 's turmoil-filled history .
bauer said he would change his surname to " wagner " if given the job . on monday in an email distributed to board members bauer threatened to exercise a wagner descendant right of veto over the appointment of the wagner sisters and to enforce this by court order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the daughter of wieland wagner the decision to award the opera post jointly to katharina and eva and thereby passing over their cousin and rival nike wagner and her business partner gerard mortier came after the board began deliberating over the successor to wolfgang wagner , who stepped down as director at the end of august after 57 years . the bayreuth festival is always run by a wagner descendant . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc could freeze ongoing talks on the renewal of a wide-ranging eu-russia cooperation agreement ; it could introduce trade sanctions ; and it could refuse to give russian citizens visa-free travel to europe . but even if leaders agree on any retaliatory measures on monday , something that is by no means guaranteed , experts wonder whether these are good enough cards to trump moscow . russia is europe 's biggest energy supplier , its biggest neighbor , a huge and growing market and a key diplomatic player in areas such as afghanistan , the middle east and iran . russian leaders have already shown that they have no qualms about offending european sensibilities , whether by cutting off energy supplies to ukraine -lrb- 2005-06 -rrb- and lithuania -lrb- 2006 -rrb- or vetoing un support for the independence of kosovo -lrb- 2007 -rrb- . in addition , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev have already preempted some of the west 's threats by declaring the g8 " pointless " and questioning whether joining the wto would be in russia 's best interest . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the crowning of barak obama is over , and now is the time for republican john mccain to step into the ring .
for the senior senator from arizona , his party 's convention is all about one thing : distinguishing himself from president george w. bush . mccain ca n't afford to give the impression that his presidency would be identical to bush 's , with a different face .
if he does , he will never be able to pull the middle moderates and liberals to his side .
at the same time , however , the vietnam vet ca n't alienate those bush devotees , which are sure to still exist within the party , causing them to pull their support . hurricane gustav has come to help mccain with this balancing act .
because of the looming crisis , bush has been forced to cancel his trip to the convention , which , incidentally , had only been scheduled a short while ago .
this is good for mccain , because he is striving to be seen as an honest broker and he and bush honestly never liked each other anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz more important for mccain than the support of the white house is the selection of a running mate .
whether or not 44-year-old sarah palin was a good choice remains to be seen .

for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the crowning of barak obama is over , and now is the time for republican john mccain to step into the ring .
for the senior senator from arizona , his party 's convention is all about one thing : distinguishing himself from president george w. bush . mccain ca n't afford to give the impression that his presidency would be identical to bush 's , with a different face .
if he does , he will never be able to pull the middle moderates and liberals to his side .
at the same time , however , the vietnam vet ca n't alienate those bush devotees , which are sure to still exist within the party , causing them to pull their support . hurricane gustav has come to help mccain with this balancing act .
because of the looming crisis , bush has been forced to cancel his trip to the convention , which , incidentally , had only been scheduled a short while ago .
this is good for mccain , because he is striving to be seen as an honest broker and he and bush honestly never liked each other anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz more important for mccain than the support of the white house is the selection of a running mate .
whether or not 44-year-old sarah palin was a good choice remains to be seen .
palin can certainly bring women and , as a conservative moralist , the religious right to the ballot box for mccain . at the same time , however , the governor from alaska is so far removed from world politics that you have to ask yourself : what would happen if she actually had to take over for a geriatric mccain ?
as a former journalist , palin does bring some media experience with her , but the economic experience is lacking . and herein lies a second problem for the mccain campaign .
unlike the democrats , the republicans believe that it ’ s best to let the economy take care of itself .
low taxes and the market ’ s self-healing ability should regulate it , even if the american economy has long been incurring a structural imbalance on a global scale .
who other than the white , male , middleclass homeowner is going to vote for mccain ? but it is just this clientele , who has been hardest hit by the economic downturn .
mccain is going to have to come up with a convincing answer to this at the convention .
resolute stances on foreign policy issues , like the recent crisis between russian and georgia , are one thing .
economic recipes to fight a recession are something else completely . as former president bill clinton once fittingly said during his campaign against bush sr. : it ’ s the economy , stupid .
the economy makes the difference .
this could prove to be true once again this year come nov .

the competition was fierce , but after a long debate , board members have finally selected his replacement . half-sisters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier have been picked to run the bayreuth festival of wagner opera in germany , sources said monday as a board meeting ended .
they are to succeed their father , wolfgang wagner who officially retired sunday . competing against them was their estranged cousin , nike wagner , who was allied with opera chief and future new york city opera director gerhard mortier .
nike wagner is the daughter of wolfgang wagner ’ s brother , wieland , who died in 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner kunstfest weimar nike wagner said in a statement that the procedure was very outlandish .
she stated that she was sad about the outcome , but hopes that her cousins take the suggestions offered by her and gerard mortier . “ i wish them lots of luck , ” she added . wolf siegfried wagner , nike ’ s brother , refused to comment on behalf of the wieland wagner family . the future of bayreuth the two great-granddaughters of richard wagner will now enter into contract negotiations .
unlike their father , they will not be offered lifelong contracts .
additionally the controlling share of the bayreuth festival gmbh , which was owned by wolfgang wagner , will be divided equally among the members of the board of directors .

eu leaders seem to agree . the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- issued its call against sanctions as european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders prepared to hold an extraordinary summit in brussels to discuss the bloc 's response to the crisis in the southern caucasus . proposals to put russia under pressure through sanctions or to halt world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- accession talks or partnership with the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- lead in the wrong direction , bdi president juergen thumann said . " we would all lose if this were to happen , " thumann added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen thumann , bdi president , says sanctions lead in the wrong direction germany and russia needed good relations , and the mutual economic involvement should work to dampen the crisis , thumann said . " we need more dialogue rather than more confrontation , " the german business chief said , adding that business was prepared to make its contribution . business worth billions germany imported goods to the value of 28.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- from russia last year , much of it in oil and gas , while russia imported goods valued at 28.2 billion euros , largely machinery and vehicles . eu members that were previously in the soviet sphere of influence have come out for a strong response to russia 's military incursion into georgia last month , while some other countries in the 27-member bloc have urged moderation . solana : aid , not sanctions ahead of monday 's summit eu foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said that the bloc would not approve sanctions against russia , but will instead discuss sending economic aid and a civilian mission to georgia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana thinks the eu has an obligation to help georgia " i think sanctions are not on the agenda today , " solana said after holding talks in brussels with visiting georgian prime minister vladimir gurgenidze . the eu is split on the issue of sanctions , with poland and the baltic states on one side insisting that the eu should punish russia , and france , germany and italy saying instead that dialogue with moscow is the best way forward . desperate for unity speaking in vienna , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said the eu should agree on a strong position on russia 's actions in georgia . " should the european union not be able to find a clear , strong , common position , we can write off the european union as a political project for some time to come , " schwarzenberg said , but added that he also did n't believe sanctions were the way to go . in the meantime , the eu has an " obligation " to help georgia , which has suffered " tremendous damage on the ground " , said solana , who plans to visit moscow and tbilisi some time soon . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .

now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .

now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .
from there the artists move on to a final show in lille . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : palin 's lack of economic savvy could hurt mccain john mccain is the presumptive nominee for the republican party .
for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz .

impressive choruses and solo vocal sections drastically depict not only the suffering of jews in the concentration camps but also the fate of soldiers abused as cannon fodder and sent back to the homeland in tin coffins .
hk gruber , austrian composer and the conductor of this performance , combined eisler 's " german symphony " with music by kurt weill and one of his own orchestral works , entitled " charivari . "
the name translates roughly as " caterwauling . "
in the deconstruction of a polka melody , the work refers to the co-responsibility of austrians for war and terror . dw staff -lrb- gs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .
from there the artists move on to a final show in lille . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .
" we do n't need these talks or this new agreement any more than the eu does , " russia 's envoy to the eu vladimir chizhov told reporters . eu re-examines russian relations the french leader told the press that a visit to moscow sept .
8 by himself , barroso and eu foreign policy chief javier solana would be " crucial " for relations between the 27-nation bloc and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian separatists wave a kalashnikov and the south ossetian flag , in in tskhinvali sarkozy said russia 's " disproportionate use of force " and its recognition of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia meant the eu had no choice but to re-examine its relationship with russia . " it is clear that in the light of recent events , we can not continue as if nothing has happened , " barroso said . but the leaders decided against imposing any sanctions .
several member states , most notably poland and the baltics , had been pressing for punitive measures against russia , whereas great britain had argued strongly to suspend the partnership talks . " let 's not launch a cold war .
there 's no need to flex our muscles .
demonstrations of force , verbal aggression , sanctions , counter-sanctions ; these will not serve anyone , " sarkozy said .
eu condemns recognition of rebel georgian regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov warned the west against supporting georgia 's leadership at the start of the summit , eu leaders issued a strong condemnation of russia for its recognition of independence for the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " we appeal to other countries not to recognize their proclamation of independence , " they said .
so far , russia is the only country to have recognized the two regions as independent nations .
and only belarus and venezuela have indicated they might do the same .
however russia 's isolation has not stopped president dmitry medvedev from warning the eu that moscow 's decision to recognize the georgian enclaves was " irrevocable . "
revived fears of a new cold war international condemnation has also not stopped moscow from claiming the military intervention as an example of its return to the world stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian honor guards bury soldiers killed during the georgian-russian war " russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said moscow and added that the conflict in georgia had set a new standard for defending moscow 's national interests .
the conflict between georgia and russia has revived fears of a new cold war and has also highlighted deep divisions within the 27-member bloc .
but sarkozy stressed on monday that the eu had shown that it was united .
the president also insisted that the eu should continue to hold dialogue with , rather than isolate , moscow . " we condemn the disproportionate reaction of the russians and we are aware of our responsibilities in keeping dialogue with our russian partner on the rails , " sarkozy said . " we are also aware of the expectations on the georgian side and we will not disappoint them , " he added . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .
he also said the eu was planning to send hundreds of observers to georgia to verify if moscow is implementing the ceasefire agreement . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia , in particular the crimea , ukraine and moldova , " he added . even germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who has hitherto striven to keep cordial relations with moscow , reacted to the russian decision by saying that while dialogue with the kremlin should continue , the eu can not go back to business as usual with russia . alternative measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : travel restrictions are one of the few steps the eu could take against russia the 27-member bloc has several alternatives at its disposal , analysts say .
it could block russia 's membership of international groups such as the group of eight and the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
the bloc could freeze ongoing talks on the renewal of a wide-ranging eu-russia cooperation agreement ; it could introduce trade sanctions ; and it could refuse to give russian citizens visa-free travel to europe . but even if leaders agree on any retaliatory measures on monday , something that is by no means guaranteed , experts wonder whether these are good enough cards to trump moscow . russia is europe 's biggest energy supplier , its biggest neighbor , a huge and growing market and a key diplomatic player in areas such as afghanistan , the middle east and iran . russian leaders have already shown that they have no qualms about offending european sensibilities , whether by cutting off energy supplies to ukraine -lrb- 2005-06 -rrb- and lithuania -lrb- 2006 -rrb- or vetoing un support for the independence of kosovo -lrb- 2007 -rrb- . in addition , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev have already preempted some of the west 's threats by declaring the g8 " pointless " and questioning whether joining the wto would be in russia 's best interest . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the crowning of barak obama is over , and now is the time for republican john mccain to step into the ring .
for the senior senator from arizona , his party 's convention is all about one thing : distinguishing himself from president george w. bush . mccain ca n't afford to give the impression that his presidency would be identical to bush 's , with a different face .
if he does , he will never be able to pull the middle moderates and liberals to his side .
at the same time , however , the vietnam vet ca n't alienate those bush devotees , which are sure to still exist within the party , causing them to pull their support . hurricane gustav has come to help mccain with this balancing act .
because of the looming crisis , bush has been forced to cancel his trip to the convention , which , incidentally , had only been scheduled a short while ago .
this is good for mccain , because he is striving to be seen as an honest broker and he and bush honestly never liked each other anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz more important for mccain than the support of the white house is the selection of a running mate .
whether or not 44-year-old sarah palin was a good choice remains to be seen .
palin can certainly bring women and , as a conservative moralist , the religious right to the ballot box for mccain . at the same time , however , the governor from alaska is so far removed from world politics that you have to ask yourself : what would happen if she actually had to take over for a geriatric mccain ?
as a former journalist , palin does bring some media experience with her , but the economic experience is lacking . and herein lies a second problem for the mccain campaign .
unlike the democrats , the republicans believe that it ’ s best to let the economy take care of itself .
low taxes and the market ’ s self-healing ability should regulate it , even if the american economy has long been incurring a structural imbalance on a global scale .
who other than the white , male , middleclass homeowner is going to vote for mccain ? but it is just this clientele , who has been hardest hit by the economic downturn .
mccain is going to have to come up with a convincing answer to this at the convention .
resolute stances on foreign policy issues , like the recent crisis between russian and georgia , are one thing .
economic recipes to fight a recession are something else completely . as former president bill clinton once fittingly said during his campaign against bush sr. : it ’ s the economy , stupid .
the economy makes the difference .
this could prove to be true once again this year come nov .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia , in particular the crimea , ukraine and moldova , " he added . even germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who has hitherto striven to keep cordial relations with moscow , reacted to the russian decision by saying that while dialogue with the kremlin should continue , the eu can not go back to business as usual with russia . alternative measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : travel restrictions are one of the few steps the eu could take against russia the 27-member bloc has several alternatives at its disposal , analysts say .

" there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia , in particular the crimea , ukraine and moldova , " he added . even germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who has hitherto striven to keep cordial relations with moscow , reacted to the russian decision by saying that while dialogue with the kremlin should continue , the eu can not go back to business as usual with russia . alternative measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : travel restrictions are one of the few steps the eu could take against russia the 27-member bloc has several alternatives at its disposal , analysts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says germans welcome obama 's choice of biden as vp nominee united states -pipe- 01.09.2008 german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in palin , mccain says he has met his ' soul mate ' us presidential candidate john mccain 's choice of greenhorn alaska governor sarah palin as a running mate took many by surprise .
a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union expects " russia to act responsibly , in line with all its commitments , " according to a statement released on monday .
the bloc will " examine carefully and deeply the situation and the different dimensions of eu-russia relations , " the statement said .
in the meantime , the next round of strategic partnership talks scheduled for sept .
15 have been postponed .
partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .
currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .
" we do n't need these talks or this new agreement any more than the eu does , " russia 's envoy to the eu vladimir chizhov told reporters . eu re-examines russian relations the french leader told the press that a visit to moscow sept .
8 by himself , barroso and eu foreign policy chief javier solana would be " crucial " for relations between the 27-nation bloc and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian separatists wave a kalashnikov and the south ossetian flag , in in tskhinvali sarkozy said russia 's " disproportionate use of force " and its recognition of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia meant the eu had no choice but to re-examine its relationship with russia . " it is clear that in the light of recent events , we can not continue as if nothing has happened , " barroso said . but the leaders decided against imposing any sanctions .
several member states , most notably poland and the baltics , had been pressing for punitive measures against russia , whereas great britain had argued strongly to suspend the partnership talks . " let 's not launch a cold war .
there 's no need to flex our muscles .
demonstrations of force , verbal aggression , sanctions , counter-sanctions ; these will not serve anyone , " sarkozy said .
eu condemns recognition of rebel georgian regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov warned the west against supporting georgia 's leadership at the start of the summit , eu leaders issued a strong condemnation of russia for its recognition of independence for the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " we appeal to other countries not to recognize their proclamation of independence , " they said .
so far , russia is the only country to have recognized the two regions as independent nations .
and only belarus and venezuela have indicated they might do the same .
however russia 's isolation has not stopped president dmitry medvedev from warning the eu that moscow 's decision to recognize the georgian enclaves was " irrevocable . "
revived fears of a new cold war international condemnation has also not stopped moscow from claiming the military intervention as an example of its return to the world stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian honor guards bury soldiers killed during the georgian-russian war " russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said moscow and added that the conflict in georgia had set a new standard for defending moscow 's national interests .
the conflict between georgia and russia has revived fears of a new cold war and has also highlighted deep divisions within the 27-member bloc .
but sarkozy stressed on monday that the eu had shown that it was united .
the president also insisted that the eu should continue to hold dialogue with , rather than isolate , moscow . " we condemn the disproportionate reaction of the russians and we are aware of our responsibilities in keeping dialogue with our russian partner on the rails , " sarkozy said . " we are also aware of the expectations on the georgian side and we will not disappoint them , " he added . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .
he also said the eu was planning to send hundreds of observers to georgia to verify if moscow is implementing the ceasefire agreement . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .
i see his priorities lying in iran , pakistan , russia - the old , well-known hot-spots . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .

he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?

they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .

obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .

with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' germans welcome obama 's choice of biden as vp nominee united states -pipe- 01.09.2008 mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is n't a typical republican john mccain 's nomination is nearly certain , but he 's yet to win his party 's full support .
republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .
i see his priorities lying in iran , pakistan , russia - the old , well-known hot-spots . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .

they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : palin 's lack of economic savvy could hurt mccain john mccain is the presumptive nominee for the republican party .
for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .
from there the artists move on to a final show in lille . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we got the application today .
i found it slightly nasty , " he added . officials and media following the wagner family said they had never heard of richard bauer .
schmid said that if he was genuine , he did n't go about the application process in the right way . keeping it in the family the applicant said his policy was to hand out tickets for free and raise money with a tv series about the wagner family 's turmoil-filled history .
bauer said he would change his surname to " wagner " if given the job . on monday in an email distributed to board members bauer threatened to exercise a wagner descendant right of veto over the appointment of the wagner sisters and to enforce this by court order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the daughter of wieland wagner the decision to award the opera post jointly to katharina and eva and thereby passing over their cousin and rival nike wagner and her business partner gerard mortier came after the board began deliberating over the successor to wolfgang wagner , who stepped down as director at the end of august after 57 years . the bayreuth festival is always run by a wagner descendant . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the crowning of barak obama is over , and now is the time for republican john mccain to step into the ring .
for the senior senator from arizona , his party 's convention is all about one thing : distinguishing himself from president george w. bush . mccain ca n't afford to give the impression that his presidency would be identical to bush 's , with a different face .
if he does , he will never be able to pull the middle moderates and liberals to his side .
at the same time , however , the vietnam vet ca n't alienate those bush devotees , which are sure to still exist within the party , causing them to pull their support . hurricane gustav has come to help mccain with this balancing act .
because of the looming crisis , bush has been forced to cancel his trip to the convention , which , incidentally , had only been scheduled a short while ago .

whether or not 44-year-old sarah palin was a good choice remains to be seen .
palin can certainly bring women and , as a conservative moralist , the religious right to the ballot box for mccain . at the same time , however , the governor from alaska is so far removed from world politics that you have to ask yourself : what would happen if she actually had to take over for a geriatric mccain ?
as a former journalist , palin does bring some media experience with her , but the economic experience is lacking . and herein lies a second problem for the mccain campaign .
unlike the democrats , the republicans believe that it ’ s best to let the economy take care of itself .
low taxes and the market ’ s self-healing ability should regulate it , even if the american economy has long been incurring a structural imbalance on a global scale .
who other than the white , male , middleclass homeowner is going to vote for mccain ? but it is just this clientele , who has been hardest hit by the economic downturn .
mccain is going to have to come up with a convincing answer to this at the convention .

for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the crowning of barak obama is over , and now is the time for republican john mccain to step into the ring .
for the senior senator from arizona , his party 's convention is all about one thing : distinguishing himself from president george w. bush . mccain ca n't afford to give the impression that his presidency would be identical to bush 's , with a different face .
if he does , he will never be able to pull the middle moderates and liberals to his side .
at the same time , however , the vietnam vet ca n't alienate those bush devotees , which are sure to still exist within the party , causing them to pull their support . hurricane gustav has come to help mccain with this balancing act .
because of the looming crisis , bush has been forced to cancel his trip to the convention , which , incidentally , had only been scheduled a short while ago .
this is good for mccain , because he is striving to be seen as an honest broker and he and bush honestly never liked each other anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz more important for mccain than the support of the white house is the selection of a running mate .
whether or not 44-year-old sarah palin was a good choice remains to be seen .
palin can certainly bring women and , as a conservative moralist , the religious right to the ballot box for mccain . at the same time , however , the governor from alaska is so far removed from world politics that you have to ask yourself : what would happen if she actually had to take over for a geriatric mccain ?
as a former journalist , palin does bring some media experience with her , but the economic experience is lacking . and herein lies a second problem for the mccain campaign .
unlike the democrats , the republicans believe that it ’ s best to let the economy take care of itself .
low taxes and the market ’ s self-healing ability should regulate it , even if the american economy has long been incurring a structural imbalance on a global scale .
who other than the white , male , middleclass homeowner is going to vote for mccain ? but it is just this clientele , who has been hardest hit by the economic downturn .
mccain is going to have to come up with a convincing answer to this at the convention .
resolute stances on foreign policy issues , like the recent crisis between russian and georgia , are one thing .
economic recipes to fight a recession are something else completely . as former president bill clinton once fittingly said during his campaign against bush sr. : it ’ s the economy , stupid .
the economy makes the difference .
this could prove to be true once again this year come nov .

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .
from there the artists move on to a final show in lille . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia , in particular the crimea , ukraine and moldova , " he added . even germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who has hitherto striven to keep cordial relations with moscow , reacted to the russian decision by saying that while dialogue with the kremlin should continue , the eu can not go back to business as usual with russia . alternative measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : travel restrictions are one of the few steps the eu could take against russia the 27-member bloc has several alternatives at its disposal , analysts say .
it could block russia 's membership of international groups such as the group of eight and the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
the bloc could freeze ongoing talks on the renewal of a wide-ranging eu-russia cooperation agreement ; it could introduce trade sanctions ; and it could refuse to give russian citizens visa-free travel to europe . but even if leaders agree on any retaliatory measures on monday , something that is by no means guaranteed , experts wonder whether these are good enough cards to trump moscow . russia is europe 's biggest energy supplier , its biggest neighbor , a huge and growing market and a key diplomatic player in areas such as afghanistan , the middle east and iran . russian leaders have already shown that they have no qualms about offending european sensibilities , whether by cutting off energy supplies to ukraine -lrb- 2005-06 -rrb- and lithuania -lrb- 2006 -rrb- or vetoing un support for the independence of kosovo -lrb- 2007 -rrb- . in addition , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev have already preempted some of the west 's threats by declaring the g8 " pointless " and questioning whether joining the wto would be in russia 's best interest . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several of the board members were shocked by the bid . " it sounded to me like a hoax , " said festival board chairman toni schmid , commenting on the bizarre application from a person referring to himself as " richard bauuer , aged 44 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner , left , and eva wagner-pasquier , right other members of the board suggested it might have been a contemporary shock-art " happening " designed to grab media attention from the high-brow opera affair . michael hohl , a board member and mayor of bayreuth where the festival is staged annually , said the application offered neither evidence of bauer 's opera knowledge nor any evidence of his paternity . " we got the application today .
i found it slightly nasty , " he added . officials and media following the wagner family said they had never heard of richard bauer .
schmid said that if he was genuine , he did n't go about the application process in the right way . keeping it in the family the applicant said his policy was to hand out tickets for free and raise money with a tv series about the wagner family 's turmoil-filled history .
bauer said he would change his surname to " wagner " if given the job . on monday in an email distributed to board members bauer threatened to exercise a wagner descendant right of veto over the appointment of the wagner sisters and to enforce this by court order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the daughter of wieland wagner the decision to award the opera post jointly to katharina and eva and thereby passing over their cousin and rival nike wagner and her business partner gerard mortier came after the board began deliberating over the successor to wolfgang wagner , who stepped down as director at the end of august after 57 years . the bayreuth festival is always run by a wagner descendant . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia , in particular the crimea , ukraine and moldova , " he added . even germany 's chancellor angela merkel , who has hitherto striven to keep cordial relations with moscow , reacted to the russian decision by saying that while dialogue with the kremlin should continue , the eu can not go back to business as usual with russia . alternative measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : travel restrictions are one of the few steps the eu could take against russia the 27-member bloc has several alternatives at its disposal , analysts say .
it could block russia 's membership of international groups such as the group of eight and the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
the bloc could freeze ongoing talks on the renewal of a wide-ranging eu-russia cooperation agreement ; it could introduce trade sanctions ; and it could refuse to give russian citizens visa-free travel to europe . but even if leaders agree on any retaliatory measures on monday , something that is by no means guaranteed , experts wonder whether these are good enough cards to trump moscow . russia is europe 's biggest energy supplier , its biggest neighbor , a huge and growing market and a key diplomatic player in areas such as afghanistan , the middle east and iran . russian leaders have already shown that they have no qualms about offending european sensibilities , whether by cutting off energy supplies to ukraine -lrb- 2005-06 -rrb- and lithuania -lrb- 2006 -rrb- or vetoing un support for the independence of kosovo -lrb- 2007 -rrb- . in addition , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev have already preempted some of the west 's threats by declaring the g8 " pointless " and questioning whether joining the wto would be in russia 's best interest . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .

the european union expects " russia to act responsibly , in line with all its commitments , " according to a statement released on monday .
the bloc will " examine carefully and deeply the situation and the different dimensions of eu-russia relations , " the statement said .
in the meantime , the next round of strategic partnership talks scheduled for sept .
15 have been postponed .
partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .
currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .
" we do n't need these talks or this new agreement any more than the eu does , " russia 's envoy to the eu vladimir chizhov told reporters . eu re-examines russian relations the french leader told the press that a visit to moscow sept .
8 by himself , barroso and eu foreign policy chief javier solana would be " crucial " for relations between the 27-nation bloc and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian separatists wave a kalashnikov and the south ossetian flag , in in tskhinvali sarkozy said russia 's " disproportionate use of force " and its recognition of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia meant the eu had no choice but to re-examine its relationship with russia . " it is clear that in the light of recent events , we can not continue as if nothing has happened , " barroso said . but the leaders decided against imposing any sanctions .
several member states , most notably poland and the baltics , had been pressing for punitive measures against russia , whereas great britain had argued strongly to suspend the partnership talks . " let 's not launch a cold war .
there 's no need to flex our muscles .
demonstrations of force , verbal aggression , sanctions , counter-sanctions ; these will not serve anyone , " sarkozy said .
eu condemns recognition of rebel georgian regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov warned the west against supporting georgia 's leadership at the start of the summit , eu leaders issued a strong condemnation of russia for its recognition of independence for the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " we appeal to other countries not to recognize their proclamation of independence , " they said .
so far , russia is the only country to have recognized the two regions as independent nations .
and only belarus and venezuela have indicated they might do the same .
however russia 's isolation has not stopped president dmitry medvedev from warning the eu that moscow 's decision to recognize the georgian enclaves was " irrevocable . "
revived fears of a new cold war international condemnation has also not stopped moscow from claiming the military intervention as an example of its return to the world stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian honor guards bury soldiers killed during the georgian-russian war " russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said moscow and added that the conflict in georgia had set a new standard for defending moscow 's national interests .
the conflict between georgia and russia has revived fears of a new cold war and has also highlighted deep divisions within the 27-member bloc .
but sarkozy stressed on monday that the eu had shown that it was united .
the president also insisted that the eu should continue to hold dialogue with , rather than isolate , moscow . " we condemn the disproportionate reaction of the russians and we are aware of our responsibilities in keeping dialogue with our russian partner on the rails , " sarkozy said . " we are also aware of the expectations on the georgian side and we will not disappoint them , " he added . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .
he also said the eu was planning to send hundreds of observers to georgia to verify if moscow is implementing the ceasefire agreement . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc could freeze ongoing talks on the renewal of a wide-ranging eu-russia cooperation agreement ; it could introduce trade sanctions ; and it could refuse to give russian citizens visa-free travel to europe . but even if leaders agree on any retaliatory measures on monday , something that is by no means guaranteed , experts wonder whether these are good enough cards to trump moscow . russia is europe 's biggest energy supplier , its biggest neighbor , a huge and growing market and a key diplomatic player in areas such as afghanistan , the middle east and iran . russian leaders have already shown that they have no qualms about offending european sensibilities , whether by cutting off energy supplies to ukraine -lrb- 2005-06 -rrb- and lithuania -lrb- 2006 -rrb- or vetoing un support for the independence of kosovo -lrb- 2007 -rrb- . in addition , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev have already preempted some of the west 's threats by declaring the g8 " pointless " and questioning whether joining the wto would be in russia 's best interest . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?

you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .

she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .

she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : palin 's lack of economic savvy could hurt mccain john mccain is the presumptive nominee for the republican party .
for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz .

he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : palin 's lack of economic savvy could hurt mccain john mccain is the presumptive nominee for the republican party .
for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz .
-lrb- 01.09.2008 -rrb- mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert john mccain 's nomination is nearly certain , but he 's yet to win his party 's full support .

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

the european union expects " russia to act responsibly , in line with all its commitments , " according to a statement released on monday .
the bloc will " examine carefully and deeply the situation and the different dimensions of eu-russia relations , " the statement said .
in the meantime , the next round of strategic partnership talks scheduled for sept .
15 have been postponed .
partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .
currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .
" we do n't need these talks or this new agreement any more than the eu does , " russia 's envoy to the eu vladimir chizhov told reporters . eu re-examines russian relations the french leader told the press that a visit to moscow sept .
8 by himself , barroso and eu foreign policy chief javier solana would be " crucial " for relations between the 27-nation bloc and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian separatists wave a kalashnikov and the south ossetian flag , in in tskhinvali sarkozy said russia 's " disproportionate use of force " and its recognition of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia meant the eu had no choice but to re-examine its relationship with russia . " it is clear that in the light of recent events , we can not continue as if nothing has happened , " barroso said . but the leaders decided against imposing any sanctions .
several member states , most notably poland and the baltics , had been pressing for punitive measures against russia , whereas great britain had argued strongly to suspend the partnership talks . " let 's not launch a cold war .
there 's no need to flex our muscles .
demonstrations of force , verbal aggression , sanctions , counter-sanctions ; these will not serve anyone , " sarkozy said .
eu condemns recognition of rebel georgian regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov warned the west against supporting georgia 's leadership at the start of the summit , eu leaders issued a strong condemnation of russia for its recognition of independence for the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " we appeal to other countries not to recognize their proclamation of independence , " they said .
so far , russia is the only country to have recognized the two regions as independent nations .
and only belarus and venezuela have indicated they might do the same .
however russia 's isolation has not stopped president dmitry medvedev from warning the eu that moscow 's decision to recognize the georgian enclaves was " irrevocable . "
revived fears of a new cold war international condemnation has also not stopped moscow from claiming the military intervention as an example of its return to the world stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian honor guards bury soldiers killed during the georgian-russian war " russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said moscow and added that the conflict in georgia had set a new standard for defending moscow 's national interests .
the conflict between georgia and russia has revived fears of a new cold war and has also highlighted deep divisions within the 27-member bloc .
but sarkozy stressed on monday that the eu had shown that it was united .
the president also insisted that the eu should continue to hold dialogue with , rather than isolate , moscow . " we condemn the disproportionate reaction of the russians and we are aware of our responsibilities in keeping dialogue with our russian partner on the rails , " sarkozy said . " we are also aware of the expectations on the georgian side and we will not disappoint them , " he added . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .
he also said the eu was planning to send hundreds of observers to georgia to verify if moscow is implementing the ceasefire agreement . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are to succeed their father , wolfgang wagner who officially retired sunday . competing against them was their estranged cousin , nike wagner , who was allied with opera chief and future new york city opera director gerhard mortier .
nike wagner is the daughter of wolfgang wagner ’ s brother , wieland , who died in 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner kunstfest weimar nike wagner said in a statement that the procedure was very outlandish .
she stated that she was sad about the outcome , but hopes that her cousins take the suggestions offered by her and gerard mortier . “ i wish them lots of luck , ” she added . wolf siegfried wagner , nike ’ s brother , refused to comment on behalf of the wieland wagner family . the future of bayreuth the two great-granddaughters of richard wagner will now enter into contract negotiations .
unlike their father , they will not be offered lifelong contracts .
additionally the controlling share of the bayreuth festival gmbh , which was owned by wolfgang wagner , will be divided equally among the members of the board of directors . " a joint management of the festival by both daughters of wolfgang wagner represents both the future and continuity of the festival , " said thomas goppel , culture minister in the state of bavaria , which holds seats on the festival 's stiftungsrat or board .
toni schmid , head of the stiftungsrat , told a news conference that 22 members of the board had voted for eva and katharina , and none against .

several of the board members were shocked by the bid . " it sounded to me like a hoax , " said festival board chairman toni schmid , commenting on the bizarre application from a person referring to himself as " richard bauuer , aged 44 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner , left , and eva wagner-pasquier , right other members of the board suggested it might have been a contemporary shock-art " happening " designed to grab media attention from the high-brow opera affair . michael hohl , a board member and mayor of bayreuth where the festival is staged annually , said the application offered neither evidence of bauer 's opera knowledge nor any evidence of his paternity . " we got the application today .
i found it slightly nasty , " he added . officials and media following the wagner family said they had never heard of richard bauer .
schmid said that if he was genuine , he did n't go about the application process in the right way . keeping it in the family the applicant said his policy was to hand out tickets for free and raise money with a tv series about the wagner family 's turmoil-filled history .
bauer said he would change his surname to " wagner " if given the job . on monday in an email distributed to board members bauer threatened to exercise a wagner descendant right of veto over the appointment of the wagner sisters and to enforce this by court order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the daughter of wieland wagner the decision to award the opera post jointly to katharina and eva and thereby passing over their cousin and rival nike wagner and her business partner gerard mortier came after the board began deliberating over the successor to wolfgang wagner , who stepped down as director at the end of august after 57 years . the bayreuth festival is always run by a wagner descendant . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .
for the next month it will reside at the hansa coking plant in dortmund , surrounded by the hulking machines and the smell of industry .
from there the artists move on to a final show in lille . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .
in short , tangle troubles that are hair today could be gone tomorrow . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .

partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .
currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 01.09.2008 artists turn industrial fuel into works of art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's palette the industrial areas of germany , france and poland have all been fueled by one thing : coal .
now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

as a former journalist , palin does bring some media experience with her , but the economic experience is lacking . and herein lies a second problem for the mccain campaign .
unlike the democrats , the republicans believe that it ’ s best to let the economy take care of itself .

who other than the white , male , middleclass homeowner is going to vote for mccain ? but it is just this clientele , who has been hardest hit by the economic downturn .
mccain is going to have to come up with a convincing answer to this at the convention .
resolute stances on foreign policy issues , like the recent crisis between russian and georgia , are one thing .
economic recipes to fight a recession are something else completely . as former president bill clinton once fittingly said during his campaign against bush sr. : it ’ s the economy , stupid .

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : palin 's lack of economic savvy could hurt mccain john mccain is the presumptive nominee for the republican party .

is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .

so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .

now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .
today the buildings stand as they did at the height of production , only now the hulking machines are silent and coke no longer pours forth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hansa coking plant has been out of operation since 1992 a byproduct of hard coal , coke is created by heating the coal to over 1,000 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,823 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in airless furnaces for 20 hours .
the grey chunks of highly carbonized matter that emerge are most commonly used for fueling blast furnaces in the industrial production of pig iron . at one time , up to 1,000 people were employed at the plant , and while preserving the industrial relic may seem a strange idea to some , the buildings are an important means of remembering the past , according to meike kieslich , a spokesperson for the foundation . " some people want to tear them down , but they ’ re a part of our history and we have to keep them or we 'll lose that history , " she said . this former coking plant is now the setting for an unusual art exhibition called coal - from carboniferous to open-eyed artists on landscape .
a total of 18 artists - six each from germany , poland and france - spent a week in the coal mining regions of each of those nations . looking for a way to use coal as an inspiration for art , their research took them deep into coal mines and the social and economic situation of the three communities . musical coal the black noise exhibit , created by clea coudsi and eric herbin of lille , france , gives voice to 14 chunks of coal .
collected from mines in germany , france and poland then planted on rods attached to small motors , the coal is grazed by a long piece of metal attached to a small speaker - which creates a kind of coal symphony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spinning coal makes music in " black noise " coudsi and herbin came up with idea after learning that scientists in china used a similar method to listen to ming vases .
the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .
" all the coal mines will be closed . " our past is their future the contrasts in how each of the countries ' use of coal and coal mines led to the exhibit 's creation , according to ute schmidt and richard ortmann from the kulturhaus neuasseln in dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition has been set up in and on the buildings or the hansa coking plant vacationing in the coal mining region of poland , they came across the coal production sites and were moved by the idea that something that was part of their past could be simultaneously a part of someone else 's future , schmidt said . " the exhibition was based on the idea that artists in the program would be able to see the same places and have the same experiences , and then turn these experiences into art , " schmidt said . the exhibition has already been held in poland .

the european union expects " russia to act responsibly , in line with all its commitments , " according to a statement released on monday .
the bloc will " examine carefully and deeply the situation and the different dimensions of eu-russia relations , " the statement said .
in the meantime , the next round of strategic partnership talks scheduled for sept .
15 have been postponed .
partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .

" we got the application today .
i found it slightly nasty , " he added . officials and media following the wagner family said they had never heard of richard bauer .
schmid said that if he was genuine , he did n't go about the application process in the right way . keeping it in the family the applicant said his policy was to hand out tickets for free and raise money with a tv series about the wagner family 's turmoil-filled history .
bauer said he would change his surname to " wagner " if given the job . on monday in an email distributed to board members bauer threatened to exercise a wagner descendant right of veto over the appointment of the wagner sisters and to enforce this by court order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the daughter of wieland wagner the decision to award the opera post jointly to katharina and eva and thereby passing over their cousin and rival nike wagner and her business partner gerard mortier came after the board began deliberating over the successor to wolfgang wagner , who stepped down as director at the end of august after 57 years . the bayreuth festival is always run by a wagner descendant . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .

thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .

we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .

29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

nagged by knots ?
troubled by tangles ?
thanks to some german chemists working in the new field of haptics , those bad-hair days may be a thing of the past . unless you are bald or nearly so , you have probably had a morning like this at least once .
the clock is ticking as you hurry to get ready to go outside . but wait - the comb gets tangled in your unruly mane , which refuses to lie flat .
or conversely , your hopes for a full-bodied style are foiled when your locks refuse to be styled , and stay plastered to your head in lank strands instead .
hair products , styling wands , straightening irons - you pull out the whole arsenal , to no avail .
frustration builds , the mood goes sour .
eventually , you give up .
you pull out a scarf , or a cap , or both .
or maybe you just stay at home .
move over , amy winehouse .
you 're having a bad hair day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse : proactive on bad hair now , a pair of fearless german research chemists have taken it upon themselves to save people , if not from a fate worse than death , then at least from the occasional ruined morning .
new scientific methods using methods from the relatively new science of haptics - that is , how the subjective perception of touch connects to objective surface properties of hair and other materials - .they have developed the first detailed microscopic analysis of what happens to individual hair fibers when they get tangled up and wo n't let go .
the chemists from the university of bayreuth claim their research could pave the way to the development of improved shampoos , conditioners and other products for repairing damaged hair , according to the findings which were presented at the american chemical society 's 236th acs national meeting in philadelphia .
in the new study , the researchers invented a unique technology for analyzing hair that involves mounting individual hair fibers on a cantilevered tip of an atomic-force microscope and measuring their interactions as they touch each other .
two reasons for bad hair " the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair-care products affect hair-to-hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion , " says study co-author eva max , a doctoral student in chemistry at the university of bayreuth in germany .
max said her findings showed that hair feels rough and difficult to comb for two main reasons .
on the one hand , mechanical damage to a hair 's surface creates scaly projections that jut out at perpendicular angles to other hair fibers .
when hair fibers slide past each other , these scales create more friction than smooth hairs , causing a rough feel and making hair more difficult to comb .
on the other hand , chemical changes also occur when hair fibers interact .
negative charges build up on the surface of hair that causes repulsion between single hairs .
this repulsion causes friction and makes hair rough and difficult to comb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a really , really good hair day to solve the problem , positively-charged polymers that neutralize the negatively charged surfaces are included in conditioner formula to provide a silky feel to hair .
but finding the right formula for repairing damaged hair is no easy task , notes dr. claudia wood , a senior scientist at basf in bayreuth , germany .
in addition to hair interactions , many other external factors , such as humidity , water content of hair , and hair stickiness , all affect hair quality .
the key to repairing these processes is to find the right ratio of beneficial components in a conditioner or shampoo that optimize hair feel , max and colleagues say .
they expect their new , haptics-based method will allow developers of hair care products to achieve this goal more easily , giving consumers a more reliable product .

the bloc will " examine carefully and deeply the situation and the different dimensions of eu-russia relations , " the statement said .

partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .
currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .
" we do n't need these talks or this new agreement any more than the eu does , " russia 's envoy to the eu vladimir chizhov told reporters . eu re-examines russian relations the french leader told the press that a visit to moscow sept .

" it is clear that in the light of recent events , we can not continue as if nothing has happened , " barroso said . but the leaders decided against imposing any sanctions .
several member states , most notably poland and the baltics , had been pressing for punitive measures against russia , whereas great britain had argued strongly to suspend the partnership talks . " let 's not launch a cold war .
there 's no need to flex our muscles .
demonstrations of force , verbal aggression , sanctions , counter-sanctions ; these will not serve anyone , " sarkozy said .
eu condemns recognition of rebel georgian regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov warned the west against supporting georgia 's leadership at the start of the summit , eu leaders issued a strong condemnation of russia for its recognition of independence for the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " we appeal to other countries not to recognize their proclamation of independence , " they said .
so far , russia is the only country to have recognized the two regions as independent nations .
and only belarus and venezuela have indicated they might do the same .
however russia 's isolation has not stopped president dmitry medvedev from warning the eu that moscow 's decision to recognize the georgian enclaves was " irrevocable . "
revived fears of a new cold war international condemnation has also not stopped moscow from claiming the military intervention as an example of its return to the world stage .

the conflict between georgia and russia has revived fears of a new cold war and has also highlighted deep divisions within the 27-member bloc .
but sarkozy stressed on monday that the eu had shown that it was united .
the president also insisted that the eu should continue to hold dialogue with , rather than isolate , moscow . " we condemn the disproportionate reaction of the russians and we are aware of our responsibilities in keeping dialogue with our russian partner on the rails , " sarkozy said . " we are also aware of the expectations on the georgian side and we will not disappoint them , " he added . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .

the european union expects " russia to act responsibly , in line with all its commitments , " according to a statement released on monday .
the bloc will " examine carefully and deeply the situation and the different dimensions of eu-russia relations , " the statement said .
in the meantime , the next round of strategic partnership talks scheduled for sept .
15 have been postponed .
partnership talks postponed pending troop withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and eu commissioner barroso " as long as the withdrawal of -lrb- russian -rrb- troops has not been respected , all meetings on the partnership accord are postponed , " european commission presidnet jose manuel barroso said at the conclusion of the summit .
the european union and russia had launched negotiations in july for the new strategic partnership pact , which aims to update and upgrade the framework for their relations in the energy sector and on trade .
currently , their relations are governed by a partnership accord that dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . " the eu would welcome a real partnership with russia , which is in the interests of all , but you have to be two to have a partnership , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently heads the rotating eu presidency . however , russian officials have in the past been less than enthusiastic about the long-delayed pact .
" we do n't need these talks or this new agreement any more than the eu does , " russia 's envoy to the eu vladimir chizhov told reporters . eu re-examines russian relations the french leader told the press that a visit to moscow sept .
8 by himself , barroso and eu foreign policy chief javier solana would be " crucial " for relations between the 27-nation bloc and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian separatists wave a kalashnikov and the south ossetian flag , in in tskhinvali sarkozy said russia 's " disproportionate use of force " and its recognition of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia meant the eu had no choice but to re-examine its relationship with russia . " it is clear that in the light of recent events , we can not continue as if nothing has happened , " barroso said . but the leaders decided against imposing any sanctions .
several member states , most notably poland and the baltics , had been pressing for punitive measures against russia , whereas great britain had argued strongly to suspend the partnership talks . " let 's not launch a cold war .
there 's no need to flex our muscles .
demonstrations of force , verbal aggression , sanctions , counter-sanctions ; these will not serve anyone , " sarkozy said .
eu condemns recognition of rebel georgian regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov warned the west against supporting georgia 's leadership at the start of the summit , eu leaders issued a strong condemnation of russia for its recognition of independence for the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " we appeal to other countries not to recognize their proclamation of independence , " they said .
so far , russia is the only country to have recognized the two regions as independent nations .
and only belarus and venezuela have indicated they might do the same .
however russia 's isolation has not stopped president dmitry medvedev from warning the eu that moscow 's decision to recognize the georgian enclaves was " irrevocable . "
revived fears of a new cold war international condemnation has also not stopped moscow from claiming the military intervention as an example of its return to the world stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian honor guards bury soldiers killed during the georgian-russian war " russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said moscow and added that the conflict in georgia had set a new standard for defending moscow 's national interests .
the conflict between georgia and russia has revived fears of a new cold war and has also highlighted deep divisions within the 27-member bloc .
but sarkozy stressed on monday that the eu had shown that it was united .
the president also insisted that the eu should continue to hold dialogue with , rather than isolate , moscow . " we condemn the disproportionate reaction of the russians and we are aware of our responsibilities in keeping dialogue with our russian partner on the rails , " sarkozy said . " we are also aware of the expectations on the georgian side and we will not disappoint them , " he added . on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu is getting ready to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people , solana said .
he also said the eu was planning to send hundreds of observers to georgia to verify if moscow is implementing the ceasefire agreement . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a group of international artists are using the fuel to spark dialogue . the hansa coking plant is just six kilometers -lrb- 3.7 miles -rrb- north of the industrial german city of dortmund .
shuttered for over 16 years , the site was once the country 's largest coke producer . in 1997 the site was taken over by the foundation for the preservation of industrial monuments .

the scientists wanted to hear people from the ming dynasty trapped in the pottery , coudsi said . " the idea came because pieces of coal are so old and there are generations and generations trapped inside it , " added herbin . the project strikes a vein particularly close to herbin .
growing up in the french mining region of nord-pas de calais , many of herbin 's relatives , including his grandfather and several uncles , spent lifetimes in the mines .
when he told his family what he would be doing , some were proud , while others were puzzled . " some of them said to me , ' why would you want to go down in a mine just to look around ? '
it made no sense to them , " herbin said . a three-dimensional timeline unlike regions the artists visited in france and germany , coal mining is still in full swing in poland 's upper silesia region . this was the most impressive part of the experience for szymon gdowicz , an artist from katowice , poland .
seeing the abandoned mines in germany and france 's reclaimed mines covered in flowers and trees was like looking at the future of his country , he said . " one day it will be like it is here in germany , " he said , alluding to the idle german plants .

for his running mate , he has chosen sarah palin , a governor with little political experience , and this may be his downfall , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the crowning of barak obama is over , and now is the time for republican john mccain to step into the ring .
for the senior senator from arizona , his party 's convention is all about one thing : distinguishing himself from president george w. bush . mccain ca n't afford to give the impression that his presidency would be identical to bush 's , with a different face .
if he does , he will never be able to pull the middle moderates and liberals to his side .
at the same time , however , the vietnam vet ca n't alienate those bush devotees , which are sure to still exist within the party , causing them to pull their support . hurricane gustav has come to help mccain with this balancing act .
because of the looming crisis , bush has been forced to cancel his trip to the convention , which , incidentally , had only been scheduled a short while ago .

palin can certainly bring women and , as a conservative moralist , the religious right to the ballot box for mccain . at the same time , however , the governor from alaska is so far removed from world politics that you have to ask yourself : what would happen if she actually had to take over for a geriatric mccain ?
as a former journalist , palin does bring some media experience with her , but the economic experience is lacking . and herein lies a second problem for the mccain campaign .
unlike the democrats , the republicans believe that it ’ s best to let the economy take care of itself .
low taxes and the market ’ s self-healing ability should regulate it , even if the american economy has long been incurring a structural imbalance on a global scale .

mccain is going to have to come up with a convincing answer to this at the convention .

republicans tend toward unilateralism , but mccain as president could have perks for germany , says expert stormy-annika mildner . stormy-annika mildner is an expert on trans-atlantic relations and foreign trade policy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
dw-world.de : it seems likely that john mccain will win the republican nomination , but do you think he can win the support of his own party ? stormy-annika mildner : first of all , it really does look very likely that he 's going to get the nomination because he 's already won 707 delegates and he only needs 1,191 to be nominated .
but it 's a bit more difficult to say if he is going to be able to win the presidency because it 's not so clear whether he 'll get the conservative republican vote . he 's been considered divisive in his own party .
do you think that his nomination - or even his presidency - would mean a shift for the conservatives ?
or will he remain an exception within the conservative forces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitt romney has withdrawn from the republican race he is definitely more on the liberal side of the republican party and therefore an exception .
but to win the election , he does need the republican base .
and thus he needs to convince the conservatives that he 's conservative enough for them .
his record is not that clear . to give you a couple of examples : he 's voted against bush 's tax cuts , he 's voted for an immigration law that would make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal , he 's supported stricter environmental regulation .
he 's also supported embryonic stem cell research and he 's championed stricter campaign finance rules .
that really does not make him a perfect candidate for the conservatives . in the next weeks , or even days , he must rally around that group , including the christian right , and convince them that he is the right candidate for them . so you do n't think he represents a trend to the center for the republicans ? no , i do n't think so .
in both parties , there have always been candidates who 've leaned more to the right , the middle or the left .
this time , the republicans had two candidates on the conservative side , especially -lsb- mike -rsb- huckabee .
mccain is a little bit more on the liberal side - although he 's shifted quite a bit to the right in the last few weeks .
so i would say that this reflects the usual spectrum within the republican party . what do you think a victory for mccain would mean for trans-atlantic relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans tend to be more isolationist than democrats first of all , i would say that the republicans ' motto is " going together where we must , but going alone where we can . "
for the democrats , it would be the opposite : " going together where we can , but going alone where we must . "
they put a greater emphasis on multi-lateral institutions , while the republicans emphasize unilateralism a bit more , as we have seen in the past .
a democratic president could tend to be easier to cooperate with . however , if you talked to people in the german government , the preference is not that clear cut .
a lot of policymakers actually prefer the foreign policy specialist mccain because he 's well aware of the problems in the world and he 's dealt with them before .
obama is more a newcomer - he 's a wild card and we do n't really know which direction he 'll go . another area of great importance for us , since germany is so dependent on international trade , is the trans-atlantic trade relationship .
in this area , obama - but also -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton - would definitely be more difficult to deal with .
they have a more protectionist rhetoric ; they favor free trade less than mccain .
with mccain , i think that the trans-atlantic economic partnership would have better prospects than under obama or clinton . unlike the democratic candidates , mccain has been adamant about carrying on the war on terror .
do you see that as being problematic for germany in particular ?
would he continue demands that germany send more troops to afghanistan , for example ? i think that no matter which candidate wins , there will be greater demands on germany to take on a greater responsibility in the world : for example , sending more combat troops to afghanistan .
however , the likelihood that a democrat would have greater demands on germany is higher , which brings me back to the motto i mentioned before .
and that would , without doubt , be problematic for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expected to take on more responsbilities on the global stage some of the key issues facing europe right now - like the darfur crisis or environmental protection - do n't top america 's political agenda .
do you see mccain potentially playing a key role on any of these topics ? mccain does have quite a few ideas on the environment , the climate and energy security .
i think that there are great chances in this area for closer cooperation between europe and the united states . with regard to other areas , i ca n't see africa being a priority for a republican president .
i see his priorities lying in iran , pakistan , russia - the old , well-known hot-spots . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert on us politics called the choice " risky , but very good . " on friday , aug .
29 , 2008 , republican presidential candidate john mccain surprised observers with his choice for vice presidential running mate .
alaska governor sarah palin is a 44-year-old evangelical christian and a mother of five , who takes a strong anti-abortion stance .
her rise through the ranks of politics - from small town mayor to maverick governor to candidate for high national office - has been meteoric . josef braml , an expert on us affairs with the independent think tank german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , said mccain 's choice was unexpected , but inspired : it enabled the candidate to avoid some political pitfalls , take on the mantle of change , and open up the republican tent in one fell swoop . dw-world.de : what do you make of john mccain 's choice of sarah palin ? josef braml : the longer i think about it the more i become convinced that he made a risky , but very good choice . why ? he had to walk a thin line .
he did n't want to become beholden to the christian right - it would have alienated independent voters , where he is also very strong .
but on the other hand he has to please the christian right .
we should n't forget that four out of 10 voters for george w. bush were from the christian right , and they needed to be made happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin visited troops in kuwait in july , 2007 ms. palin is obviously the perfect choice for that .
she not only stands for the right to life , but her own life exemplifies that .
she gave birth to a child when she already knew it would have down syndrome .
some women may have aborted that child , but she did n't .
that is very important for true believers on the christian right . it was an important choice because the republican tent is big and this way , mccain can make them all happy . how did mccain avoid alienating independents ? he did n't go full-blast for the christian right .
he could have picked , say , minnesota governor tim pawlenty .
he is definitely one of -lrb- the pro-life camp 's -rrb- standard bearers .
but that would have been too close to the christian right . picking a woman who lives up to their values , a role model , and a mother they really like - that 's a trick for both constituencies . in her speech welcoming the nomination , sarah palin was full of praise for hillary clinton . observers thought she might be making a bid for disenfranchised hillary voters .
is that a clever strategy ? i do n't think so .
this hillary clinton analysis - that palin is trying to get votes from her - contradicts everything i just said .
this is a struggle for values-voters .
hillary clinton 's voters are on the opposite side of the culture war from sarah palin 's voters . hillary voters are for the right to choose -lrb- in the abortion debate -rrb- .
they may not like it , but -lrb- since mccain nominated palin -rrb- they have one more reason to vote for obama .
they will have to go to him to avoid having mccain nominate a supreme court justice who could swing the court and overturn roe v. wade . after she was named , some republicans appeared to be trying to add gravitas to palin 's resume by stressing her role as the leader of the alaskan national guard … will mccain 's choice of running mate affect foreign policy ? this is the only downside i see in the choice of palin .
mccain 's argument against barack obama is now void .
he can no longer accuse obama of not having enough foreign policy experience , when sarah palin - who has no foreign policy experience at all - may be a " heartbeat away " from the presidency , as americans say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young sarah was a local beauty pageant winner she has been mayor of a small town , and is a first-term governor of a state that does n't have much to do with foreign policy , to say the least .
so i do n't see his line of attack against obama being that valid anymore . so does mccain 's choice make sense as a political move , considering all the weight being put on the international relations right now ? i gather that mccain may have realized the theme of " change " resonates better than the theme of " experience , " which hilary clinton realized before him . remember early in the campaign , when hillary was banking on experience , and came in with madeleine albright and all the experienced hands ?
and then when she lost the first primaries , well , you did n't see much of madeleine albright anymore .
you saw young people . now mccain has figured out that the theme of change resonates well at a time when almost two-thirds of the country are sick of the current president , and 8 out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track . he has chosen a young face , a dynamic face , somebody who can go against washington , against pork barreling , against all the things even republican voters are sick and tired of . it was a good choice , in that it covers up his weaknesses , because he has been in washington a long time , too . now both candidates have chosen their number-two .
who made a smarter choice , mccain or obama ? i think highly of joe biden as a foreign-policy maker .
he has a strong record .
but i 'm not sure he is the perfect choice for a presidential candidate who wants to be commander-in-chief himself .
he may remind too many people of the acting president .
he did n't have much experience either , and he picked dick cheney . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palin 's husband , todd , is a commercial fisherman i think -lrb- obama 's choice -rrb- is more showing people his weak spot than covering up for his weakness . … it contradicts the theme of change , to have a guy next to him who was doing foreign policy before obama himself even went to college . in her first speech as mccain 's running mate , palin stressed her pride in her 19-year-old son , who is going to fight in iraq .
she was quite patriotic and pro-military .
her tone put mccain 's campaign in a different light than obama 's , which seems to be about stressing diplomacy and bridge-building .
will mccain 's choice impact the us image overseas ? i would n't listen to sarah palin 's speech to figure out what us foreign policy will be all about .
she is nominated for vice president and she wo n't be dick cheney , because of her lack of experience . i see why mccain chose her - like i said , it has to do with electoral calculations .
but if you look at both candidates carefully , you see there is actually not much foreign policy difference between them . mccain speaks bluntly about the alliance of democracies , which is n't very popular here in europe .
if you examine the speech obama made in germany , you see … he did n't once utter the word united nations .
knowing that germans love the un , that may be a message in itself . obama said nato was the greatest alliance we ever had .
but many europeans do n't like the idea of a global nato .
he more or less said an indirect version of what mccain has said more bluntly . does mccain send a message about energy policy by picking a running mate from alaska , where offshore drilling is such a contested issue ? john mccain has had to walk a thin line , and he has caused a few hard feelings . on the one side , he is for a change of energy policies .
he realizes america can not drill its way out of this problem - as even some billionaires like t. boone pickens admit now .
they are now seeing a line of business in windmills and solar parks .
so you have business-minded republicans who already realize the trend of the future . but there are still some traditional oil republicans and they needed to be pleased as well .
so again , this pick gives both sides some credit . with a little over two months to go and both tickets in place , how would you call this election ? it depends entirely on external events .
if there is a security problem , mccain has the better chance .
if the situation is more or less the same , it will be " the economy , stupid , " and obama will have a leg up . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gruber -rrb- : german symphony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hk gruber both arranged and conducted the symphony a performance that goes under the skin : the concert of the beethoven orchestra and the philharmonic chorus of bonn on was directly connected to this year 's festival theme : power and music . hanns eisler , the composer of the national anthem of the german democratic republic -lrb- former east germany -rrb- , based the work on texts by bertold brecht dealing with the war and nazi terror .
impressive choruses and solo vocal sections drastically depict not only the suffering of jews in the concentration camps but also the fate of soldiers abused as cannon fodder and sent back to the homeland in tin coffins .
hk gruber , austrian composer and the conductor of this performance , combined eisler 's " german symphony " with music by kurt weill and one of his own orchestral works , entitled " charivari . "
the name translates roughly as " caterwauling . "
in the deconstruction of a polka melody , the work refers to the co-responsibility of austrians for war and terror . dw staff -lrb- gs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr ghaffur is taking legal action against sir ian and a junior colleague , deputy assistant commissioner richard bryan .
he is alleging that he was effectively sidelined by sir ian .
among the pages of complaints , mr ghaffur says he was asked to carry out an investigation into why a black man , delroy lindo , was stopped 37 times and charged with 17 offences but never convicted .
the employment tribunal claim says mr ghaffur 's conclusion that mr lindo was a victim of harassment was unacceptable to sir ian .
mr ghaffur says he was asked by sir ian to withdraw the findings .
when mr ghaffur refused he says it was rewritten by a third party and he was not permitted any further involvement in the case .
the employment tribunal is expected to take place next year .

scientists now estimate that nearly one-third of all species are threatened by extinction and populations are falling rapidly .
a deadly fungus has been held up as one of the prime suspects for the crash in numbers - but where did it come from , how did it take hold and what can be done about it ?
what is the chytrid fungus ?
what does it do ?
batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was only discovered in 1998 .
the harlequin toad has been badly hit by the chytrid fungus two teams of researchers investigating the huge number of frog deaths in central america and australia isolated the fungus and discovered that it could have a deadly effect if frogs became infected with it .
it belongs to a family of fungi known as the chytrids -lrb- batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is also commonly referred to as the chytrid fungus -rrb- .
chytrid species are extremely widespread - they are found in the soil and play a key role in the ecosystem , breaking down matter so its nutrients can be released back into the earth .
scientists set for frog hunt batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is the first chytrid that has been shown to be deadly to vertebrates .
in many amphibians , the fungus can cause a disease called chytridiomycosis .
it infects the animals ' skin , causing skin lesions , effectively suffocating them .
it takes between one to two weeks for the frogs to die .
not all amphibians develop the disease .
some species can carry and spread the fungus without developing any symptoms .
where did it come from ?
scientists are not sure where the fungus came from , and are currently investigating two possibilities .
jon bielby , an amphibian expert from the zoological society of london , explains : " one hypothesis is that is was that was already all over the place - and it could be that something suddenly changed , like the weather , causing amphibians to become more vulnerable to the fungus or the fungus to become more pathogenic . "
this is called the " endemic pathogen hypothesis " .
the other is described as the " naïve pathogen hypothesis " .
dr bielbly said : " this is the idea that it came from one area and then spread all around the world - and because it is being introduced to populations that have never seen the fungus before - naïve populations - it has a serious effect .
" the evidence at the moment seems to favour this slightly - the first records of the fungus go back to southern africa in the 1920s . "
around this time , he said , an aquatic amphibian called the xenopus toad , that was native to the area , was being exported all over the world for use in pregnancy tests - certain hormones only found in pregnant females make the amphibian spawn .
this toad is able to carry - and spread - the fungus without suffering any ill effects .
dr bielby added : " this was a possible way that it spread from south africa . "
where can it be found ?
the fungus is now found all over the world .
the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis mapping project says that it has been so far been detected in 38 countries and in more than 250 amphibian species what can be done ?
batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can be killed off very easily using fungicides .
the american bullfrog seems to be able to spread the fungus while this is good news for captive amphibians , treating populations with this method in the wild would be impossible , so scientists are now looking at ways to stem the spread .
there are calls for more stringent rules on importing and exporting amphibians , which may soon be put into place .
some countries , such as the uk , are also trying to eradicate invasive amphibians such as the north american bullfrog , which is able to carry the fungus and spread it to other more susceptible animals .

jon bielby , an amphibian expert from the zoological society of london , explains : " one hypothesis is that is was that was already all over the place - and it could be that something suddenly changed , like the weather , causing amphibians to become more vulnerable to the fungus or the fungus to become more pathogenic . "
this is called the " endemic pathogen hypothesis " .
the other is described as the " naïve pathogen hypothesis " .
dr bielbly said : " this is the idea that it came from one area and then spread all around the world - and because it is being introduced to populations that have never seen the fungus before - naïve populations - it has a serious effect .
" the evidence at the moment seems to favour this slightly - the first records of the fungus go back to southern africa in the 1920s . "
around this time , he said , an aquatic amphibian called the xenopus toad , that was native to the area , was being exported all over the world for use in pregnancy tests - certain hormones only found in pregnant females make the amphibian spawn .
this toad is able to carry - and spread - the fungus without suffering any ill effects .
dr bielby added : " this was a possible way that it spread from south africa . "
where can it be found ?
the fungus is now found all over the world .
the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis mapping project says that it has been so far been detected in 38 countries and in more than 250 amphibian species what can be done ?
batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can be killed off very easily using fungicides .
the american bullfrog seems to be able to spread the fungus while this is good news for captive amphibians , treating populations with this method in the wild would be impossible , so scientists are now looking at ways to stem the spread .
there are calls for more stringent rules on importing and exporting amphibians , which may soon be put into place .
some countries , such as the uk , are also trying to eradicate invasive amphibians such as the north american bullfrog , which is able to carry the fungus and spread it to other more susceptible animals .

scientists now estimate that nearly one-third of all species are threatened by extinction and populations are falling rapidly .
a deadly fungus has been held up as one of the prime suspects for the crash in numbers - but where did it come from , how did it take hold and what can be done about it ?
what is the chytrid fungus ?
what does it do ?
batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was only discovered in 1998 .
the harlequin toad has been badly hit by the chytrid fungus two teams of researchers investigating the huge number of frog deaths in central america and australia isolated the fungus and discovered that it could have a deadly effect if frogs became infected with it .
it belongs to a family of fungi known as the chytrids -lrb- batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is also commonly referred to as the chytrid fungus -rrb- .
chytrid species are extremely widespread - they are found in the soil and play a key role in the ecosystem , breaking down matter so its nutrients can be released back into the earth .
scientists set for frog hunt batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is the first chytrid that has been shown to be deadly to vertebrates .
in many amphibians , the fungus can cause a disease called chytridiomycosis .
it infects the animals ' skin , causing skin lesions , effectively suffocating them .
it takes between one to two weeks for the frogs to die .
not all amphibians develop the disease .
some species can carry and spread the fungus without developing any symptoms .
where did it come from ?
scientists are not sure where the fungus came from , and are currently investigating two possibilities .
jon bielby , an amphibian expert from the zoological society of london , explains : " one hypothesis is that is was that was already all over the place - and it could be that something suddenly changed , like the weather , causing amphibians to become more vulnerable to the fungus or the fungus to become more pathogenic . "
this is called the " endemic pathogen hypothesis " .
the other is described as the " naïve pathogen hypothesis " .
dr bielbly said : " this is the idea that it came from one area and then spread all around the world - and because it is being introduced to populations that have never seen the fungus before - naïve populations - it has a serious effect .
" the evidence at the moment seems to favour this slightly - the first records of the fungus go back to southern africa in the 1920s . "
around this time , he said , an aquatic amphibian called the xenopus toad , that was native to the area , was being exported all over the world for use in pregnancy tests - certain hormones only found in pregnant females make the amphibian spawn .
this toad is able to carry - and spread - the fungus without suffering any ill effects .
dr bielby added : " this was a possible way that it spread from south africa . "
where can it be found ?
the fungus is now found all over the world .
the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis mapping project says that it has been so far been detected in 38 countries and in more than 250 amphibian species what can be done ?
batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can be killed off very easily using fungicides .
the american bullfrog seems to be able to spread the fungus while this is good news for captive amphibians , treating populations with this method in the wild would be impossible , so scientists are now looking at ways to stem the spread .
there are calls for more stringent rules on importing and exporting amphibians , which may soon be put into place .
some countries , such as the uk , are also trying to eradicate invasive amphibians such as the north american bullfrog , which is able to carry the fungus and spread it to other more susceptible animals .

a team from manchester university and chester zoo are in costa rica to track down the highly endangered creatures .
bbc news will follow their trek deep into the cloud forests of monteverde .
amphibian numbers around the world have crashed , in part because of a deadly fungus .
costa rica has been particularly badly hit .
expedition leader andrew gray , from the university of manchester 's manchester museum , said : " costa rica 's highlands used to be major biodiversity hotspots - but in many areas , amphibian populations have been completely decimated . "
killer fungus q & a : the killer fungus in the late 1980s , herpetologists around the world found that amphibian populations were suffering unprecedented declines , but they struggled to understand exactly why .
a decade later , researchers isolated a previously unknown fungus , batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which was infecting amphibians , effectively suffocating them by making it impossible for them to breathe across their skin .
recently , the scientists working on the global amphibian assessment estimated that one-third of all amphibians were threatened with extinction and about 120 species had already become extinct since the 1980s .
many believe the disease caused by the chytrid fungus is a key factor for this crash .
other causes are thought to include habitat destruction and changes in climate .
frog rediscovery countries in central america have been particularly badly affected by the deadly chytrid fungus , which is widespread there .
a great deal of effort is now being put into place to safeguard any remaining species . "
to find this species last year that was thought to be extinct at the same times as the golden toad was incredible " andrew gray andrew gray said : " for the last 10 years , i 've been working with others to ensure the future for frogs that have so far escaped extinction .
" one of the main things i have been doing is establishing breeding populations in manchester museum for a number of very , very rare species - including the splendid leaf frog -lrb- cruziohyla calcarifer -rrb- , the yellow-eyed leaf frog -lrb- agalychnas annae -rrb- and the lemur leaf frog -lrb- hylomantis lemur -rrb- .
" i 've also been working with the costa rican authorities and scientists to put conservation measures into place at the sites where any rare frogs are found . "
last year , mr gray caught a glimpse of the ithsmohyla rivularis in the cloud forests of monteverde - a frog that was thought to have gone extinct about 20 years ago .
he said : " to find this species last year that was thought to have become extinct at the same time as the golden toad was incredible - it is the rarest tree frog in the world . "
he has now been given special permission by the costa rican authorities to collect some of the frogs to take back to manchester .
he told the bbc : " we are returning to thoroughly search the site in the hope of finding more specimens .
" it 's not going to be easy - they live deep in the monteverde rainforest , they are only a couple of centimetres in size and they only come out in the dead of night - and while the males do call , the females do n't make a sound . "
' never say never ' the rediscovery of ithsmohyla rivularis has spurred the team on to also try to seek out a golden toad -lrb- bufo pereglines -rrb- .
this colourful amphibian , which scientists only discovered in 1966 , became the iconic symbol of amphibian decline .
in 1987 there were approximately 1,500 of the toads , but just two years later it had vanished from the face of the rainforest .
mr gray said : " we are going to be trekking through an area where the golden toad used to thrive .
it is very unlikely we will find one - but as last year 's discovery showed us , never say never . "
while in the rainforest , the team will also be trying to track down the miniature red-eyed tree frog -lrb- duellmanohyla uranochroa -rrb- - a species on the brink of extinction - to investigate how some frogs may be able to prevent the chytrid fungus from taking hold . "
this is a unique opportunity to study the frogs in their natural habitat " mark dickinson previous research has shown that some species of tree frog have a special pigment in their skin that enables them to reflect light , allowing them to " sunbathe " without drying out .
physicist mark dickinson , from photon science institute at the university of manchester , will be taking a spectrometer into the field to investigate how different frog species reflect light .
he said : " so far , i 've only been able to investigate captive frogs in the lab .
this is a unique opportunity to study the frogs in their natural habitat . "
the team believes that the ability to sit out in the sun may allow the frogs ' skin to heat up just enough to kill off chytrid - preventing the disease from taking its grip .
some of the team will also be heading to the last known breeding site of the green-eyed frog -lrb- lithobates vibicarius -rrb- where chester zoo is helping to support a conservation programme .
bbc news will be keeping track of the researchers ' progress over the next two weeks .

a team from manchester university and chester zoo are in costa rica to track down the highly endangered creatures .
bbc news will follow their trek deep into the cloud forests of monteverde .
amphibian numbers around the world have crashed , in part because of a deadly fungus .
costa rica has been particularly badly hit .
expedition leader andrew gray , from the university of manchester 's manchester museum , said : " costa rica 's highlands used to be major biodiversity hotspots - but in many areas , amphibian populations have been completely decimated . "
killer fungus q & a : the killer fungus in the late 1980s , herpetologists around the world found that amphibian populations were suffering unprecedented declines , but they struggled to understand exactly why .
a decade later , researchers isolated a previously unknown fungus , batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which was infecting amphibians , effectively suffocating them by making it impossible for them to breathe across their skin .
recently , the scientists working on the global amphibian assessment estimated that one-third of all amphibians were threatened with extinction and about 120 species had already become extinct since the 1980s .
many believe the disease caused by the chytrid fungus is a key factor for this crash .
other causes are thought to include habitat destruction and changes in climate .
frog rediscovery countries in central america have been particularly badly affected by the deadly chytrid fungus , which is widespread there .
a great deal of effort is now being put into place to safeguard any remaining species .
to find this species last year that was thought to be extinct at the same times as the golden toad was incredible andrew gray andrew gray said : " for the last 10 years , i 've been working with others to ensure the future for frogs that have so far escaped extinction .
" one of the main things i have been doing is establishing breeding populations in manchester museum for a number of very , very rare species - including the splendid leaf frog -lrb- cruziohyla calcarifer -rrb- , the yellow-eyed leaf frog -lrb- agalychnas annae -rrb- and the lemur leaf frog -lrb- hylomantis lemur -rrb- .
" i 've also been working with the costa rican authorities and scientists to put conservation measures into place at the sites where any rare frogs are found . "
last year , mr gray caught a glimpse of the ithsmohyla rivularis in the cloud forests of monteverde - a frog that was thought to have gone extinct about 20 years ago .
manchester museum has a splendid leaf captive breeding population he said : " to find this species last year that was thought to have become extinct at the same time as the golden toad was incredible - it is the rarest tree frog in the world . "
he has now been given special permission by the costa rican authorities to collect some of the frogs to take back to manchester .
he told the bbc : " we are returning to thoroughly search the site in the hope of finding more specimens .
" it 's not going to be easy - they live deep in the monteverde rainforest , they are only a couple of centimetres in size and they only come out in the dead of night - and while the males do call , the females do n't make a sound . "
' never say never ' the rediscovery of ithsmohyla rivularis has spurred the team on to also try to seek out a golden toad -lrb- bufo pereglines -rrb- .
this colourful amphibian , which scientists only discovered in 1966 , became the iconic symbol of amphibian decline .
in 1987 there were approximately 1,500 of the toads , but just two years later it had vanished from the face of the rainforest .
mr gray said : " we are going to be trekking through an area where the golden toad used to thrive .
it is very unlikely we will find one - but as last year 's discovery showed us , never say never . "

this is a unique opportunity to study the frogs in their natural habitat mark dickinson previous research has shown that some species of tree frog have a special pigment in their skin that enables them to reflect light , allowing them to " sunbathe " without drying out .

a team from manchester university and chester zoo are in costa rica to track down the highly endangered creatures .
bbc news will follow their trek deep into the cloud forests of monteverde .
amphibian numbers around the world have crashed , in part because of a deadly fungus .
costa rica has been particularly badly hit .
expedition leader andrew gray , from the university of manchester 's manchester museum , said : " costa rica 's highlands used to be major biodiversity hotspots - but in many areas , amphibian populations have been completely decimated . "
killer fungus q & a : the killer fungus in the late 1980s , herpetologists around the world found that amphibian populations were suffering unprecedented declines , but they struggled to understand exactly why .
a decade later , researchers isolated a previously unknown fungus , batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which was infecting amphibians , effectively suffocating them by making it impossible for them to breathe across their skin .
recently , the scientists working on the global amphibian assessment estimated that one-third of all amphibians were threatened with extinction and about 120 species had already become extinct since the 1980s .
many believe the disease caused by the chytrid fungus is a key factor for this crash .
other causes are thought to include habitat destruction and changes in climate .
frog rediscovery countries in central america have been particularly badly affected by the deadly chytrid fungus , which is widespread there .
a great deal of effort is now being put into place to safeguard any remaining species .
to find this species last year that was thought to be extinct at the same times as the golden toad was incredible andrew gray andrew gray said : " for the last 10 years , i 've been working with others to ensure the future for frogs that have so far escaped extinction .
" one of the main things i have been doing is establishing breeding populations in manchester museum for a number of very , very rare species - including the splendid leaf frog -lrb- cruziohyla calcarifer -rrb- , the yellow-eyed leaf frog -lrb- agalychnas annae -rrb- and the lemur leaf frog -lrb- hylomantis lemur -rrb- .
" i 've also been working with the costa rican authorities and scientists to put conservation measures into place at the sites where any rare frogs are found . "
last year , mr gray caught a glimpse of the ithsmohyla rivularis in the cloud forests of monteverde - a frog that was thought to have gone extinct about 20 years ago .
manchester museum has a splendid leaf captive breeding population he said : " to find this species last year that was thought to have become extinct at the same time as the golden toad was incredible - it is the rarest tree frog in the world . "
he has now been given special permission by the costa rican authorities to collect some of the frogs to take back to manchester .
he told the bbc : " we are returning to thoroughly search the site in the hope of finding more specimens .
" it 's not going to be easy - they live deep in the monteverde rainforest , they are only a couple of centimetres in size and they only come out in the dead of night - and while the males do call , the females do n't make a sound . "
' never say never ' the rediscovery of ithsmohyla rivularis has spurred the team on to also try to seek out a golden toad -lrb- bufo pereglines -rrb- .
this colourful amphibian , which scientists only discovered in 1966 , became the iconic symbol of amphibian decline .
in 1987 there were approximately 1,500 of the toads , but just two years later it had vanished from the face of the rainforest .
mr gray said : " we are going to be trekking through an area where the golden toad used to thrive .
it is very unlikely we will find one - but as last year 's discovery showed us , never say never . "

advertisement the manchester team has been looking at the properties of frogs ' skin while in the rainforest , the team will also be trying to track down the miniature red-eyed tree frog -lrb- duellmanohyla uranochroa -rrb- - a species on the brink of extinction - to investigate how some frogs may be able to prevent the chytrid fungus from taking hold .
this is a unique opportunity to study the frogs in their natural habitat mark dickinson previous research has shown that some species of tree frog have a special pigment in their skin that enables them to reflect light , allowing them to " sunbathe " without drying out .
physicist mark dickinson , from photon science institute at the university of manchester , will be taking a spectrometer into the field to investigate how different frog species reflect light .
he said : " so far , i 've only been able to investigate captive frogs in the lab .
this is a unique opportunity to study the frogs in their natural habitat . "
the team believes that the ability to sit out in the sun may allow the frogs ' skin to heat up just enough to kill off chytrid - preventing the disease from taking its grip .
some of the team will also be heading to the last known breeding site of the green-eyed frog -lrb- lithobates vibicarius -rrb- where chester zoo is helping to support a conservation programme .
bbc news will be keeping track of the researchers ' progress over the next two weeks .
