that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .

according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 02.05.2008 austria worries about tarnished image after incest case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events in the town of amstetten have rocked austria and the world fears in austria are growing about how the case of a man who locked his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her will impact the country 's image .
police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup .

there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final .

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .
" let 's not forget that the russian championship has just started and they are fit and fresh , while our team is now really on its last legs . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it gives us hope and confidence in the future when such a strong power as russia declares it will protect the people of abkhazia , " sukhumi resident lyobov shersheria , 72 , told journalists . " of course , seeing armored personnel carriers in the streets of sukhumi is not pleasant , but if there is no other way to ensure our security , what else can be done ? " she said .
" we hope there will not be war with georgia .
we already lost a whole generation of young men . " russian news agencies reported thursday that extra russian troops had begun deploying in an area near the kodori gorge , a forested mountain valley controlled at one end by the abkhaz rebels , who have close links to russia , and at the other by georgians . russia claims to counter planned georgian attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have been sent to bolster peacekeepers their deployment followed an announcement by moscow on tuesday that is was boosting its peacekeeping contingent in abkhazia in response to what it said were georgian plans to launch an assault from the kodori gorge . russia provided no details about how many extra troops were being sent to bolster its force of about 2,000 peacekeepers already deployed under accords in the early 1990s . sergei shamba , the foreign minister of abkhazia 's de facto government , told journalists wednesday that under the agreements up to 3,000 peacekeepers could be deployed in the region . he did not give a precise figure , however , for how many new russian soldiers would be arriving in abkhazia . he said the increase was necessary because " the lack of sufficient peacekeeping forces has allowed the georgian military to move freely in the upper part of the kodori gorge . " russia 's move drew strong condemnation from tbilisi , with georgia 's foreign ministry saying in a statement that it considered the troop increase an " infringement of georgia 's territorial integrity " and " interference in its internal affairs . " the european union , united states and nato also raised concern over the move . rebel region appreciates military involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops arriving in the rebel region have been welcomed but in sukhumi , which is gearing up for the start of an annual holiday season that sees thousands of russian tourists descend on its beaches , residents said they appreciated russia 's military support . " we are counting on the peacekeepers to fulfill their mandate and stand on the frontline dividing the two sides , " said one veteran of abkhazia 's separatist forces , who requested anonymity .
" but we will also be counting on ourselves if a conflict begins , " he added . the region 's abkhaz minority took control of the province in a war in the early 1990s that left thousands dead and forced more than 250,000 georgians from their homes . now home to about 200,000 people , abkhazia survives largely thanks to help from russia , which has provided passports to more than 80 percent of its residents .
but its self-declared independence has not been recognized by any country , including russia . tensions rise between tbilisi and moscow georgia 's pro-western government has repeatedly accused moscow of attempting to annex abkhazia and another rebel region , south ossetia , in order to weaken the country and stymie its efforts to join the nato military alliance . tensions between russia and georgia have soared over moscow 's decision last month to strengthen ties with the two rebel regions and over tbilisi 's claim that a russian fighter jet shot down a georgian spy drone over abkhazia on april 20 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 02.05.2008 christian festival faces allegations of discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition made its presence felt a german christian youth festival accused of discriminating against homosexuals and women has been disrupted by protests and its web site hit by hackers .
that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .
" we are living the motto of the festival : ' jesus moves you , " ' he said . anti-abortion and anti-homosexual ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister is the patron of this disputed event at the beginning of the year , christival came under fire for a planned seminar entitled " understanding homosexuality - a chance to change " .
according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 02.05.2008 barroso : emissions limits a blessing for german car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cars need to get cleaner before they meet eu guidelines the eu is stepping up pressure on german carmakers to decrease greenhouse gases with new vehicles that have more efficient engines , amid industry concerns about the sacrifices expected to tackle climate change . there is no better way to reduce global carbon emissions than producing more energy efficient automobiles , eu commission president jose manuel barroso told the daily augsburger allgemeine on friday , may 2 . " german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .

the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .
" we are living the motto of the festival : ' jesus moves you , " ' he said . anti-abortion and anti-homosexual ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister is the patron of this disputed event at the beginning of the year , christival came under fire for a planned seminar entitled " understanding homosexuality - a chance to change " .
according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 02.05.2008 barroso : emissions limits a blessing for german car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cars need to get cleaner before they meet eu guidelines the eu is stepping up pressure on german carmakers to decrease greenhouse gases with new vehicles that have more efficient engines , amid industry concerns about the sacrifices expected to tackle climate change . there is no better way to reduce global carbon emissions than producing more energy efficient automobiles , eu commission president jose manuel barroso told the daily augsburger allgemeine on friday , may 2 . " german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

" iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 .

us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

" it gives us hope and confidence in the future when such a strong power as russia declares it will protect the people of abkhazia , " sukhumi resident lyobov shersheria , 72 , told journalists . " of course , seeing armored personnel carriers in the streets of sukhumi is not pleasant , but if there is no other way to ensure our security , what else can be done ? " she said .
" we hope there will not be war with georgia .
we already lost a whole generation of young men . " russian news agencies reported thursday that extra russian troops had begun deploying in an area near the kodori gorge , a forested mountain valley controlled at one end by the abkhaz rebels , who have close links to russia , and at the other by georgians . russia claims to counter planned georgian attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have been sent to bolster peacekeepers their deployment followed an announcement by moscow on tuesday that is was boosting its peacekeeping contingent in abkhazia in response to what it said were georgian plans to launch an assault from the kodori gorge . russia provided no details about how many extra troops were being sent to bolster its force of about 2,000 peacekeepers already deployed under accords in the early 1990s . sergei shamba , the foreign minister of abkhazia 's de facto government , told journalists wednesday that under the agreements up to 3,000 peacekeepers could be deployed in the region . he did not give a precise figure , however , for how many new russian soldiers would be arriving in abkhazia . he said the increase was necessary because " the lack of sufficient peacekeeping forces has allowed the georgian military to move freely in the upper part of the kodori gorge . " russia 's move drew strong condemnation from tbilisi , with georgia 's foreign ministry saying in a statement that it considered the troop increase an " infringement of georgia 's territorial integrity " and " interference in its internal affairs . " the european union , united states and nato also raised concern over the move . rebel region appreciates military involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops arriving in the rebel region have been welcomed but in sukhumi , which is gearing up for the start of an annual holiday season that sees thousands of russian tourists descend on its beaches , residents said they appreciated russia 's military support . " we are counting on the peacekeepers to fulfill their mandate and stand on the frontline dividing the two sides , " said one veteran of abkhazia 's separatist forces , who requested anonymity .
" but we will also be counting on ourselves if a conflict begins , " he added . the region 's abkhaz minority took control of the province in a war in the early 1990s that left thousands dead and forced more than 250,000 georgians from their homes . now home to about 200,000 people , abkhazia survives largely thanks to help from russia , which has provided passports to more than 80 percent of its residents .
but its self-declared independence has not been recognized by any country , including russia . tensions rise between tbilisi and moscow georgia 's pro-western government has repeatedly accused moscow of attempting to annex abkhazia and another rebel region , south ossetia , in order to weaken the country and stymie its efforts to join the nato military alliance . tensions between russia and georgia have soared over moscow 's decision last month to strengthen ties with the two rebel regions and over tbilisi 's claim that a russian fighter jet shot down a georgian spy drone over abkhazia on april 20 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 .

that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment .

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it gives us hope and confidence in the future when such a strong power as russia declares it will protect the people of abkhazia , " sukhumi resident lyobov shersheria , 72 , told journalists . " of course , seeing armored personnel carriers in the streets of sukhumi is not pleasant , but if there is no other way to ensure our security , what else can be done ? " she said .
" we hope there will not be war with georgia .
we already lost a whole generation of young men . " russian news agencies reported thursday that extra russian troops had begun deploying in an area near the kodori gorge , a forested mountain valley controlled at one end by the abkhaz rebels , who have close links to russia , and at the other by georgians . russia claims to counter planned georgian attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have been sent to bolster peacekeepers their deployment followed an announcement by moscow on tuesday that is was boosting its peacekeeping contingent in abkhazia in response to what it said were georgian plans to launch an assault from the kodori gorge . russia provided no details about how many extra troops were being sent to bolster its force of about 2,000 peacekeepers already deployed under accords in the early 1990s . sergei shamba , the foreign minister of abkhazia 's de facto government , told journalists wednesday that under the agreements up to 3,000 peacekeepers could be deployed in the region . he did not give a precise figure , however , for how many new russian soldiers would be arriving in abkhazia . he said the increase was necessary because " the lack of sufficient peacekeeping forces has allowed the georgian military to move freely in the upper part of the kodori gorge . " russia 's move drew strong condemnation from tbilisi , with georgia 's foreign ministry saying in a statement that it considered the troop increase an " infringement of georgia 's territorial integrity " and " interference in its internal affairs . " the european union , united states and nato also raised concern over the move . rebel region appreciates military involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops arriving in the rebel region have been welcomed but in sukhumi , which is gearing up for the start of an annual holiday season that sees thousands of russian tourists descend on its beaches , residents said they appreciated russia 's military support . " we are counting on the peacekeepers to fulfill their mandate and stand on the frontline dividing the two sides , " said one veteran of abkhazia 's separatist forces , who requested anonymity .
" but we will also be counting on ourselves if a conflict begins , " he added . the region 's abkhaz minority took control of the province in a war in the early 1990s that left thousands dead and forced more than 250,000 georgians from their homes . now home to about 200,000 people , abkhazia survives largely thanks to help from russia , which has provided passports to more than 80 percent of its residents .
but its self-declared independence has not been recognized by any country , including russia . tensions rise between tbilisi and moscow georgia 's pro-western government has repeatedly accused moscow of attempting to annex abkhazia and another rebel region , south ossetia , in order to weaken the country and stymie its efforts to join the nato military alliance . tensions between russia and georgia have soared over moscow 's decision last month to strengthen ties with the two rebel regions and over tbilisi 's claim that a russian fighter jet shot down a georgian spy drone over abkhazia on april 20 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .
" we are living the motto of the festival : ' jesus moves you , " ' he said . anti-abortion and anti-homosexual ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister is the patron of this disputed event at the beginning of the year , christival came under fire for a planned seminar entitled " understanding homosexuality - a chance to change " .
according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state .

" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going .

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .
" we are living the motto of the festival : ' jesus moves you , " ' he said . anti-abortion and anti-homosexual ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister is the patron of this disputed event at the beginning of the year , christival came under fire for a planned seminar entitled " understanding homosexuality - a chance to change " .
according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup .

there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

" any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .
" let 's not forget that the russian championship has just started and they are fit and fresh , while our team is now really on its last legs . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .

according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup .

there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .

" it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .
" we are living the motto of the festival : ' jesus moves you , " ' he said . anti-abortion and anti-homosexual ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister is the patron of this disputed event at the beginning of the year , christival came under fire for a planned seminar entitled " understanding homosexuality - a chance to change " .
according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .

the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup .

" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .
" let 's not forget that the russian championship has just started and they are fit and fresh , while our team is now really on its last legs . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 .

us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility .

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .

hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .

werner said it was his decision .

but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions . " for germany , the car industry is a symbol of its economic miracle , " he said .
" but the commission 's proposals are never meant as wars against a particular member state . " the biofuel backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for biofuels has contributed to the food crisis as debate rages on about biofuels - which some experts now believe do more environmental damage than the co2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels and have contributed to the worldwide rise on food prices - barroso told the newspaper that the commission would not be rethinking its current policies of pushing biofuel as an additive to conventional fuels . the food crisis has " numerous structural and economic causes , " he said .
" it is not realistic to pin all the blame on biofuels , especially in europe . " i see no reason to suspend the european union 's goal of having 10 percent of transportation fuel made from biofuel by 2020 , " he added , pointing out that only 2 percent of eu grain production is used for biofuels . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german manufacturers are uniquely well-prepared to meet these new challenges , " he said , adding that in years to come car manufacturers " will thank the commission for introducing new legislation because it will be a blessing for everyone in terms of global competitiveness . " but for the time being , much of the european car industry has its doubts - with germany in particular balking at the eu 's ambitious emission targets . car industry complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are responsible for about half of transport-related co2 emissions in 2007 , the european commission said it wanted the average new car made in the eu to emit no more than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2012 .
across the bloc , transport co2 emissions grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
the share of co2 emissions created by transport was 21 percent in 1990 , but had grown to 27 percent by 2005 . emissions from passenger cars are responsible for approximately half of this - and all these figures would come down considerably if cars were made more fuel efficient . the car industry , however , insists it should not be only up to carmakers to achieve the reductions , arguing that some of the burden should fall on tire technology , new taxation policies , alternative fuels , reducing congestion and the car-driving general public . not just germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says that brussels is not campaigning against germany in particular earlier this year , barroso brushed aside the german car industry 's concerns . " i am very optimistic about the future of the german car industry , " he said at a meeting with the state of lower saxony 's premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democrats , in march .
" given that germany is a world leader in terms of technology and innovation , its car industry is set to benefit from the eu 's new regulations , which moreover apply to every other country , too . " it is difficult to have the support of both porsche and greenpeace , " said barroso in response to wulff 's fears that german industry would lose out under the eu 's plan . in contrast to carmakers in other eu countries , such as france , german carmakers , such as bmw , daimler , audi and volkswagen , are still a long way from manufacturing " clean " cars .
but to achieve the target of changing europe 's energy mix to an overall 20 percent from renewable sources as planned , the onus is on germany to pull its weight . german carmakers produce some of europe 's largest and heaviest vehicles , which industry officials have said put them at a disadvantage when compared to other european automakers . barroso told the augsburger allgemeine that he was not surprised by the german skepticism about overhauling its car-making traditions .

" i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.

police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

former army officer philipp freiherr von boeselager provided the explosives for the unsuccessful attack on the german leader . the bomb exploded but the nazi leader escaped with slight injuries because an officer had moved the briefcase containing the explosives behind a sturdy leg of an oak table . von boeselager was not executed unlike most of the other officers directly involved in the attempted assassination in 1944 because his co-conspirators refused to reveal his identity . von boeselager advocate of cruise film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von boeselager was one of the few defenders of the film about the 20 july plot this chapter of german history is currently being turned into a movie with tom cruise playing claus schenk von stauffenberg , the plotter who planted the bomb . von boeselager , who died early on thursday morning -lrb- may 1 -rrb- , had welcomed the film , which has been controversial because of the involvement of the scientologist cruise , saying that it could help the americans to understand more about the german resistance . the former army officer had also been selected to assassinate hitler in an earlier plot , but the plan - which was due to be executed on 13 march 1943 - was cancelled , when it became clear that heinrich himmler , whom the plotters also wanted to kill , would not be accompanying the german leader .
he always expressed regret for not having gone ahead when he had the opportunity . von boeselager , whose brother georg was also involved in the resistance , always cited the holocaust as his motive for wanting to assassinate hitler .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily in one of his last interviews that he could not have slept if he had refused to take part . he said that he first heard of the nazi killings during his time at the russian front in june 1942 - in this particular case the murder of sinti and roma . until shortly before his death , the former army officer had given talks and lectures in schools and other venues across germany about national socialism and the resistance organized by von stauffenberg and henning von tresckow . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 02.05.2008 austria worries about tarnished image after incest case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events in the town of amstetten have rocked austria and the world fears in austria are growing about how the case of a man who locked his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her will impact the country 's image .
police plan to revisit missing person cases . several hundred journalists from all over the world are currently camped out in amstetten , the town in eastern austria where 73-year-old josef f. perpetrated his crimes . austria 's tourist industry is worried about the fall-out from the case .
many international commentators have interpreted it as a sign of something being rotten in the state of austria - that the case is a reflection of the state of the national psyche . the nightmare scenario is that the country of mountains and lakes , of mozart , haydn and the habsburg monarchy , will now be seen as " the land of dungeons , " as one foreign newspaper has called it . history repeating itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the basement where f. incarcerated his daughter for almost 25 years part of the problem is that the case is not the first of its kind .
in august 2006 , 20-year-old natascha kampusch escaped her kidnapper after spending eight years locked up in a basement dungeon . and there were others : a mother who locked her daughters in the house for years , and , in the 1990s , the case of maria , a girl who was kept in a wooden box by her parents . the press response has been harsh .
italy 's la stampa said perversion and serial killers are " naturally not exclusively austrian but there they are tied up with waltzes , yodelers and cuckoo clocks . "
the paper wondered whether f. 's crimes were " uniquely austrian . " poland 's dziennik newspaper asked : " why are such beasts born in austria ? "
while the swiss tagesanzeiger looked for causes in the conservative , agricultural and " arch-catholic " society of lower austria where " words such as civil society and self-responsibility are still alien . " in germany , a number of newspapers have drawn a parallel between the subterranean nature of these crimes and the country 's tendency towards repression .
for years , austria depicted itself as the victim of the nazi regime rather than a complicit accessory . some circles inside austria share this opinion .
according to austrian writer josef haslinger , his country has a " fatal tradition " of " brushing things under the carpet . "
he told german radio that austrians should not act as if the amstetten incest case " has nothing to do with austria , as if it could happen anywhere . " heads of state defend country 's honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f. 's daughter is currently being cared for in a clinic state representatives beg to differ .
the vehement criticism of austria has prompted an official response from the highest quarters .
austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said in vienna on thursday , may 1 , that citizens should not allow " the whole of austria to be taken hostage by a single criminal , cruel perpetrator ... we have the reputation of our country to defend . " a day before , austrian president heinz fischer also spoke up on behalf of the nation , saying in an interview that " there is nothing subtly austrian about this case .
the monstrousness that man is capable of can be revealed anywhere . "
this can be proven , he said , by looking at the " worldwide horror headlines of recent years . " austria 's leaders will be relieved to hear that some analysts believe the damage to the country 's image will not be permanent . market researcher wolfgang bachmayer told the dpa news agency that the qualities normally associated with austria - tradition and coziness - would eventually be restored in the public mind , while another market researcher , karin cwritila , said the alpine country would win back its classic image as an " island of the blessed .

the russians will meet glasgow rangers in the final in manchester on may 21 . the defeat on thursday , may 1 , in petrovsky stadium crushed bayern 's hopes of scooping a hat-trick this season .
the club has already raised the german cup and is firmly on course to win the german league title . zenit , who also kicked bundesliga side bayer leverkusen out of european competition , looked the stronger side throughout the match . their attacking display against the former four-time european champions even impressed bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , who tipped to win the cup . " any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .

the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .

the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .

the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .

" any team that beats bayern 4-0 must be the favorites , " he said . historic defeat for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black and white case : zenit looked superior throughout the game bayern were last beaten 4-0 in european competition 31 years ago when they lost to eintracht frankfurt in the last 16 of the uefa cup .
there was a similar heavy defeat in the 1991/92 competition when they were beaten 6-2 by b1903 copehnagen in a second-round uefa cup tie . the home side got off to a shaky start when roman shirokov had to clear off the line from miroslav klose in the second minute , but two minutes later the russians found themselves in front . after a foul by lucio outside the area , pavel pogrebnyak hammered home the ball with his left foot , wrong footing oliver kahn in goal . in the 39th minute , konstanin zyrianov made it 2-0 to the russian side .
viktor fayzulin all but ended bayern 's hopes with a header in the 54th to make it 3-0 . the goalkeeper was again left standing in the 73rd when dominguez skipped past philipp lahm on the right and found pogrebynak who side-footed the ball into the net from just inside the area to notch up his second goal of the match . " it was a catastrophic performance , " said hitzfeld , who is moving to coach the swiss national side next season .
" we really had the stuffing knocked out of us . " the defeat was also a sorry european farewell for 38-year-old goalkeeper oliver kahn who is retiring at the end of the season .
he , however , put a brave face on it . " it 's better to get knocked out like that rather than on penalties , or in a close game , " he said . it is the first time zenit , coached by dutchman dick advocaat , have reached a major european final . " it was unbelievable how we played , " advocaat said .
" the most important thing is that we did n't give them much room .
we had a lot of respect for bayern .
they are a very good team but today was our day . " bayern munich cite exhaustion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a sad match for oliver kahn , who said , " sometimes you just want it to end . "
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the players were " disappointed , " but could end the season with their heads held high after " winning two titles " - the german cup and almost certainly the bundesliga . " we have to recognize that zenit played a super game , " he said .

also on friday , may 2 , the mid-east quartet urged arab states to help palestinians and israel to halt settlements . six key world powers agreed friday to make a new offer to iran over its disputed nuclear program , british foreign secretary david miliband said after talks friday . " i am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of iran , " miliband said , after discussions with his counterparts from the united states , germany , france , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , iran has insisted on continuing its nuclear program in a brief statement , miliband added that the powers had " reviewed and updated " an offer made to iran in june 2006 , but that the contents of the new proposal would only be disclosed to iran . " we will be transmitting that offer , we wo n't be revealing details except to the government of iran and we very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the severity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions we are making . " he said the proposal was designed to show tehran " the benefits of cooperating with the international community . " iran insists that its nuclear program is meant purely for civilian use although many in the west fear tehran 's goal is to develop nuclear weapons . keeping promises urging both israelis and palestinians to make " every effort " to reach agreement on a palestinian state by the end of this year , the four powers called on donor states to come good on promises to the palestinians made at a paris conference in december 2007 . " the quartet -lsb- the un , the us , the eu and russia -rsb- encouraged the arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the annapolis process , " read the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good fences make good neighbors ?
us sources have alleged that so far , approximately one fifth of the funds promised by arab league members last year have been paid . the quartet mediating in the middle east peace process also called on israel to freeze the construction of further settlements in the west bank , and voiced concern over the gaza strip due to an israeli blockade preventing essential services to get through . " israel should freeze all settlement activity including natural growth , and dismantle outposts erected since march 2001 , " they said , in the statement quoted by un chief ban ki-moon at a news conference . " the quartet called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to gaza without obstruction , " the statement added . humanitarian crisis shortages of fuel and basic goods have been undermining the gaza strip 's economy since israeli restrictions were imposed after hamas took control in june 2007 . former british prime minister tony blair , who now heads the quartet as its international envoy , described the situation in gaza as " terrible . " in the run-up to the london talks , aid agencies had urged the quartet to use the meeting to press israel to end its blockade of gaza , and to " to end its complacency by putting the highest diplomatic pressure on the israeli government to lift the blockade on gaza . " warning of " an impending humanitarian crisis , " they added that the israeli stranglehold on the sliver of land " has made life for ordinary people intolerable " and made it near impossible for aid agencies to work there . breakthrough coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with israeli defense minister ehud barak speaking in london , blair said he believed a breakthrough in palestinian and israeli relations was real possibility . " the reason why i remain … .not merely determined but also believe that we can achieve a breakthrough is that there is a focus now both on improving the palestinian security capability and on getting economic and social development going . " despite the " difficult situation " in gaza it should be possible to end the current deadlock , he maintained . " there is a different and better way through .
that is for the terror attacks and the rocket attacks and the smuggling of weapons to stop , for the action therefore by israel also to stop and for a progressive lifting of the restrictions and the opening of the border , " said blair . us secretary of state condoleezza rice echoed the sentiment . " it is hard work , it is labor intensive and it is time consuming , but i believe they do have a chance to get an agreement by the end of the year , but that is what we are going to work for every day , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it gives us hope and confidence in the future when such a strong power as russia declares it will protect the people of abkhazia , " sukhumi resident lyobov shersheria , 72 , told journalists . " of course , seeing armored personnel carriers in the streets of sukhumi is not pleasant , but if there is no other way to ensure our security , what else can be done ? " she said .
" we hope there will not be war with georgia .
we already lost a whole generation of young men . " russian news agencies reported thursday that extra russian troops had begun deploying in an area near the kodori gorge , a forested mountain valley controlled at one end by the abkhaz rebels , who have close links to russia , and at the other by georgians . russia claims to counter planned georgian attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have been sent to bolster peacekeepers their deployment followed an announcement by moscow on tuesday that is was boosting its peacekeeping contingent in abkhazia in response to what it said were georgian plans to launch an assault from the kodori gorge . russia provided no details about how many extra troops were being sent to bolster its force of about 2,000 peacekeepers already deployed under accords in the early 1990s . sergei shamba , the foreign minister of abkhazia 's de facto government , told journalists wednesday that under the agreements up to 3,000 peacekeepers could be deployed in the region . he did not give a precise figure , however , for how many new russian soldiers would be arriving in abkhazia . he said the increase was necessary because " the lack of sufficient peacekeeping forces has allowed the georgian military to move freely in the upper part of the kodori gorge . " russia 's move drew strong condemnation from tbilisi , with georgia 's foreign ministry saying in a statement that it considered the troop increase an " infringement of georgia 's territorial integrity " and " interference in its internal affairs . " the european union , united states and nato also raised concern over the move . rebel region appreciates military involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops arriving in the rebel region have been welcomed but in sukhumi , which is gearing up for the start of an annual holiday season that sees thousands of russian tourists descend on its beaches , residents said they appreciated russia 's military support . " we are counting on the peacekeepers to fulfill their mandate and stand on the frontline dividing the two sides , " said one veteran of abkhazia 's separatist forces , who requested anonymity .
" but we will also be counting on ourselves if a conflict begins , " he added . the region 's abkhaz minority took control of the province in a war in the early 1990s that left thousands dead and forced more than 250,000 georgians from their homes . now home to about 200,000 people , abkhazia survives largely thanks to help from russia , which has provided passports to more than 80 percent of its residents .
but its self-declared independence has not been recognized by any country , including russia . tensions rise between tbilisi and moscow georgia 's pro-western government has repeatedly accused moscow of attempting to annex abkhazia and another rebel region , south ossetia , in order to weaken the country and stymie its efforts to join the nato military alliance . tensions between russia and georgia have soared over moscow 's decision last month to strengthen ties with the two rebel regions and over tbilisi 's claim that a russian fighter jet shot down a georgian spy drone over abkhazia on april 20 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russian news agencies reported thursday that extra russian troops had begun deploying in an area near the kodori gorge , a forested mountain valley controlled at one end by the abkhaz rebels , who have close links to russia , and at the other by georgians . russia claims to counter planned georgian attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have been sent to bolster peacekeepers their deployment followed an announcement by moscow on tuesday that is was boosting its peacekeeping contingent in abkhazia in response to what it said were georgian plans to launch an assault from the kodori gorge . russia provided no details about how many extra troops were being sent to bolster its force of about 2,000 peacekeepers already deployed under accords in the early 1990s . sergei shamba , the foreign minister of abkhazia 's de facto government , told journalists wednesday that under the agreements up to 3,000 peacekeepers could be deployed in the region . he did not give a precise figure , however , for how many new russian soldiers would be arriving in abkhazia . he said the increase was necessary because " the lack of sufficient peacekeeping forces has allowed the georgian military to move freely in the upper part of the kodori gorge . " russia 's move drew strong condemnation from tbilisi , with georgia 's foreign ministry saying in a statement that it considered the troop increase an " infringement of georgia 's territorial integrity " and " interference in its internal affairs . " the european union , united states and nato also raised concern over the move . rebel region appreciates military involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops arriving in the rebel region have been welcomed but in sukhumi , which is gearing up for the start of an annual holiday season that sees thousands of russian tourists descend on its beaches , residents said they appreciated russia 's military support . " we are counting on the peacekeepers to fulfill their mandate and stand on the frontline dividing the two sides , " said one veteran of abkhazia 's separatist forces , who requested anonymity .
" but we will also be counting on ourselves if a conflict begins , " he added . the region 's abkhaz minority took control of the province in a war in the early 1990s that left thousands dead and forced more than 250,000 georgians from their homes . now home to about 200,000 people , abkhazia survives largely thanks to help from russia , which has provided passports to more than 80 percent of its residents .
but its self-declared independence has not been recognized by any country , including russia . tensions rise between tbilisi and moscow georgia 's pro-western government has repeatedly accused moscow of attempting to annex abkhazia and another rebel region , south ossetia , in order to weaken the country and stymie its efforts to join the nato military alliance . tensions between russia and georgia have soared over moscow 's decision last month to strengthen ties with the two rebel regions and over tbilisi 's claim that a russian fighter jet shot down a georgian spy drone over abkhazia on april 20 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that it received money from the german government has some angry . it is being described by its organizers as a " belief party , " and " the christian event of the year . "
the " christival , " which runs until sunday , has brought some 16,000 people between 16 and 26 from across germany to the city of bremen .
but while germany 's other big church get-togethers - the protestants and catholics hold them regularly - are mostly feel-good events with singing and praying accompanied by a fair amount of media coverage , the christival event this year kicked off with a very different tenor and got some press it did n't anticipate .
during the opening on wednesday -lrb- apr .
30 -rrb- , some 100 masked demonstrators hurled molotov cocktails and attempted to storm the stage .
hundreds of others took part in a protest march .
the event 's internet site was also forced offline for a while because of hacker attacks .
the protests were sparked by planned seminars over homosexuality and abortion which were critical of both .
while the seminars ' stances were in line with the conservative line of the festival organizers , it did not , according to many protesters , fit in with modern german society .
christival chairman roland werner said he was saddened by the disruptive acts .
but , halfway through the event , he said the event had been positive over all .
" we are living the motto of the festival : ' jesus moves you , " ' he said . anti-abortion and anti-homosexual ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister is the patron of this disputed event at the beginning of the year , christival came under fire for a planned seminar entitled " understanding homosexuality - a chance to change " .
according to jesus.de , werner " used to believe he was homosexual , " but was now " happily married to his wife . "
the seminar never took place .
deputy family minister hermann kues said it was cancelled on the prompting of the ministry .
werner said it was his decision .
the controversy had made it impossible to hold a proper discussion , according to the christival chairman . gay green parliamentarian volker beck had brought up issue for discussion in the bundestag because of the german family ministry 's links to the event .
the event in bremen has received 250,000 euros in public funding and family minister ursula von der leyen is its patron .
a seminar planned for saturday -lrb- may 3 -rrb- is continuing to stir up anger .
the event - called " sex is god 's idea - abortion , too ? " - is being staged by pro-life group " die birke , " which rejects abortion even in the case of rape .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , defended the festival from the criticism .
he said on friday , may 2 , one should not " reduce christival to the two topics of homosexuality and conflicts over pregnancy . "
on friday evening , he will take communion with the festival 's participants . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

clocking up labour 's lowest share of the vote since the late 1960s has turned what were always going to be a difficult set of mid-term elections into a serious problem for the prime minister , and set the tone for the politics of the coming months .
in 2004 , the last time this set of council seats were up for grabs , the party could attribute its paltry 26 % of the vote on iraq and the unpopularity of then prime minister tony blair .
this time , things are 2 % worse and the blame can not be pinned on either the war or mr blair .

mr brown will be pinning his hopes on a labour victory in london right now , love is not all gordon brown needs .
clocking up labour 's lowest share of the vote since the late 1960s has turned what were always going to be a difficult set of mid-term elections into a serious problem for the prime minister , and set the tone for the politics of the coming months .
in 2004 , the last time this set of council seats were up for grabs , the party could attribute its paltry 26 % of the vote on iraq and the unpopularity of then prime minister tony blair .
this time , things are 2 % worse and the blame can not be pinned on either the war or mr blair .
local elections are always tricky for governments , especially ones which have been around for more than a decade , but this was bad .
tory joy treat this statistic with a slight pinch of salt - general elections are very different from council elections - but if this result were to be repeated next time the country goes to the polls , labour would be left with 169 mps and the tories would have a majority of 138 .
taking london may ultimately turn out to be a bit like your football team winning the local derby - makes you feel brilliant for a week or two but does not necessarily mean you 're going to win the league for the tories , there was much to savour in this set of results .
taking control of a council like bury means they can claim a revival of their fortunes in northern england .
seizing southampton was a bonus - but one which will make john denham , the innovation and skills secretary and mp for southampton itchen , a worried man .
they increased their share of the vote and with it , david cameron 's claim to be a prime minister-in-waiting .
for the libdems , a curate 's egg of an evening .
london result on the one hand they gained councils like hull and st albans , but on the other , their projected share of the national vote was 25 % - one per cent less than former leader sir menzies campbell .
not a statistic likely to be enjoyed by successor , nick clegg , in his first election outing as party leader .
then there 's london .
by the time you read this , the capital may have a new mayor - the city has already voted and made its decision .
thing is , we wo n't know what that decision is until this evening , as the votes are n't being counted until later on friday .
local derby seizing london would be the icing on the cake for the tories .
the fab four were in the charts last time labour did this badly they could justifiably claim that victory in such a diverse and multicultural city shows that people are ready to vote conservative again .
for labour , holding it would be a crumb of comfort from a pretty unpalatable evening .
but in a way , important as it is , taking london may ultimately turn out to be a bit like your football team winning the local derby - makes you feel brilliant for a week or two but does not necessarily mean you 're going to win the league .
whatever happens between ken , boris and brian , a general election could be as much as two years away and if a week is a long time in politics , that is an eternity .
plenty of time for things to turn round - or get worse .
thursday 's results do not necessarily mean the knives are out for gordon brown but unless he does something that shows he is a man with a plan - that he is a winner - that whirring noise you can hear in the background may well be the sound of blades being sharpened by his worried mps .

clocking up labour 's lowest share of the vote since the late 1960s has turned what were always going to be a difficult set of mid-term elections into a serious problem for the prime minister , and set the tone for the politics of the coming months .
in 2004 , the last time this set of council seats were up for grabs , the party could attribute its paltry 26 % of the vote on iraq and the unpopularity of then prime minister tony blair .

writing for the bbc scotland news website , first minister and snp leader alex salmond reflects on the last 12 months .
almost one year ago we said it was time for scotland to move forward .
the people of scotland agreed and they entrusted us with government .
mr salmond said scotland could rise to any challenge we are repaying the trust of the people of scotland by breathing new life into scottish democracy , and delivering for our great public services .
we are determined to show scotland is using its responsibilities wisely - and together we are capable of much more .
we know we have faced some substantial challenges - as is clear from the grangemouth industrial action .
others have been the glasgow airport attack and the serious implications for rural scotland of the foot-and-mouth outbreak south of the border .
however , all nations face problems - the issue is how we cope with them , and stay focused on the key task of building a prosperous economy and rich society .
if we work together and act together , scotland can rise to any challenge .
the scottish government trusts the people - and their right to choose our nation 's future in april , some of our key measures took effect - including freezing council tax to deliver relief for hard pressed households , cutting business rates to boost the economy and jobs , abolishing prescription charges to end the tax on ill health in this 60th anniversary year of the nhs and scrapping the graduate endowment to restore free education in scotland based on the ability to learn rather than to pay .
we have also saved vital accident and emergency units at ayr and monklands , abolished the tolls on the forth and tay bridges , launched the national conversation on scotland 's constitutional future , and are funding 1,000 more police officers in scotland 's communities .
and we will continue to build on our record of delivery for the people of scotland - increasing the natural and competitive advantages that our nation is blessed with .
as the snp delivers good government in devolved areas , and secures the trust of the people , we will build the case for scotland to be governed equally well in all areas .
while we are certainly not immune from global financial problems , i believe that we have the skills , resources and opportunities to thrive and prosper .
scotland has a bright future as an independent nation .
the key democratic issue is the people 's right to choose that future in a referendum .
the scottish government trusts the people - and their right to choose our nation 's future .
that is a key reason why i believe the people trust the snp in government as we mark our first year in office .

it was a very different day to the euphoria the two of them felt five months earlier when , as newlyweds , they travelled to wembley from their home in portsmouth to see their football team bring home the fa cup trophy .
" it was a lovely day - a day i shall never forget , " mrs gauntlett says , smiling .
now 88 years old , she remembers the 29 april 1939 as if it was yesterday .
" i was wearing a blue dress and a blue and white scarf , " she says .
she also remembers being given a box to stand on to get a better view and her husband had a cracker he spun in his hand while they cheered pompey on .
" everyone was going : ' come on the blues , come on the blues ! ' , " mrs gauntlett recalls .
in the build up to the fa cup final that year , wolverhampton wanderers , who were lying second in the league table , were the favourite to win .
but pompey , who were facing relegation at the time , pulled out all the stops to win 4-1 .
" i was hoarse , my voice had gone , " mrs gauntlett says laughing while describing the all-night-long celebration that followed .
" there was no trouble - just singing and dancing . "
after the game finished many pompey supporters , including mr and mrs gauntlett , gathered in the elephant and castle public house , where they celebrated until the early hours .
they even nearly missed the last train home from london .
" this landlord said : ' you all pompey supporters , you 've got to get the train , the last train is the milk train .
if you want to get home you 've got to go ! ' .
" we were all going to waterloo station singing and dancing . "
when they arrived in portsmouth in the early hours people were still out in the streets celebrating .
but mr gauntlett , who worked for a wholesale newsagent , had to take his wife home and then go straight to work .
" i went straight to bed of course , " mrs gauntlett says .
by september that year , war had broken out and mr gauntlett was sent to france , where he ended up on the beaches of dunkirk .
he survived the battle by swimming to a rescue boat and ended up in hospital in aldershot .
but at home in portsmouth , mrs gauntlett had received a letter saying her husband was missing in action .
she thought he had been killed .
until he turned up again in portsmouth .
" he pinched a sergeant 's uniform cause he 'd had enough and walked out , " mrs gauntlett says as she describes how he sneaked out of hospital and returned home .
but he was soon sent back to france , where he " was lucky " to end up as a cook at a chateau used by the allied forces instead of at the frontline .
mr gauntlett , who remained a pompey supporter all his life , died in 1997 .
no ticket their son gordon jnr inherited his parents love for the football club .
he was one of the brains behind portsmouth fc 's sos campaign in the 1970s - an action group trying to raise about £ 100,000 to get the club out of debt - and later became one of the directors of the club .
" we used to go every saturday they were playing at home .
i could n't go to the away games because i had young children at home . "
and despite being nearly 90 , mrs gauntlett remains a faithful pompey supporter and follows every game they play , either on tv or the radio .
she says it would be her dream to be able to return to wembley for pompey 's the fa cup final on 17 may against cardiff city , pompey 's first since the 1939 win .
but because the 25,000 tickets available for pompey supporters were reserved for club members and season ticket holders , mrs gauntlett has been unable to get a ticket .
" i 've never heard of anyone who goes to football at 88 , " she says .
" but when i was asked if i would go , i said : ' of course i would go ' .
" but i ca n't get a ticket . "

it was a very different day to the euphoria the two of them felt five months earlier when , as newlyweds , they travelled to wembley from their home in portsmouth to see their football team bring home the fa cup trophy .
" it was a lovely day - a day i shall never forget , " mrs gauntlett says , smiling .
now 88 years old , she remembers the 29 april 1939 as if it was yesterday .
" i was wearing a blue dress and a blue and white scarf , " she says .
she also remembers being given a box to stand on to get a better view and her husband had a cracker he spun in his hand while they cheered pompey on .
" everyone was going : ' come on the blues , come on the blues ! ' , " mrs gauntlett recalls .
in the build up to the fa cup final that year , wolverhampton wanderers , who were lying second in the league table , were the favourite to win .
gordon gauntlett left portsmouth to fight in wwii in september 1939 enlarge image but pompey , who were facing relegation at the time , pulled out all the stops to win 4-1 .
" i was hoarse , my voice had gone , " mrs gauntlett says laughing while describing the all-night-long celebration that followed .
" there was no trouble - just singing and dancing . "
after the game finished many pompey supporters , including mr and mrs gauntlett , gathered in the elephant and castle public house , where they celebrated until the early hours .
they even nearly missed the last train home from london .
" this landlord said : ' you all pompey supporters , you 've got to get the train , the last train is the milk train .
if you want to get home you 've got to go ! ' .
" we were all going to waterloo station singing and dancing . "
when they arrived in portsmouth in the early hours people were still out in the streets celebrating .
but mr gauntlett , who worked for a wholesale newsagent , had to take his wife home and then go straight to work .
mrs gauntlett has passed on her passion for pompey to her family " i went straight to bed of course , " mrs gauntlett says .
by september that year , war had broken out and mr gauntlett was sent to france , where he ended up on the beaches of dunkirk .
he survived the battle by swimming to a rescue boat and ended up in hospital in aldershot .
but at home in portsmouth , mrs gauntlett had received a letter saying her husband was missing in action .
she thought he had been killed .
until he turned up again in portsmouth .
" he pinched a sergeant 's uniform cause he 'd had enough and walked out , " mrs gauntlett says as she describes how he sneaked out of hospital and returned home .
but he was soon sent back to france , where he " was lucky " to end up as a cook at a chateau used by the allied forces instead of at the frontline .
mr gauntlett , who remained a pompey supporter all his life , died in 1997 .
no ticket their son gordon jnr inherited his parents love for the football club .
he was one of the brains behind portsmouth fc 's sos campaign in the 1970s - an action group trying to raise about £ 100,000 to get the club out of debt - and later became one of the directors of the club .
" we used to go every saturday they were playing at home .
i could n't go to the away games because i had young children at home . "
and despite being nearly 90 , mrs gauntlett remains a faithful pompey supporter and follows every game they play , either on tv or the radio .
she says it would be her dream to be able to return to wembley for pompey 's the fa cup final on 17 may against cardiff city , pompey 's first since the 1939 win .
but because the 25,000 tickets available for pompey supporters were reserved for club members and season ticket holders , mrs gauntlett has been unable to get a ticket .
" i 've never heard of anyone who goes to football at 88 , " she says .
" but when i was asked if i would go , i said : ' of course i would go ' .
" but i ca n't get a ticket . "

it was a very different day to the euphoria the two of them felt five months earlier when , as newlyweds , they travelled to wembley from their home in portsmouth to see their football team bring home the fa cup trophy .
" it was a lovely day - a day i shall never forget , " mrs gauntlett says , smiling .
now 88 years old , she remembers the 29 april 1939 as if it was yesterday .
" i was wearing a blue dress and a blue and white scarf , " she says .
she also remembers being given a box to stand on to get a better view and her husband had a cracker he spun in his hand while they cheered pompey on .
" everyone was going : ' come on the blues , come on the blues ! ' , " mrs gauntlett recalls .
in the build up to the fa cup final that year , wolverhampton wanderers , who were lying second in the league table , were the favourite to win .
gordon gauntlett left portsmouth to fight in wwii in september 1939 enlarge image but pompey , who were facing relegation at the time , pulled out all the stops to win 4-1 .
" i was hoarse , my voice had gone , " mrs gauntlett says laughing while describing the all-night-long celebration that followed .
" there was no trouble - just singing and dancing . "
after the game finished many pompey supporters , including mr and mrs gauntlett , gathered in the elephant and castle public house , where they celebrated until the early hours .
they even nearly missed the last train home from london .
" this landlord said : ' you all pompey supporters , you 've got to get the train , the last train is the milk train .
if you want to get home you 've got to go ! ' .
" we were all going to waterloo station singing and dancing . "
when they arrived in portsmouth in the early hours people were still out in the streets celebrating .
but mr gauntlett , who worked for a wholesale newsagent , had to take his wife home and then go straight to work .
mrs gauntlett has passed on her passion for pompey to her family " i went straight to bed of course , " mrs gauntlett says .
by september that year , war had broken out and mr gauntlett was sent to france , where he ended up on the beaches of dunkirk .
he survived the battle by swimming to a rescue boat and ended up in hospital in aldershot .
but at home in portsmouth , mrs gauntlett had received a letter saying her husband was missing in action .
she thought he had been killed .
until he turned up again in portsmouth .
" he pinched a sergeant 's uniform cause he 'd had enough and walked out , " mrs gauntlett says as she describes how he sneaked out of hospital and returned home .
but he was soon sent back to france , where he " was lucky " to end up as a cook at a chateau used by the allied forces instead of at the frontline .
mr gauntlett , who remained a pompey supporter all his life , died in 1997 .
no ticket their son gordon jnr inherited his parents love for the football club .
he was one of the brains behind portsmouth fc 's sos campaign in the 1970s - an action group trying to raise about £ 100,000 to get the club out of debt - and later became one of the directors of the club .
" we used to go every saturday they were playing at home .
i could n't go to the away games because i had young children at home . "
and despite being nearly 90 , mrs gauntlett remains a faithful pompey supporter and follows every game they play , either on tv or the radio .
she says it would be her dream to be able to return to wembley for pompey 's the fa cup final on 17 may against cardiff city , pompey 's first since the 1939 win .
but because the 25,000 tickets available for pompey supporters were reserved for club members and season ticket holders , mrs gauntlett has been unable to get a ticket .
" i 've never heard of anyone who goes to football at 88 , " she says .
" but when i was asked if i would go , i said : ' of course i would go ' .
" but i ca n't get a ticket . "

it was a very different day to the euphoria the two of them felt five months earlier when , as newlyweds , they travelled to wembley from their home in portsmouth to see their football team bring home the fa cup trophy .
" it was a lovely day - a day i shall never forget , " mrs gauntlett says , smiling .
now 88 years old , she remembers the 29 april 1939 as if it was yesterday .
" i was wearing a blue dress and a blue and white scarf , " she says .
she also remembers being given a box to stand on to get a better view and her husband had a cracker he spun in his hand while they cheered pompey on .
" everyone was going : ' come on the blues , come on the blues ! ' , " mrs gauntlett recalls .
in the build up to the fa cup final that year , wolverhampton wanderers , who were lying second in the league table , were the favourite to win .
gordon gauntlett left portsmouth to fight in wwii in september 1939 enlarge image but pompey , who were facing relegation at the time , pulled out all the stops to win 4-1 .
" i was hoarse , my voice had gone , " mrs gauntlett says laughing while describing the all-night-long celebration that followed .
" there was no trouble - just singing and dancing . "
after the game finished many pompey supporters , including mr and mrs gauntlett , gathered in the elephant and castle public house , where they celebrated until the early hours .
they even nearly missed the last train home from london .
" this landlord said : ' you all pompey supporters , you 've got to get the train , the last train is the milk train .
if you want to get home you 've got to go ! ' .
" we were all going to waterloo station singing and dancing . "
when they arrived in portsmouth in the early hours people were still out in the streets celebrating .
but mr gauntlett , who worked for a wholesale newsagent , had to take his wife home and then go straight to work .
mrs gauntlett has passed on her passion for pompey to her family " i went straight to bed of course , " mrs gauntlett says .
by september that year , war had broken out and mr gauntlett was sent to france , where he ended up on the beaches of dunkirk .
he survived the battle by swimming to a rescue boat and ended up in hospital in aldershot .
but at home in portsmouth , mrs gauntlett had received a letter saying her husband was missing in action .
she thought he had been killed .
until he turned up again in portsmouth .
" he pinched a sergeant 's uniform cause he 'd had enough and walked out , " mrs gauntlett says as she describes how he sneaked out of hospital and returned home .

writing for the bbc scotland news website , scottish labour leader wendy alexander reflects on the last 12 months .
style rather than substance has been the mark of the snp minority government 's first year in office ... and it 's all been about alex .
wendy alexander said the government was heavy on spin the first minister has positioned himself as a purveyor of populist policies .
ever keen to grab an easy headline .
it 's been a different story when alex salmond 's administration is put under scrutiny .
then it is exposed as government-lite .
heavy on spin , light on substance .
and when it comes to the big issues , his administration has been a big let down .
scrutiny of their flagship policy - local income tax - has exposed it as woefully ill-thought out .
as for the scottish futures trust , it is so lightweight no amount of government spin can hide the overwhelmingly negative response to the consultation on their plans .
and what has happened to investment in our school infrastructure ?
no new schools projects have been commissioned under the snp .
meanwhile the council tax freeze is beginning to bite .
labour was accused of " scaremongering " when we warned of cuts in local services , but now the impact is hitting councils across the country from aberdeen to edinburgh .
when it comes to planning for scotland 's future , the snp have been found wanting and then there are the broken promises .
a year ago they promised to dump student debt , reduce class sizes , match labour 's school building programme and introduce grants for first-time house buyers .
promises they solemnly made to the people of scotland - but pledges they 've broken with barely a murmur of apology .
but the reality behind the first minister 's rhetoric is n't confined to cuts .
when it comes to planning for scotland 's future , the snp have been found wanting .
they have slashed adult modern apprenticeships in scotland by nearly 80 % .
on the evidence of this past year , the snp government should spend more time taking the long-term decisions - some of them tough ones - that scotland expects its government to take .
meanwhile , alex salmond speculates about securing independence - he 's been doing it for years .
but who really believes there is majority support for independence ?
if alex salmond did , he would push for a referendum now .
labour believes scots want to walk tall in the union , not to walk out .

writing for the bbc scotland news website , scottish conservative leader annabel goldie reflects on the last 12 months .
we 're not far off a year since we entered uncharted waters in scotland 's political ocean .
annabel goldie said the real winners under minority rule would be the public last may , the scottish parliament election delivered the first defeat to labour in this country since 1955 .
nearly 12 months on from that historic day the snp , after forming the government , have increased their lead in the opinion polls and labour are in utter disarray .
why are the snp riding high ?
it is n't because the public is buying independence .
the reason is very simple ; the snp is not the labour party everyone was fed up with the main governing party at last year 's election , and were looking for a change .
the snp were in an ideal position to deliver that .
there is a feelgood factor in scottish politics which has little to do with alex salmond .
i believed coalition politics was stale .
in short , minority government deserved a shot .
i felt with minority government the real winners would be the scottish public .
the scottish conservatives have played their hand extremely effectively .
we worked with the snp government , agreeing to support its budget in exchange for key concessions .
minority government requires constant work and , in this new chapter of scottish politics , the journey has only just begun scottish conservatives gave scotland 1,000 additional police officers , accelerated cuts in business rates for 150,000 small scottish businesses , launched a new chapter in the battle against drugs abuse and kept bus fares down .
and where we disagree with the nationalists - and there is plenty of scope for that - we have fought against their proposals .
we reject a national income tax that would punish hard-working families and , when the snp have threatened our country by wandering down the separatist road , we have opposed them tooth and nail .
the bottom line is that 16 scottish conservative msps have achieved more than scottish labour , who have 46 msps .
there are some who say that , as committed unionists , we should never sup with the devil .
that view is wrong .
that view would be bad for scotland .
the scottish parliament is at its best when it gets on with devolved responsibilities .
headlines in the next few weeks will doubtless concern themselves with a year of the snp being ' in power ' .
i can understand this focus .
however , it does n't tell the whole story , or even half the story .

writing for the bbc scotland news website , scottish conservative leader annabel goldie reflects on the last 12 months .
we 're not far off a year since we entered uncharted waters in scotland 's political ocean .
annabel goldie said the real winners under minority rule would be the public last may , the scottish parliament election delivered the first defeat to labour in this country since 1955 .
nearly 12 months on from that historic day the snp , after forming the government , have increased their lead in the opinion polls and labour are in utter disarray .
why are the snp riding high ?
it is n't because the public is buying independence .
the reason is very simple ; the snp is not the labour party everyone was fed up with the main governing party at last year 's election , and were looking for a change .
the snp were in an ideal position to deliver that .
there is a feelgood factor in scottish politics which has little to do with alex salmond .
i believed coalition politics was stale .
in short , minority government deserved a shot .
i felt with minority government the real winners would be the scottish public .
the scottish conservatives have played their hand extremely effectively .
we worked with the snp government , agreeing to support its budget in exchange for key concessions .
minority government requires constant work and , in this new chapter of scottish politics , the journey has only just begun scottish conservatives gave scotland 1,000 additional police officers , accelerated cuts in business rates for 150,000 small scottish businesses , launched a new chapter in the battle against drugs abuse and kept bus fares down .
and where we disagree with the nationalists - and there is plenty of scope for that - we have fought against their proposals .
we reject a national income tax that would punish hard-working families and , when the snp have threatened our country by wandering down the separatist road , we have opposed them tooth and nail .
the bottom line is that 16 scottish conservative msps have achieved more than scottish labour , who have 46 msps .
there are some who say that , as committed unionists , we should never sup with the devil .
that view is wrong .
that view would be bad for scotland .
the scottish parliament is at its best when it gets on with devolved responsibilities .
headlines in the next few weeks will doubtless concern themselves with a year of the snp being ' in power ' .
i can understand this focus .
however , it does n't tell the whole story , or even half the story .

writing for the bbc scotland news website , scottish green leader robin harper reflects on the last 12 months .
it 's hard to be kind about the snp government 's record on the environment and climate change .
robin harper said government transport policy was too car-dependent there are some positives , such as ruling out new nuclear plants in scotland while largely backing renewables .
we have also persuaded them to adopt our climate challenge fund , which will fund inspirational community carbon reduction projects .
however , they have little idea how to meet even their limited 2050 target of an 80 % emissions cut .
they have done nothing on insulation , energy efficiency , or improving building standards .
worst of all , their transport policies are even more car-dependent than their predecessors , unlikely as that sounds , and will seriously aggravate emissions .
the costs and dangers of continued dependence on oil are being all too starkly illustrated this week .
the pattern is just as mixed on other issues .
snp ministers have moved away from pfi funding for public sector projects , a misguided policy that has delivered substandard infrastructure and fewer services at greater cost .
it 's parliament 's responsibility as much as the snp 's to ensure that the blight of poverty is lifted yet their scottish futures trust alternative looks like it was drawn up on the back of an envelope .
planning is another disappointment .
the new national planning framework talks a lot about sustainability , yet all but one of the projects it would force through are anything but .
in the north east , the snp have followed the last administration 's lead , sucking up to a rich developer at the expense of an irreplaceable slice of our countryside .
in a parliament of minorities , though , it 's not all down to the snp .
it 's the responsibility of all opposition parties , including the greens , to turn around the government 's outdated oil economics and grasp the opportunities a low carbon economy could bring .
it 's parliament 's responsibility as much as the snp 's to ensure the blight of poverty is lifted across scotland .
the snp administration must work with other parties to make climate change and poverty scotland 's priorities and , if they fail to do so , 2011 will surely mark the end of the nationalist experiment .

by brian taylor political editor , bbc scotland i have a particular fondness for fixed points in journalism .
they are curiously comforting .
mr salmond has every reason to switch on the benign smile for example , the public accounts committee of the house of commons is always described as " influential " .
any politician condemning their own leadership can expect to be billed as " senior " , as if juniors are thought unworthy of independent thought .
more generally , earthquakes are listed according to their status on the richter scale .
they are always said to " measure x.y on the richter scale " .
this is said with due solemnity .
be honest .
do you truly understand the richter scale ?
if told that a quake was 3.1 , would you know instantly whether that was sufficient to fell a city or merely produce a minor disturbance of sleep patterns ?
yet , if denied the richter details , we would somehow feel cheated .
another charmingly fixed point concerns opinion polls .
politicians confronted with positive polls will inevitably smile with benign contentment while stressing that they are " not complacent " .
politicians facing a stinker of an opinion survey will say , without fail , that " the only poll which counts is at the general election " .
this formulation is mandatory .
it may even be in the scotland act .
of late , alex salmond has been deploying the benign smile .
his opponents , notably wendy alexander , have been more reliant on the only poll which counts .
polling is sadly somewhat sporadic in scotland these days , with no media organisation prepared to commission a regular survey which would give us indications of a consistent trend let us look firstly at voting intention .
the salmond smile , never far from his visage , is perhaps understandable .
he led the race in the holyrood general election last may by what one of his new -lrb- or returning -rrb- parliamentary colleagues would undoubtedly call a " baw hair " .
the colleague who used that emotive phrase on a previous occasion was kenny gibson .
by delicious irony , it was mr gibson 's remarkable victory over labour in cunninghame north which added the final hair to the ... let 's not go there .
since then , however , the snp has appeared to thrive in the holyrood polls .
polling is sadly somewhat sporadic in scotland these days , with no media organisation prepared to commission a regular survey which would give us indications of a consistent trend .
however , since the election , the snp has seemingly strengthened its position , sitting in the lead and in the upper 30s at least , with the exception of a single poll .
indeed , a recent scottish opinion poll for the daily mail suggested the snp had reached 40 % in popular holyrood support , with labour on 33 , tories third on 13 and the liberal democrats fourth on 10 .
' intriguing picture ' couple of caveats .
as noted above , there are now relatively few polls in scotland .
further , we are three years from the next holyrood election .
such polls as there have been on westminster voting intention suggest that the snp might be , at best , neck and neck with labour , reflecting a trend whereby the snp tend to perform better at holyrood .
however , mr salmond has every reason to switch on the benign smile .
after a year in office , it would appear that his popularity has increased .
that is borne out by other surveys suggesting that his personal standing remains high .
let us look next at popular opinion with regard to independence .
this presents a truly intriguing picture - with one or two fascinating caveats .
firstly , that picture .
glance at certain surveys and it would seem independence has moved forward as an option in popular opinion since the elections in may .
for example , system three / tns for the sunday herald discerned 35 % support for independence as against 50 % opposition when they surveyed opinion in august 2007 .
by april 2008 , the same polling organisation , commissioned by the same paper , found an apparent turn-around with 41 % favouring independence and 40 % opposed .
opinion on independence may be taking the pre-election position by contrast , glance at yougov in the telegraph this week .
it suggests that , by 59 to 25 , voters prefer to retain the present scottish parliament over the option of " a completely separate state outside the uk " .
let us look into this a little more closely .
glance back a little further .
for example , in january 2007 , icm for the mail found an apparent approval rating of 51 % for scotland becoming independent , against 36 % disapproval .
it could be argued , in some polls , opinion on this issue is largely returning to its pre-election position .
a second caveat .
popular opinion on this issue has tended to vary down the decades , apparently influenced by the wording of the question .
any wording that refers to " ending the union " or some such disruptive outcome , as opposed to stressing scottish independence , has tended to generate notably lower support .
caveat number three .
we have dealt thus far with polls which pose a straight choice : independence , yea or nay .
polls which offer other options tend to paint a different picture with apparently substantial support for devolution with enhanced powers .
for example , this week 's telegraph poll suggested additional powers attracted more support than either independence or the status quo .
this could all be telling us a story about a putative referendum .
if it is a straight choice over independence , then the outcome could hinge on which argument is to the fore , whose voice is heard .
would voters heed the nationalist case that independence would be liberating , would help scotland enhance its status ?
if asked , people in scotland seem overwhelmingly to favour the notion of a referendum on the constitutional future or would they hear the unionist language : that the snp would end the union , would break from britain ?
if the referendum is a three-way choice , including the option of added powers , then it appears that the voters might go for that .
final word .
there is one relatively fixed point in the fluid world of opinion surveys .
if asked , people in scotland seem overwhelmingly to favour the notion of a referendum on the constitutional future .
they like the concept of being asked to deliver their verdict .
which presents another potential opportunity for mr salmond .
say he advances his proposal for a referendum : either a straight choice over independence or a multi-option ballot including the alternative of devolution max .
say that suggestion is thwarted by the first minister 's political opponents at holyrood .
mr salmond could perhaps then look for popular sympathy if and when he voices righteous indignation at the subsequent scottish parliamentary elections .
is it any wonder he 's smiling ?

by brian taylor political editor , bbc scotland i have a particular fondness for fixed points in journalism .
they are curiously comforting .
mr salmond has every reason to switch on the benign smile for example , the public accounts committee of the house of commons is always described as " influential " .
any politician condemning their own leadership can expect to be billed as " senior " , as if juniors are thought unworthy of independent thought .
more generally , earthquakes are listed according to their status on the richter scale .
they are always said to " measure x.y on the richter scale " .
this is said with due solemnity .
be honest .
do you truly understand the richter scale ?
if told that a quake was 3.1 , would you know instantly whether that was sufficient to fell a city or merely produce a minor disturbance of sleep patterns ?
yet , if denied the richter details , we would somehow feel cheated .
another charmingly fixed point concerns opinion polls .
politicians confronted with positive polls will inevitably smile with benign contentment while stressing that they are " not complacent " .
politicians facing a stinker of an opinion survey will say , without fail , that " the only poll which counts is at the general election " .
this formulation is mandatory .
it may even be in the scotland act .
of late , alex salmond has been deploying the benign smile .
his opponents , notably wendy alexander , have been more reliant on the only poll which counts .
polling is sadly somewhat sporadic in scotland these days , with no media organisation prepared to commission a regular survey which would give us indications of a consistent trend let us look firstly at voting intention .
the salmond smile , never far from his visage , is perhaps understandable .
he led the race in the holyrood general election last may by what one of his new -lrb- or returning -rrb- parliamentary colleagues would undoubtedly call a " baw hair " .
the colleague who used that emotive phrase on a previous occasion was kenny gibson .
by delicious irony , it was mr gibson 's remarkable victory over labour in cunninghame north which added the final hair to the ... let 's not go there .
since then , however , the snp has appeared to thrive in the holyrood polls .
polling is sadly somewhat sporadic in scotland these days , with no media organisation prepared to commission a regular survey which would give us indications of a consistent trend .
however , since the election , the snp has seemingly strengthened its position , sitting in the lead and in the upper 30s at least , with the exception of a single poll .
indeed , a recent scottish opinion poll for the daily mail suggested the snp had reached 40 % in popular holyrood support , with labour on 33 , tories third on 13 and the liberal democrats fourth on 10 .
' intriguing picture ' couple of caveats .
as noted above , there are now relatively few polls in scotland .
further , we are three years from the next holyrood election .
such polls as there have been on westminster voting intention suggest that the snp might be , at best , neck and neck with labour , reflecting a trend whereby the snp tend to perform better at holyrood .
however , mr salmond has every reason to switch on the benign smile .
after a year in office , it would appear that his popularity has increased .
that is borne out by other surveys suggesting that his personal standing remains high .
let us look next at popular opinion with regard to independence .
this presents a truly intriguing picture - with one or two fascinating caveats .
firstly , that picture .
glance at certain surveys and it would seem independence has moved forward as an option in popular opinion since the elections in may .
for example , system three / tns for the sunday herald discerned 35 % support for independence as against 50 % opposition when they surveyed opinion in august 2007 .
by april 2008 , the same polling organisation , commissioned by the same paper , found an apparent turn-around with 41 % favouring independence and 40 % opposed .
opinion on independence may be taking the pre-election position by contrast , glance at yougov in the telegraph this week .
it suggests that , by 59 to 25 , voters prefer to retain the present scottish parliament over the option of " a completely separate state outside the uk " .
let us look into this a little more closely .
glance back a little further .
for example , in january 2007 , icm for the mail found an apparent approval rating of 51 % for scotland becoming independent , against 36 % disapproval .
it could be argued , in some polls , opinion on this issue is largely returning to its pre-election position .
a second caveat .
popular opinion on this issue has tended to vary down the decades , apparently influenced by the wording of the question .
any wording that refers to " ending the union " or some such disruptive outcome , as opposed to stressing scottish independence , has tended to generate notably lower support .
caveat number three .
we have dealt thus far with polls which pose a straight choice : independence , yea or nay .
polls which offer other options tend to paint a different picture with apparently substantial support for devolution with enhanced powers .
for example , this week 's telegraph poll suggested additional powers attracted more support than either independence or the status quo .
this could all be telling us a story about a putative referendum .
if it is a straight choice over independence , then the outcome could hinge on which argument is to the fore , whose voice is heard .
would voters heed the nationalist case that independence would be liberating , would help scotland enhance its status ?
if asked , people in scotland seem overwhelmingly to favour the notion of a referendum on the constitutional future or would they hear the unionist language : that the snp would end the union , would break from britain ?
if the referendum is a three-way choice , including the option of added powers , then it appears that the voters might go for that .
final word .
there is one relatively fixed point in the fluid world of opinion surveys .
if asked , people in scotland seem overwhelmingly to favour the notion of a referendum on the constitutional future .
they like the concept of being asked to deliver their verdict .
which presents another potential opportunity for mr salmond .
say he advances his proposal for a referendum : either a straight choice over independence or a multi-option ballot including the alternative of devolution max .
say that suggestion is thwarted by the first minister 's political opponents at holyrood .
mr salmond could perhaps then look for popular sympathy if and when he voices righteous indignation at the subsequent scottish parliamentary elections .
is it any wonder he 's smiling ?

writing for the bbc scotland news website , scottish liberal democrat leader nicol stephen reflects on the last 12 months .
the things people remember most about the snp are how they were prepared to say anything to get elected and then broke the promises when they got in .
mr stephen said his party was delivering in its new role breaking the promise to scrap student debt , the promise of smaller class sizes , the promise to give grants to first-time house buyers .
as their term in office continues , more and more people will object to this chameleon politics .
they are storing up problems and ducking the big issues .
our contributions in the chamber have hit home and have impressed commentators .
remember , it was the liberal democrats who were so effective in exposing the broken promises from the snp - cutting investment in universities , backtracking on new schools , uncovering fiddled hospital waiting lists , exposing proposed new student tuition fees and , perhaps most shockingly , catching the snp writing a friendly letter to robert mugabe .
far from confidently governing with a clear agenda , the snp have lost a series of crucial votes on the floor of the chamber .
their u-turn on whether to recruit 1,000 extra police officers was defeated and they had to change their budget .
the skills strategy they presented to parliament was thrown out and they were told to come back with something better .
and on transport , the snp plan to scrap the edinburgh trams was rejected by all the other parties .
the scottish liberal democrats are meeting the challenge of our new role as the most effective opposition party in scotland .
of course , we support the government when it does things we agree with - abolishing the graduate endowment or scrapping council tax .
but our job in opposition is to hold the snp to account .

his comments came a year after the snp 's historic holyrood election win .
mr salmond said the minority administration had delivered for public services , while dealing with national issues like the glasgow airport attack .
but rival parties accused the nationalists of breaking promises and " style over substance " politics .
mr salmond said his government had made scots ' lives better through policies such as freezing council tax and scrapping the student graduate endowment , while building support for an independence referendum .
he said scotland had faced up to major challenges , including the grangemouth refinery strike and the glasgow airport attack - and warned the nation was not immune from current global financial problems .

advertisement highlights and lowlights from the snp 's year in power " almost one year ago we said that it was time for scotland to move forward , " mr salmond told the bbc scotland news website .
" the people of scotland agreed and they entrusted us with government .
" we are repaying the trust of the people of scotland by breathing new life into scottish democracy , and delivering for our great public services . "
but scottish labour leader wendy alexander said style rather than substance had been the mark of the scottish government in its first year .
" a year ago they promised to dump student debt , reduce class sizes , match labour 's school building programme and introduce first time house buyers grants , " she said .
" promises they solemnly made to the people of scotland , but pledges they 've broken with barely a murmur of apology . "
there is a feelgood factor in scottish politics which has little to do with alex salmond annabel goldie scottish tory leader the science of opinion polls annabel goldie , the scottish tory leader , claimed the snp was " riding high " in the polls , not because of support for independence , but because they were not the labour party - which led holyrood 's coalition government for eight years .
" there is a feelgood factor in scottish politics which has little to do with alex salmond , " she said , adding : " i felt with minority government , the real winners would be the scottish public . "
miss goldie also said her party had extracted key government budget concessions on boosting police and cutting business rates .
scottish liberal democrat leader nicol stephen claimed the snp was prepared to say anything to get into government , adding : " far from confidently governing with a clear agenda , the snp have lost a series of crucial votes on the floor of the chamber .
" their u-turn on whether to recruit 1,000 extra police officers was defeated , the skills strategy was thrown out and the plan to scrap the edinburgh trams was rejected by all the other parties . "
scottish green leader robin harper said it was " hard to be kind " about the government 's record on the environment , but welcomed the ruling out of new nuclear power stations and its climate change fund .

the lucky voice business was set up by internet entrepreneur martha lane fox , who is a non-executive director of m & s. investors had complained that sir stuart 's stake could compromise ms lane fox 's independence .
" i have unwound the investment in lucky voice . " the m & s boss said .
" perhaps it should be called unlucky voice . "
' heart-racing ' sir stuart did not see any conflict of interest , a spokesman for the retailer said .
" but he does n't want such a small point to distract from the bigger issues of managing the group , " he added .
m & s investors had already been upset by sir stuart 's decision to promote himself to combine the roles of chief executive and chairman - which goes against city recommendations on corporate governance practice .
sir stuart has conceded the firm could have " done a better job of explaining " the decision .
ms lane fox made her fortune through founding lastminute.com.
her roles at m & s include a seat on the remuneration committee which sets the levels of executive pay - including that of sir stuart .
lucky voice , which began in london 's soho , describes itself as " the most liberating , heart-racing , life-affirming private karaoke experience on earth " .

the group says there are " grave concerns about arbitrariness and discrimination " in processes leading to the death penalty .
it says 135 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice .
indian authorities say the death penalty is rarely carried out and is usually reserved for serious cases .
apart from a single execution in 2004 , there have been no executions in the country in the past ten years .
a 1983 ruling by the country 's supreme court stated that the death penalty should be imposed only in " the rarest of rare cases " .
only particularly horrific or politically sensitive cases have attracted the penalty .
' gross underestimate ' in a new report , amnesty disputes this and says the indian government does not disclose how many people have been executed and how many are awaiting execution today .
it says , according to official figures , there were 273 people awaiting the death penalty in indian prisons as at the end of december 2005 .
the group says it " believes this figure to be a gross underestimate " .
it says at least 140 people are believed to have been sentenced to death in india in 2006 and 2007 .
it is not clear how the group arrived at the figure .
indian prison authorities denounced amnesty 's claim that there was no transparency about prisoners on death row in india .
" death sentences are carried out under court orders .
every order is recorded and prison records sent to the federal government regularly .
there is nothing hush-hush about it , " said bd sharma , the chief of prisons in eastern west bengal state .
" such claims are totally sensational , " he said .
to put things into perspective , he said , in a big state like west bengal , there were 12 prisoners on death row , down from 17 a few years ago .
amnesty says it studied death penalty cases in collaboration with the indian rights group people 's union of civil liberties -lrb- pucl -rrb- for its latest report .
it says that most death sentences handed down in india are based solely on circumstantial evidence .
fabricated evidence the report says " innocent people " have been sentenced to death on the basis of " false and fabricated evidence , often used in manipulated investigations and prosecutions , with investigating and prosecuting agencies acting in collusion " .
amnesty urged the government to ensure that the death penalty was not imposed on anyone suffering from mental disability .
pucl president dr v suresh said there is a danger of the death penalty being " used disproportionately against ethnic minorities , the poor or other disadvantaged groups " .
" there is only one way to ensure such inequalities in the administration of justice do not occur : the complete abolition of the death penalty . "
in india the death penalty is carried out by hanging .
an attempt to challenge this method failed in the supreme court , which stated in its 1983 judgement that hanging did not involve torture , barbarity , humiliation or degradation .
under indian law , the death penalty can be imposed for murder , gang robbery with murder , abetting the suicide of a child or insane person , waging war against the government , and abetting mutiny by a member of the armed forces .
in recent years , however , special courts have also extended the penalty to cases of terrorism under anti-terror legislation .
some people are pushing for it to be used against rapists .
last year , a former member of the indian parliament , anand mohan , was sentenced to death for his role in a mob killing 13 years ago .
an indian soldier was also sentenced to death for killing his superior in indian-administered kashmir last may .
the assassins of india 's independence leader , mahatma gandhi , and former prime minister indira gandhi were among those executed in the past 60 years e-mail this to a friend related to this story : death penalty for mumbai bomber -lrb- 27 jul 07 -pipe- south asia -rrb- indian soldier sentenced to death -lrb- 25 may 07 -pipe- south asia -rrb- indian ex-mp is sentenced to die -lrb- 03 oct 07 -pipe- south asia -rrb- villagers mourn hanged indian convict -lrb- 14 aug 04 -pipe- south asia -rrb- president rejects clemency plea -lrb- 04 aug 04 -pipe- south asia -rrb- capital punishment : a family business -lrb- 24 jun 04 -pipe- south asia -rrb- india and the death penalty -lrb- 18 dec 02 -pipe- south asia -rrb- stay of execution over india raid -lrb- 20 feb 04 -pipe- south asia -rrb- death sentences over bus attack -lrb- 29 jan 04 -pipe- south asia -rrb- related internet links indian home ministry amnesty international president of india supreme court of india the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©
