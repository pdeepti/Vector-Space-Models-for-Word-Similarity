program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 04.02.2008 confusion over mystery man 's identity continues in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " karl " has adjusted well to life in germany , even though he does not speak german " karl " says he is german and wants to remain in germany , but official documents say he is someone else who is british .
the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de language provides a hint about amnesiac 's identity police in heidelberg said they think they know where a man claiming to suffer from memory loss comes from .
the man , who calls himself " karl , " is probably from southern england .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .

on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .

rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies .

but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .

canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .

representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu and german officials welcomed the outcome . pro-western boris tadic got a second term as serbia 's president on sunday , sparking celebrations on the streets of belgrade despite fears over kosovo 's looming independence . tadics opponent tomislav nikolic conceded defeat at a rally of his radical party in the serbian capital . tadic , who wants closer ties with the european union , had 51.1 percent of the vote against 47.2 percent for nikolic , a former ally of late serbian dictator slobodan milosevic and an ultra-nationalist who favors greater links to russia . with kosovo and serbia 's future direction inspiring the electorate , cesid , a belgrade-based election-monitoring organization , said the turnout of 6.7 million votes was 67.7 percent - the highest since milosevic was defeated in elections in 2000 . in the jan .

" the serbian people have stressed that they see the future of serbia within europe , " he said .
" that is good news for the whole of europe . " steg added that the german government was willing to support serbia on its road to europe , adding that a new cooperation agreement between the eu and serbia , expected to be signed on thursday , will help in that respect . " we trust that serbia will take the neccersary steps to move towards even closer ties with the eu , " he said . kosovo problem blocks eu aspirations the eu 's slovenian presidency also congratulated tadic on his victory , saying it reflected the country 's democratic resolve to join the bloc .

" the serbian people have stressed that they see the future of serbia within europe , " he said .
" that is good news for the whole of europe . " steg added that the german government was willing to support serbia on its road to europe , adding that a new cooperation agreement between the eu and serbia , expected to be signed on thursday , will help in that respect . " we trust that serbia will take the neccersary steps to move towards even closer ties with the eu , " he said . kosovo problem blocks eu aspirations the eu 's slovenian presidency also congratulated tadic on his victory , saying it reflected the country 's democratic resolve to join the bloc .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa said it was his " firm belief that serbia would very soon succeed in meeting the criteria required in order to proceed along this path . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian soldiers serving in kfor walk past the posters showing presidential candidate tomislav nikolic the eu made no mention of the other serbian issue high on its agenda - the expected declaration of independence from the breakaway republic of kosovo .
ethnic albanian leaders in the province have threatened to unilaterally declare independence within days of the election . both serbian presidential candidates had opposed independence , a move which is supported by the eu and the united states .
last week , the 27 eu nations finalized preparations for a civilian mission to help ease kosovo 's transition to independence .
it will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and judicial experts , one diplomat said . promise of a brighter future tadic used the promise of a brighter future in a serbia with strong links to the european union to motivate young voters to turn out in force . " everyone must go to vote today in the elections ...
we have a form of a referendum about the path serbia will take , " tadic said after casting his ballot in belgrade . " i expect voters will choose a continuation of the reforms started in october 2000 , " added the 50-year-old tadic , a trained psychologist . however , tadic failed to win the support of conservative nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica , who wanted him to take a tougher line against eu support for an independent kosovo . nikolic , a 55-year-old former undertaker , sought votes from kostunica 's camp , as well as from among the losers of serbia 's delayed transition from years of economic mismanagement under communism and the milosevic regime . nikolic : " russia is a closer partner " " serbia is close to the european union and russia , but at this time russia is a closer partner than the eu because it can make development possible for serbia , " he said after casting his vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic casts his ballot on sunday , feb .
3 in belgrade , a war-weary city so often at the crossroads of the region 's turbulent history , voters said they were torn between a future in the eu and losing kosovo . kosovo serbs also voted , some in the hope that their choice will help keep the province in serbia , others resigned to splitting from their motherland . leading up to the election , nato and the united nations bolstered troops and international police in kosovo . the un has run kosovo since nato 's 1999 air war drove out serb forces waging a crackdown on separatist albanians who comprise about 90 percent of the province 's 2 million population . most serbs consider the tiny territory the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christianity . dw staff -lrb- nda / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de language provides a hint about amnesiac 's identity police in heidelberg said they think they know where a man claiming to suffer from memory loss comes from .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .

" there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals .

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .
opponents fear the islamification of turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are concerned about sharia law the government has argued that the changes are a women 's rights issue but opponents fear that the moves are part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that the islamic-rooted government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ultimately seeks to impose sharia law .
on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .

akp election result leads to headscarf debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish pm erdogan with his wife emine wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced .
rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .

representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's sanja blagojevic says that it 's now time for tadic to share some unpleasant truths with his people . serbia has sided with europe .
boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .
despite all fears , serbia in the end voted against the radicals and against an orientation towards russia . president tadic once again banked on the politically enlightened group of serbs , who are aware how dangerous the radicals are for the country .
his plan worked out and he won . but fear of radicals alone can not serve as a basis for politics in the long term .
serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .
but kostunica 's tactic backfired . now , with victory in the bag , tadic could finally begin to talk about things that have long been avoided . he needs to tell serbians the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it is .
truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals .

he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .

several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .

" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .

it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .

he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .

but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .

" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de language provides a hint about amnesiac 's identity police in heidelberg said they think they know where a man claiming to suffer from memory loss comes from .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .

eu and german officials welcomed the outcome . pro-western boris tadic got a second term as serbia 's president on sunday , sparking celebrations on the streets of belgrade despite fears over kosovo 's looming independence . tadics opponent tomislav nikolic conceded defeat at a rally of his radical party in the serbian capital . tadic , who wants closer ties with the european union , had 51.1 percent of the vote against 47.2 percent for nikolic , a former ally of late serbian dictator slobodan milosevic and an ultra-nationalist who favors greater links to russia . with kosovo and serbia 's future direction inspiring the electorate , cesid , a belgrade-based election-monitoring organization , said the turnout of 6.7 million votes was 67.7 percent - the highest since milosevic was defeated in elections in 2000 . in the jan .

" the serbian people have stressed that they see the future of serbia within europe , " he said .
" that is good news for the whole of europe . " steg added that the german government was willing to support serbia on its road to europe , adding that a new cooperation agreement between the eu and serbia , expected to be signed on thursday , will help in that respect . " we trust that serbia will take the neccersary steps to move towards even closer ties with the eu , " he said . kosovo problem blocks eu aspirations the eu 's slovenian presidency also congratulated tadic on his victory , saying it reflected the country 's democratic resolve to join the bloc .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa said it was his " firm belief that serbia would very soon succeed in meeting the criteria required in order to proceed along this path .

ethnic albanian leaders in the province have threatened to unilaterally declare independence within days of the election . both serbian presidential candidates had opposed independence , a move which is supported by the eu and the united states .
last week , the 27 eu nations finalized preparations for a civilian mission to help ease kosovo 's transition to independence .
it will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and judicial experts , one diplomat said . promise of a brighter future tadic used the promise of a brighter future in a serbia with strong links to the european union to motivate young voters to turn out in force . " everyone must go to vote today in the elections ...
we have a form of a referendum about the path serbia will take , " tadic said after casting his ballot in belgrade . " i expect voters will choose a continuation of the reforms started in october 2000 , " added the 50-year-old tadic , a trained psychologist . however , tadic failed to win the support of conservative nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica , who wanted him to take a tougher line against eu support for an independent kosovo . nikolic , a 55-year-old former undertaker , sought votes from kostunica 's camp , as well as from among the losers of serbia 's delayed transition from years of economic mismanagement under communism and the milosevic regime . nikolic : " russia is a closer partner " " serbia is close to the european union and russia , but at this time russia is a closer partner than the eu because it can make development possible for serbia , " he said after casting his vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic casts his ballot on sunday , feb .

in addition , they seized growing equipment such as heat lamps and an air pump for the plants . german states treat marijuana abuse with varying degrees of tolerance ; it is illegal everywhere in the country , but police often react to the smell of the drug only if , for instance , a driver is suspected of consuming it .
for the most part , german police are too stretched to control suspected plantations . " we have to see what the investigations reveal , " ulrich kaminski , press spokesman of the justice ministry in north-rhine westphalia told daily mindener tageblatt . police however have already opened a probe against the lawyer and the judge , who were traced from the grow shop 's customer lists .
experts examined a laptop to find out the extent of the drug racket .
they have already indicated that the legal duo was n't just producing cannabis for their own consumption but seemed to be supplementing their legal incomes with the lucrative plantation . it remains unclear whether the two legal eagles will defend themselves or hire lawyers in a case that is bound to grip the town 's local media . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .

on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .
the opposition republican people 's party has vowed to go to the constitutional court in an attempt to block the changes .

rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .
opponents fear the islamification of turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are concerned about sharia law the government has argued that the changes are a women 's rights issue but opponents fear that the moves are part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that the islamic-rooted government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ultimately seeks to impose sharia law .
on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .
the opposition republican people 's party has vowed to go to the constitutional court in an attempt to block the changes .
akp election result leads to headscarf debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish pm erdogan with his wife emine wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced .
rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.02.2008 french parliament paves way for ratification of eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constitutional revisions are the first step towards ratification of eu treaty both houses of the french parliament voted on monday , feb .
4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .

since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .

höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.02.2008 tv casting show accused of damaging germany 's youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of german kids watched mark medlock win the last " dsds " series after the nervous breakdown of a 17-year-old , two german bodies concerned with the protection of young people have criticized broadcaster rtl for the way contestants are treated on the german version of pop idol . the german cultural council -lrb- kulturrat -rrb- accused rtl of displaying a " malicious disregard " for humanity on the talent show , commonly referred to as " dsds . "
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "

boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .

serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.02.2008 britain to send students to auschwitz to learn about holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you get teenagers to connect with events that took place more than 60 years ago ?
the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu and german officials welcomed the outcome . pro-western boris tadic got a second term as serbia 's president on sunday , sparking celebrations on the streets of belgrade despite fears over kosovo 's looming independence . tadics opponent tomislav nikolic conceded defeat at a rally of his radical party in the serbian capital . tadic , who wants closer ties with the european union , had 51.1 percent of the vote against 47.2 percent for nikolic , a former ally of late serbian dictator slobodan milosevic and an ultra-nationalist who favors greater links to russia . with kosovo and serbia 's future direction inspiring the electorate , cesid , a belgrade-based election-monitoring organization , said the turnout of 6.7 million votes was 67.7 percent - the highest since milosevic was defeated in elections in 2000 . in the jan .
20 first round , nikolic came out in front with 40 percent of votes , against tadic 's 35 percent and experts had expected a very narrow runoff . germany offers assistance germany 's government welcomed tadic 's re-election . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin had noted " with pleasure " the outcome of the run-off poll . " the serbian people have stressed that they see the future of serbia within europe , " he said .
" that is good news for the whole of europe . " steg added that the german government was willing to support serbia on its road to europe , adding that a new cooperation agreement between the eu and serbia , expected to be signed on thursday , will help in that respect . " we trust that serbia will take the neccersary steps to move towards even closer ties with the eu , " he said . kosovo problem blocks eu aspirations the eu 's slovenian presidency also congratulated tadic on his victory , saying it reflected the country 's democratic resolve to join the bloc .

" everyone must go to vote today in the elections ...
we have a form of a referendum about the path serbia will take , " tadic said after casting his ballot in belgrade . " i expect voters will choose a continuation of the reforms started in october 2000 , " added the 50-year-old tadic , a trained psychologist . however , tadic failed to win the support of conservative nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica , who wanted him to take a tougher line against eu support for an independent kosovo . nikolic , a 55-year-old former undertaker , sought votes from kostunica 's camp , as well as from among the losers of serbia 's delayed transition from years of economic mismanagement under communism and the milosevic regime . nikolic : " russia is a closer partner " " serbia is close to the european union and russia , but at this time russia is a closer partner than the eu because it can make development possible for serbia , " he said after casting his vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic casts his ballot on sunday , feb .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .

several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "

it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .

the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .

gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .

representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .

us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.02.2008 britain to send students to auschwitz to learn about holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you get teenagers to connect with events that took place more than 60 years ago ?
the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu and german officials welcomed the outcome . pro-western boris tadic got a second term as serbia 's president on sunday , sparking celebrations on the streets of belgrade despite fears over kosovo 's looming independence . tadics opponent tomislav nikolic conceded defeat at a rally of his radical party in the serbian capital . tadic , who wants closer ties with the european union , had 51.1 percent of the vote against 47.2 percent for nikolic , a former ally of late serbian dictator slobodan milosevic and an ultra-nationalist who favors greater links to russia . with kosovo and serbia 's future direction inspiring the electorate , cesid , a belgrade-based election-monitoring organization , said the turnout of 6.7 million votes was 67.7 percent - the highest since milosevic was defeated in elections in 2000 . in the jan .

" steg added that the german government was willing to support serbia on its road to europe , adding that a new cooperation agreement between the eu and serbia , expected to be signed on thursday , will help in that respect . " we trust that serbia will take the neccersary steps to move towards even closer ties with the eu , " he said . kosovo problem blocks eu aspirations the eu 's slovenian presidency also congratulated tadic on his victory , saying it reflected the country 's democratic resolve to join the bloc .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa said it was his " firm belief that serbia would very soon succeed in meeting the criteria required in order to proceed along this path .

ethnic albanian leaders in the province have threatened to unilaterally declare independence within days of the election . both serbian presidential candidates had opposed independence , a move which is supported by the eu and the united states .
last week , the 27 eu nations finalized preparations for a civilian mission to help ease kosovo 's transition to independence .
it will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and judicial experts , one diplomat said . promise of a brighter future tadic used the promise of a brighter future in a serbia with strong links to the european union to motivate young voters to turn out in force .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .

on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .
opponents fear the islamification of turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are concerned about sharia law the government has argued that the changes are a women 's rights issue but opponents fear that the moves are part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that the islamic-rooted government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ultimately seeks to impose sharia law .
on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .
the opposition republican people 's party has vowed to go to the constitutional court in an attempt to block the changes .
akp election result leads to headscarf debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish pm erdogan with his wife emine wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced .
rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the main aim of angela merkel ’ s visits to india and china last year was to promote even closer economic ties .
asia ’ s boom is posing new questions about the importance of portraying the continent appropriately in the german media . the german public seems to have wide-ranging expectations of the media .
one student would like to understand the mentality of the asian people better , ” and another is “ particularly interested in japan , china , economics , and of course , politics ” , as she is reading asian studies .

for another , “ pakistan is probably the most topical subject , the situation around president musharraf .

while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .
asia is “ perceived as something great , something very interesting and , what is very important , it is perceived as the future - not only because of china with its growth in economic terms , but also because of culture , that ’ s very important , ” garcia-ziemsen said .
well-balanced reporting economic growth in asia has brought much attention to the region but to focus only on the boom would fail to meet the demands of german audiences , which want a complete , well-balanced portrayal of the continent , say media experts .

while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .
asia is “ perceived as something great , something very interesting and , what is very important , it is perceived as the future - not only because of china with its growth in economic terms , but also because of culture , that ’ s very important , ” garcia-ziemsen said .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.02.2008 britain to send students to auschwitz to learn about holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you get teenagers to connect with events that took place more than 60 years ago ?
the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .

a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .
" at least on the outside . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .

casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking .

since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .

the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.02.2008 tv casting show accused of damaging germany 's youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of german kids watched mark medlock win the last " dsds " series after the nervous breakdown of a 17-year-old , two german bodies concerned with the protection of young people have criticized broadcaster rtl for the way contestants are treated on the german version of pop idol . the german cultural council -lrb- kulturrat -rrb- accused rtl of displaying a " malicious disregard " for humanity on the talent show , commonly referred to as " dsds . "
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .

dw 's sanja blagojevic says that it 's now time for tadic to share some unpleasant truths with his people . serbia has sided with europe .
boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .
despite all fears , serbia in the end voted against the radicals and against an orientation towards russia . president tadic once again banked on the politically enlightened group of serbs , who are aware how dangerous the radicals are for the country .
his plan worked out and he won . but fear of radicals alone can not serve as a basis for politics in the long term .
serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .

truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.02.2008 britain to send students to auschwitz to learn about holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you get teenagers to connect with events that took place more than 60 years ago ?
the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .

several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "

it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .

a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .

no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .

in addition , they seized growing equipment such as heat lamps and an air pump for the plants . german states treat marijuana abuse with varying degrees of tolerance ; it is illegal everywhere in the country , but police often react to the smell of the drug only if , for instance , a driver is suspected of consuming it .
for the most part , german police are too stretched to control suspected plantations . " we have to see what the investigations reveal , " ulrich kaminski , press spokesman of the justice ministry in north-rhine westphalia told daily mindener tageblatt . police however have already opened a probe against the lawyer and the judge , who were traced from the grow shop 's customer lists .
experts examined a laptop to find out the extent of the drug racket .

the main aim of angela merkel ’ s visits to india and china last year was to promote even closer economic ties .
asia ’ s boom is posing new questions about the importance of portraying the continent appropriately in the german media . the german public seems to have wide-ranging expectations of the media .
one student would like to understand the mentality of the asian people better , ” and another is “ particularly interested in japan , china , economics , and of course , politics ” , as she is reading asian studies .
politics is also important to this passer-by , especially in “ afghanistan , the middle east – because i think that ’ s where it ’ s all going to play out in the next year . ”
for another , “ pakistan is probably the most topical subject , the situation around president musharraf .
and maybe also burma . ”
while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .
asia is “ perceived as something great , something very interesting and , what is very important , it is perceived as the future - not only because of china with its growth in economic terms , but also because of culture , that ’ s very important , ” garcia-ziemsen said .
well-balanced reporting economic growth in asia has brought much attention to the region but to focus only on the boom would fail to meet the demands of german audiences , which want a complete , well-balanced portrayal of the continent , say media experts .
“ we try to give as broad a picture so that people can learn more about asia - and from all perspectives , ” explained deputy editor michael kolz from the german phoenix documentary tv channel .
but how is the broader picture achieved ?
one of phoenix ’ s advantages is that it has a lot of air-time and the channel has been set up for the very purpose of providing as much information as possible , says kolz .
it even broadcasts entire press conferences and summits .

the main aim of angela merkel ’ s visits to india and china last year was to promote even closer economic ties .
asia ’ s boom is posing new questions about the importance of portraying the continent appropriately in the german media . the german public seems to have wide-ranging expectations of the media .
one student would like to understand the mentality of the asian people better , ” and another is “ particularly interested in japan , china , economics , and of course , politics ” , as she is reading asian studies .
politics is also important to this passer-by , especially in “ afghanistan , the middle east – because i think that ’ s where it ’ s all going to play out in the next year . ”
for another , “ pakistan is probably the most topical subject , the situation around president musharraf .
and maybe also burma . ”
while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .
asia is “ perceived as something great , something very interesting and , what is very important , it is perceived as the future - not only because of china with its growth in economic terms , but also because of culture , that ’ s very important , ” garcia-ziemsen said .
well-balanced reporting economic growth in asia has brought much attention to the region but to focus only on the boom would fail to meet the demands of german audiences , which want a complete , well-balanced portrayal of the continent , say media experts .
“ we try to give as broad a picture so that people can learn more about asia - and from all perspectives , ” explained deputy editor michael kolz from the german phoenix documentary tv channel .
but how is the broader picture achieved ?
one of phoenix ’ s advantages is that it has a lot of air-time and the channel has been set up for the very purpose of providing as much information as possible , says kolz .
it even broadcasts entire press conferences and summits .
but air-time is not everything - the german media will only be wholly successful if their ethos is to provide a wide variety of social , political and cultural themes from the entire asian continent . anna horakova send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic what does the german public want to know about asia ? china the chinese artist and civil rights activist ai weiwei was put under house arrest on friday .

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .
opponents fear the islamification of turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are concerned about sharia law the government has argued that the changes are a women 's rights issue but opponents fear that the moves are part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that the islamic-rooted government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ultimately seeks to impose sharia law .
on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .
the opposition republican people 's party has vowed to go to the constitutional court in an attempt to block the changes .
akp election result leads to headscarf debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish pm erdogan with his wife emine wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced .
rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu and german officials welcomed the outcome . pro-western boris tadic got a second term as serbia 's president on sunday , sparking celebrations on the streets of belgrade despite fears over kosovo 's looming independence . tadics opponent tomislav nikolic conceded defeat at a rally of his radical party in the serbian capital . tadic , who wants closer ties with the european union , had 51.1 percent of the vote against 47.2 percent for nikolic , a former ally of late serbian dictator slobodan milosevic and an ultra-nationalist who favors greater links to russia . with kosovo and serbia 's future direction inspiring the electorate , cesid , a belgrade-based election-monitoring organization , said the turnout of 6.7 million votes was 67.7 percent - the highest since milosevic was defeated in elections in 2000 . in the jan .
20 first round , nikolic came out in front with 40 percent of votes , against tadic 's 35 percent and experts had expected a very narrow runoff . germany offers assistance germany 's government welcomed tadic 's re-election . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin had noted " with pleasure " the outcome of the run-off poll . " the serbian people have stressed that they see the future of serbia within europe , " he said .
" that is good news for the whole of europe . " steg added that the german government was willing to support serbia on its road to europe , adding that a new cooperation agreement between the eu and serbia , expected to be signed on thursday , will help in that respect . " we trust that serbia will take the neccersary steps to move towards even closer ties with the eu , " he said . kosovo problem blocks eu aspirations the eu 's slovenian presidency also congratulated tadic on his victory , saying it reflected the country 's democratic resolve to join the bloc .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa said it was his " firm belief that serbia would very soon succeed in meeting the criteria required in order to proceed along this path . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian soldiers serving in kfor walk past the posters showing presidential candidate tomislav nikolic the eu made no mention of the other serbian issue high on its agenda - the expected declaration of independence from the breakaway republic of kosovo .
ethnic albanian leaders in the province have threatened to unilaterally declare independence within days of the election . both serbian presidential candidates had opposed independence , a move which is supported by the eu and the united states .
last week , the 27 eu nations finalized preparations for a civilian mission to help ease kosovo 's transition to independence .
it will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and judicial experts , one diplomat said . promise of a brighter future tadic used the promise of a brighter future in a serbia with strong links to the european union to motivate young voters to turn out in force . " everyone must go to vote today in the elections ...
we have a form of a referendum about the path serbia will take , " tadic said after casting his ballot in belgrade . " i expect voters will choose a continuation of the reforms started in october 2000 , " added the 50-year-old tadic , a trained psychologist . however , tadic failed to win the support of conservative nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica , who wanted him to take a tougher line against eu support for an independent kosovo . nikolic , a 55-year-old former undertaker , sought votes from kostunica 's camp , as well as from among the losers of serbia 's delayed transition from years of economic mismanagement under communism and the milosevic regime . nikolic : " russia is a closer partner " " serbia is close to the european union and russia , but at this time russia is a closer partner than the eu because it can make development possible for serbia , " he said after casting his vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic casts his ballot on sunday , feb .

dw 's sanja blagojevic says that it 's now time for tadic to share some unpleasant truths with his people . serbia has sided with europe .
boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .
despite all fears , serbia in the end voted against the radicals and against an orientation towards russia . president tadic once again banked on the politically enlightened group of serbs , who are aware how dangerous the radicals are for the country .
his plan worked out and he won . but fear of radicals alone can not serve as a basis for politics in the long term .
serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .
but kostunica 's tactic backfired . now , with victory in the bag , tadic could finally begin to talk about things that have long been avoided . he needs to tell serbians the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it is .
truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .
now they want to see that serbia 's path is really leading towards that goal . there 's much to do for the old and new president tadic .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "

13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .

but kostunica 's tactic backfired . now , with victory in the bag , tadic could finally begin to talk about things that have long been avoided . he needs to tell serbians the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it is .
truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .
now they want to see that serbia 's path is really leading towards that goal . there 's much to do for the old and new president tadic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.02.2008 tv casting show accused of damaging germany 's youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of german kids watched mark medlock win the last " dsds " series after the nervous breakdown of a 17-year-old , two german bodies concerned with the protection of young people have criticized broadcaster rtl for the way contestants are treated on the german version of pop idol . the german cultural council -lrb- kulturrat -rrb- accused rtl of displaying a " malicious disregard " for humanity on the talent show , commonly referred to as " dsds . "
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .

even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .

many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .

dw 's sanja blagojevic says that it 's now time for tadic to share some unpleasant truths with his people . serbia has sided with europe .
boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .
despite all fears , serbia in the end voted against the radicals and against an orientation towards russia . president tadic once again banked on the politically enlightened group of serbs , who are aware how dangerous the radicals are for the country .
his plan worked out and he won . but fear of radicals alone can not serve as a basis for politics in the long term .
serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .
but kostunica 's tactic backfired . now , with victory in the bag , tadic could finally begin to talk about things that have long been avoided . he needs to tell serbians the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it is .
truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .
now they want to see that serbia 's path is really leading towards that goal . there 's much to do for the old and new president tadic .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .

they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .

representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .

it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .

canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will number around 1,800 people , most of them police and judicial experts , one diplomat said . promise of a brighter future tadic used the promise of a brighter future in a serbia with strong links to the european union to motivate young voters to turn out in force . " everyone must go to vote today in the elections ...
we have a form of a referendum about the path serbia will take , " tadic said after casting his ballot in belgrade . " i expect voters will choose a continuation of the reforms started in october 2000 , " added the 50-year-old tadic , a trained psychologist . however , tadic failed to win the support of conservative nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica , who wanted him to take a tougher line against eu support for an independent kosovo . nikolic , a 55-year-old former undertaker , sought votes from kostunica 's camp , as well as from among the losers of serbia 's delayed transition from years of economic mismanagement under communism and the milosevic regime . nikolic : " russia is a closer partner " " serbia is close to the european union and russia , but at this time russia is a closer partner than the eu because it can make development possible for serbia , " he said after casting his vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic casts his ballot on sunday , feb .
3 in belgrade , a war-weary city so often at the crossroads of the region 's turbulent history , voters said they were torn between a future in the eu and losing kosovo . kosovo serbs also voted , some in the hope that their choice will help keep the province in serbia , others resigned to splitting from their motherland . leading up to the election , nato and the united nations bolstered troops and international police in kosovo . the un has run kosovo since nato 's 1999 air war drove out serb forces waging a crackdown on separatist albanians who comprise about 90 percent of the province 's 2 million population . most serbs consider the tiny territory the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christianity . dw staff -lrb- nda / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . the demand by us defense secretary robert gates for more troops has placed washington 's european partners in the alliance on the defensive , conference organizer horst teltschik said sunday .
some 350 high-caliber politicians and military leaders are due to take part in the three-day gathering , which will be opened with a speech by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohammed elbaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , will be joining in the talks , he said .
representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .
nato chief reiterates call for german troops scheffer again pressed germany to deploy combat troops in afghanistan after the country rejected a us call , bild newspaper said sunday .
" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .
but in my opinion the international forces need more of this elsewhere in afghanistan too , " he told the newspaper in an interview .
scheffer said he was trying to persuade a number of nations to play a bigger role in the battle against the taliban in southern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato wants to end the caveats which prevent combat involvement " i am trying to secure more flexibility from all nations with regard to deploying combat troops .
i take note of the fact that many nations have restrictions on sending troops into battle and i am trying to reduce these restrictions as far as possible , " he told the newspaper .
us goes public with demands pressure on germany to help fight a taliban onslaught grew last week when us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to his german counterpart demanding troops and helicopters .
it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .
nearly all of them are deployed in the capital kabul and the north as part of the nato-led international security assistance force , which comprises 42,000 troops from 39 countries .
german reluctance could spread through nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reconstruction and security role will remain commanders in afghanistan have called for around 7,500 extra troops to be deployed in the south and there are fears that germany 's reluctance could influence other countries ' decisions on their role in afghanistan .
canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .
a spokesman said scheffer was concerned that " very public calls " for more troops for afghanistan made it look as if allies lacked solidarity and would prefer nato to handle the issue " quietly .

more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .

representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .

" germany does a commendable job as the nation in command of forces in the north .

it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .

canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .
nato at the weekend signaled that it wanted to take the initiative on bringing member states to deploy more troops back from washington .

some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de language provides a hint about amnesiac 's identity police in heidelberg said they think they know where a man claiming to suffer from memory loss comes from .
the man , who calls himself " karl , " is probably from southern england .
but questions regarding who he is abound .

he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .

several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "

it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .

several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .

the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.02.2008 britain to send students to auschwitz to learn about holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you get teenagers to connect with events that took place more than 60 years ago ?
the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .

and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.02.2008 tv casting show accused of damaging germany 's youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of german kids watched mark medlock win the last " dsds " series after the nervous breakdown of a 17-year-old , two german bodies concerned with the protection of young people have criticized broadcaster rtl for the way contestants are treated on the german version of pop idol . the german cultural council -lrb- kulturrat -rrb- accused rtl of displaying a " malicious disregard " for humanity on the talent show , commonly referred to as " dsds . "
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .

serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .

truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .

dw 's sanja blagojevic says that it 's now time for tadic to share some unpleasant truths with his people . serbia has sided with europe .
boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .
despite all fears , serbia in the end voted against the radicals and against an orientation towards russia . president tadic once again banked on the politically enlightened group of serbs , who are aware how dangerous the radicals are for the country .
his plan worked out and he won . but fear of radicals alone can not serve as a basis for politics in the long term .
serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .
but kostunica 's tactic backfired . now , with victory in the bag , tadic could finally begin to talk about things that have long been avoided . he needs to tell serbians the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it is .
truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .
now they want to see that serbia 's path is really leading towards that goal . there 's much to do for the old and new president tadic .

in addition , they seized growing equipment such as heat lamps and an air pump for the plants . german states treat marijuana abuse with varying degrees of tolerance ; it is illegal everywhere in the country , but police often react to the smell of the drug only if , for instance , a driver is suspected of consuming it .
for the most part , german police are too stretched to control suspected plantations . " we have to see what the investigations reveal , " ulrich kaminski , press spokesman of the justice ministry in north-rhine westphalia told daily mindener tageblatt . police however have already opened a probe against the lawyer and the judge , who were traced from the grow shop 's customer lists .
experts examined a laptop to find out the extent of the drug racket .
they have already indicated that the legal duo was n't just producing cannabis for their own consumption but seemed to be supplementing their legal incomes with the lucrative plantation . it remains unclear whether the two legal eagles will defend themselves or hire lawyers in a case that is bound to grip the town 's local media . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's sanja blagojevic says that it 's now time for tadic to share some unpleasant truths with his people . serbia has sided with europe .
boris tadic , the democrat , might have only received a thin majority , but it 's a very important one .
despite all fears , serbia in the end voted against the radicals and against an orientation towards russia . president tadic once again banked on the politically enlightened group of serbs , who are aware how dangerous the radicals are for the country .
his plan worked out and he won . but fear of radicals alone can not serve as a basis for politics in the long term .
serbs , who are smart enough to figure things out , realize that the democrats do n't offer them much . since last may , they 've had a government that was formed out of fear of the radicals .
premier vojislav kostunica is a nationalist in democrat 's clothing , who did not want to stand up for his nationalism in public - until five days ago , when he refused to support tadic .
he gave the president 's pro-european stance as a reason .
but kostunica 's tactic backfired . now , with victory in the bag , tadic could finally begin to talk about things that have long been avoided . he needs to tell serbians the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it is .
truth no. 1 : kosovo will become independent , there 's no way around it .
truth no. 2 : serbs have conducted ethnic cleansings in croatia , bosnia and kosovo during the 1990s .
they did so , because they wanted a greater serbia and not because they wanted to protect innocent serbs living in these places .
this has to have consequences .
the past has to be examined .
war criminals have to be extradicted . tadic has to finally explain to people that they live in a small , poor and corrupt country , and that they - and not other countries that are often blamed for problems - carry responsibility for what happens in serbia . people need visible improvements , which above all means an improvement of their living conditions .
they need a perspective . the people have voted for europe .
now they want to see that serbia 's path is really leading towards that goal . there 's much to do for the old and new president tadic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 04.02.2008 confusion over mystery man 's identity continues in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " karl " has adjusted well to life in germany , even though he does not speak german " karl " says he is german and wants to remain in germany , but official documents say he is someone else who is british .
the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .

on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?

he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .

"
some 50 non-government organizations , including many women 's groups backed the protest , where representatives laid a wreath at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of the modern turkish republic , and sang the national anthem .
the turkish parliament is due to vote next week on changes to the constitution that will allow women to wear headscarves to universities .
the changes are expected to pass easily after the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- reached a deal with the far-right nationalist movement party last week .
opponents fear the islamification of turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are concerned about sharia law the government has argued that the changes are a women 's rights issue but opponents fear that the moves are part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that the islamic-rooted government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ultimately seeks to impose sharia law .
on saturday morning , foreign minister ali babacan said lifting the ban was a requirement for turkey joining the european union .
establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .
the opposition republican people 's party has vowed to go to the constitutional court in an attempt to block the changes .
akp election result leads to headscarf debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish pm erdogan with his wife emine wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced .
rather than take off their head-coverings , many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban .
the move to allow the islamic-style head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination for the presidency of abdullah gül , whose wife wears a headscarf . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
council member christian höppner added that the broadcaster is perpetrating " a level of media brutality and socio-political irresponsibility " that , as a member of rtl 's program advisory board , he can no longer accept .
in addition , germany 's state-sponsored commission for the protection of young people in the media -lrb- kjm -rrb- has opened a review procedure against the show .
the head of the kjm , wolf-dieter ring , said that the manner in which contestants are humiliated on the show could have detrimental effects on young viewers .
pop idol , german style germany 's version of britain 's " pop idol " or " american idol " in the us , dsds follows a tried-and-tested format .
casting calls are held in major german cities , and then the camera follows , documentary-style , as hordes of wanna-be pop stars are whittled down by a caustic jury to a select few finalists competing for a recording contract .
the early episodes of dsds typically focus on those unfortunate candidates who clearly do not have the stuff to become a pop star , nor the self-respect to prevent them from parading their lack of talent before rtl 's cameras and acid-tongued head juror , dieter bohlen of the 1980s pop duo " modern talking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter bohlen has become famous for his put-downs on " dsds " the latest incident to draw collective criticism involves a 17-year old boy whose nerves were so shattered by his audition - and bohlen 's scathing comments - that he hyperventilated and collapsed .
since his appearance on dsds , the boy , whose full name and home town were made public on the show , has received hundreds of hateful phone calls .
for his own security , his school has granted him leave .
during a recap of the incident on a subsequent dsds episode , bohlen blamed the boy 's father for failing to tell his son honestly that he has no singing talent .
" i find that deceitful and sanctimonious , after rtl handpicks the candidates , " kjm chairman ring said .
spreading like a cancer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : television should not " disturb " children as they develop into socially-adept beings , the kjm says ring added that it should be the goal of television not to disturb children during their development into socially-adept human beings .
the dsds jury , comprised of bohlen , anja lukaseder and andreas läsker , he said , portrays their " brutal selection " criteria as socially acceptable - something ring said he finds " problematic . "
the cultural council 's höppner went even further , saying that " delight in humiliation and unbridled voyeurism is spreading throughout different media platforms like a cancer " and can not fail to have social consequences .
höppner added that rtl does n't appear to want to address the problem , which is why he is calling on government and organizations to use their influence to stop this development .
rtl : " no need to protect candidates " rtl spokeswoman anke eickmeyer denied that dsds deliberately seeks to humiliate untalented candidates .
she told newsmagazine der spiegel that the people chosen to sing in front of the jury should be representative of the total number of candidates who come to the casting calls .
" among these are the talented singers , as well as the less talented singers , " eickmeyer said .
" all the contestants come to the casting of their own free will , with either a realistic or an unrealistic self-assessment of their talent , " she added .
" there is no general need to protect candidates . "
after talks with the kjm a year ago , rtl gave the impression that it would tread more carefully in future series of " deutschland sucht den superstar , " or " germany searches for a superstar . "
but if anything , as it kicks off its fifth season , the show appears to be less interested in spotting talent , and more interested in revelling in the cluelessness of some of its contestants , and the equally atrocious abuse spouted at them by bohlen & co .
rtl will have a chance to defend itself in front of a jury of kjm officials , but if the protectors of germany 's youth decide that the station has indeed committed a transgression , a fine could be levied . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 04.02.2008 german war children begin facing suppressed traumas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime childhood traumas are only beginning to affect germans now one quarter of germans were children during world war ii .
during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .

during the 1950s , researchers were still convinced that the generation had overcome the war traumas .
that 's not the case , according to recent studies . when hildgeard jost-berns hears a siren , she regularly winces .
while still working as a teacher , the 69-year-old had to disrupt her lessons when a practice alarm went off outside .
as a five-year-old , jost-berns saw how her parents ' apartment in the western german town of essen went up in flames after an air raid .
she was too young to understand why this was happening .
she was also too old to ever forget it .
years later , the flames still haunted her in her dreams . the loss of home and security always goes along with the loss of childhood .
that 's also what happened to beatrix wagner , who witnessed the attack on dresden in 1945 .
she can remember the crackling of the bombs and the scary helplessness of her mother . " it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .

" it was something completely unexpected and a horrible feeling , " wagner said . left alone with traumatic experiences no one was interested in the hurt feelings of a seven-year-old girl during the chaotic times of war .
bare survival was all that counted .
even after the war , wagner did n't get a chance to deal with her experiences .
psychologists taking care of traumatized children did n't exist .
a 1954 study also did away with any concerns about the psychological and physical well-being of these children and teenagers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut radebold " they were back to a normal weight , a normal height , normal school grades and had no serious psychological disorders as far as those could be detected with the methodology used at the time , " said hartmut radebold , a psychiatrist in kassel , who has studied the generation of war children for years . again and again , he noticed behavior among those 60 years and older that he attributes to war experiences that were never dealt with .
he noticed difficulties to form relationships , for example .
women from this generation find it difficult to open up to a partner .
many of them were raised by mothers and grandmothers alone - their fathers had either died in the war , were still missing or came home late after years as prisoners of war . what does n't kill me … but relationships were not the only way that traumas kept haunting the war children .
sirens or an uncomfortable lack of space inside a magnetic resonance tomography can bring back images and horrors from childhood . it 's a process that many find difficult to endure , as they see themselves as proud survivors , radebold said . " they live according to the saying : what does n't kill me , makes me stronger , " he said . that 's why they locked away their memories and let them simmer in their adult subconscious while going on with the professional and private lives .
in retirement , however , these suppressed memories start resurfacing in the absence of distractions offered by day-to-day jobs .
depression , panic attacks and physical ailments such as heart problems are often the result .
but many people ignore these signs as they 've learnt to ignore their body 's signals in times of hunger and cold . they still do that today and avoid medical checkups more frequently than others .
they do not take enough time to get over illnesses completely and have difficulties paying attention to their spiritual needs , including the need to mourn . hildegard jost-bens , for example , used to like a particular photograph of herself that shows her as an eight-year-old with bow-ties and curls . she 's changed her mind .
she 's realized that her face looks tense and serious . " and that 's despite the fact that the worst was over in 1946 , " she said .
" at least on the outside . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.02.2008 britain to send students to auschwitz to learn about holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you get teenagers to connect with events that took place more than 60 years ago ?
the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.
" it leaves a lasting impression . "
some years ago , the buchenwald concentration camp , near weimar , embarked on a unique project , cooperating with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
others say it 's time to view concentration camps and holocaust memorials in a broader light , one that reflects present-day realities .
" we should n't see these camps only in terms of guilt complexes and the dark past but also symbolic of the persecution of minorities and the brutalities that exist in parts of the world today , " said peter lautzas of the association of german history teachers . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .

about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .

the british government will sponsor student trips to the auschwitz concentration camp in an effort to keep the holocaust relevant for younger generations .
it 's an issue that germany is all too familiar with . underscoring the need to ensure that the lessons of the nazi genocide live on with a new generation , the british government extended a 2006 pilot program that funds day trips for two students from every secondary school in england to the death camp in present-day poland .
britain 's schools minister , jim knight said the scheme will now be made permanent with 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2 million euros -rrb- of government money a year until 2011 , and the possibility of more funding after that .
the idea behind the visit is for teenagers to educate their classmates on their return . historians estimate 1.1 million people died at the hands of poland 's german occupiers at auschwitz-birkenau between 1940 and 1945 , either from asphyxiation with zyklon b gas in the notorious gas chambers or from starvation , disease or exhaustion .
they included jews , roma , sinti , gays , disabled and blacks .
turning the educated into the educators " the holocaust was one of the most significant events in world history , " knight told the times .
" what strikes me is the sheer scale of it and how industrialized and mechanized the process of killing people became at auschwitz . "
" it was not hot-blooded brutality , it happened in a very planned way , with some people designing the process of death and others carrying it out , " knight said .
" every young person should have an understanding of this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped that students who visit auschwitz will educate their classmates about the holocaust the sixth-form students , who are typically between 16 and 18 years old , will meet with an auschwitz survivor , be shown around the camp 's barracks and gas chambers , see the piles of hair , shoes , clothes and other items seized by the nazis and hear first-hand accounts of life and death in the concentration camp .
they are to fly to poland and back in a day .
the government will shoulder the main financial cost of each student 's trip - 200 pounds per trip over the next three years while their schools must raise the remaining 100 pounds .
britain 's holocaust education trust , an influential group responsible for making the holocaust an integral part of the country 's national curriculum for history in 1991 , is to administer the program .
karen pollock , chief executive of the holocaust education trust , told the times the project aimed to turn the educated into educators .
" we are very aware that there 's going to be a time where there are n't any survivors left to go into schools , " pollock said .
" the young people on these visits themselves become eye witnesses .
for a lot of them , it 's life-changing .
they suddenly realize what they value and they see it as important to challenge prejudice today . "
pollock added that some students who had visited auschwitz within the framework of the program were inspired to distribute leaflets protesting against the far-right british national party candidates standing in their local council elections .
educating young germans a challenge sensitizing current and coming generations about the holocaust at a time when a generation of survivors is passing away presents a challenge to educators everywhere .
but nowhere is the problem more deeply felt than in germany , where the nazi genocide is usually dealt with intensively in secondary schools and visits to the many concentration camps and holocaust memorials across the country often form an integral part of history lessons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say german students are exhausted by the surfeit of teaching on the holocaust yet several studies in recent years show that germans born after reunification in 1990 know appallingly little about the holocaust .
a recent survey showed that while hitler is recognized by all , only one in three was aware of the meaning of the word , " holocaust . "
less than one in ten students could identify nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels .
many say that one of the most difficult challenges lies in educating young germans about 20th century history in a way that does n't alienate them or blame them in any way for the country 's dark past .
" the disinterest in history among today 's students is largely a psychological reflex because many feel the need to want to positively identify with germany , " henning küppers , a history teacher at a secondary school in stuttgart , told dw-world.de. a comic book to teach the holocaust efforts are already underway to replace the traditional teaching of the holocaust , which many critics say is often strenuously moralistic and ends up exhausting students , with more modern tools .
the berlin-based anne frank center said last week it planned to introduce a comic book covering key events of the nazi era in high schools in two german states as a way to educate young students about the past in a way they could relate to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an excerpt from the book on hitler 's speeches to the german masses " it 's important to find new approaches to telling the story of the holocaust in a way that connects with young people , " said thomas heppener , director of the center .
many holocaust memorials in recent years too have begun accommodating school groups by offering them a chance to stay overnight near the former camps or providing interactive aids to replace traditional tours in large groups .
most have recorded exhaustive interviews with holocaust survivors documenting daily life in the camps and created digital archives .
updating teaching methods horst seferens , press spokesman of the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg , which receives visits from school groups each day , said they had modernized their efforts to reach an entire generation of students who are no longer getting their information about the holocaust within their families who have few links to the event .
about four years ago , the camp put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenirs that buchenwald created some years ago " getting to know the biographies of former inmates remains the most effective way of getting students to empathize and understand what really happened during the holocaust , " seferens told dw-world.de.

4 , in versailles to approve a revision of the country 's constitution necessary for a ratification of the new eu reform treaty . the modifications were approved by a vote of 560 to 181 .
three-fifths of the 577 deputies from the national assembly and 330 senators had to vote in favor of the changes for them to become valid .
152 lawmakers abstained .
the vote paves the way for a ratification of the so-called lisbon treaty .
the french national assembly is expected to vote on thursday to adopt the treaty itself , followed by the senate and a final ratification by french president nicolas sarkozy .
no referendum this time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said " no " to the european constitution in 2005 french and dutch voters rejected a draft version of the european constitution earlier in 2005 , provoking a long period of uncertainty over reform of the bloc 's institutions .
the french president , however , campaigned strongly in favor of the new charter - a watered-down version of the failed constitution - and promised to have it passed by parliament , rather than run the risk of holding another referendum with an uncertain outcome .
for the treaty to be ratified , french lawmakers first had to agree on removing a now obsolete reference to the eu 's thwarted constitutional treaty , which had been injected into the french constitution before the 2005 referendum .
but a recent survey showed that a significant majority of french adults wanted a referendum on the treaty .
sovereignty of the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who demonstrated in versailles on monday felt that they were not given a voice in the eu debate opposition socialist deputies - while approving of the lisbon treaty itself - abstained from voting on the constitutional revision in protest of sarkozy 's decision not to open the vote to the people .
several hundred people protested in versailles on monday , demanding a new referendum .
" nicolas sarkozy thinks he is above the sovereignty of the people , " warned socialist deputy henri emmanuelli .
" this is going to end badly , " sarkozy 's ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , which has a majority in both houses , unreservedly backed the treaty .
ump spokesman yves jego said his party was " united , it is determined to ensure that europe moves forwards and that this text comes into force as soon as possible . "
after the big bang bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu reform treaty was signed in lisbon on dec .
13 , 2007 the lisbon treaty was designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners .
the treaty must be ratified in all 27 eu member states before it can come into force in 2009 , as planned .
also on monday , the romanian parliament almost unanimously ratified the eu reform treaty on the romanian news agency mediafax reported .
a total of 387 members of parliament and senators voted for the lisbon treaty , while one voted against and one abstained . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gates , us republican presidential candidate john mccain and russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov will be there along with the presidents of georgia , macedonia and moldova .
more than 40 foreign and defense ministers have pledged to attend the conference , the slogan of which is " a world in disarray - shifting powers - lack of strategies . " teltschik said the number of conflicts in the world was growing and the international community was becoming less certain of how to deal with them . international stability a priority for nato among the other topics under discussion will be the future of nato , the role china and japan can play in international stability , kosovo and russia 's relations with the west , teltschik said .

representing germany will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung , who on friday rejected gates ' request to send combat troops to fight the taliban and al qaeda in southern afghanistan . steinmeier said he would use the conference to press for a greater commitment to arms control and a dialogue along the lines of the conference on security and cooperation in europe that led to a significant reduction in cold war tensions in the mid-1970s .
" security is not created through the possession of weapons , but through the creation of trust as well , " the foreign minister told the german daily handelsblatt .

it was part of a us diplomatic offensive to shore up more support for the afghanistan mission amid fears that allies are abandoning a cornerstone of the us-led " war on terror . "
but defense minister jung on friday ruled out stationing soldiers in the south , saying the german mandate did not allow for sending troops into the turbulent region .
germany currently has about 3,100 troops stationed in afghanistan .

canada warned last week that it could withdraw its 2,500 troops if nato fails to send reinforcements to the south , a risk that appears heightened by germany 's stance .

the main aim of angela merkel ’ s visits to india and china last year was to promote even closer economic ties .
asia ’ s boom is posing new questions about the importance of portraying the continent appropriately in the german media . the german public seems to have wide-ranging expectations of the media .
one student would like to understand the mentality of the asian people better , ” and another is “ particularly interested in japan , china , economics , and of course , politics ” , as she is reading asian studies .
politics is also important to this passer-by , especially in “ afghanistan , the middle east – because i think that ’ s where it ’ s all going to play out in the next year . ”
for another , “ pakistan is probably the most topical subject , the situation around president musharraf .
and maybe also burma . ”
while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .
asia is “ perceived as something great , something very interesting and , what is very important , it is perceived as the future - not only because of china with its growth in economic terms , but also because of culture , that ’ s very important , ” garcia-ziemsen said .
well-balanced reporting economic growth in asia has brought much attention to the region but to focus only on the boom would fail to meet the demands of german audiences , which want a complete , well-balanced portrayal of the continent , say media experts .
“ we try to give as broad a picture so that people can learn more about asia - and from all perspectives , ” explained deputy editor michael kolz from the german phoenix documentary tv channel .
but how is the broader picture achieved ?
one of phoenix ’ s advantages is that it has a lot of air-time and the channel has been set up for the very purpose of providing as much information as possible , says kolz .
it even broadcasts entire press conferences and summits .
but air-time is not everything - the german media will only be wholly successful if their ethos is to provide a wide variety of social , political and cultural themes from the entire asian continent . anna horakova send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic what does the german public want to know about asia ? 9800 pakistan thomas baerthlein of the deutsche welle talks about the situation in flood-ravaged thatta the catastrophe click here to find out more about pakistan 's flood situation and relief work .

the main aim of angela merkel ’ s visits to india and china last year was to promote even closer economic ties .
asia ’ s boom is posing new questions about the importance of portraying the continent appropriately in the german media . the german public seems to have wide-ranging expectations of the media .
one student would like to understand the mentality of the asian people better , ” and another is “ particularly interested in japan , china , economics , and of course , politics ” , as she is reading asian studies .
politics is also important to this passer-by , especially in “ afghanistan , the middle east – because i think that ’ s where it ’ s all going to play out in the next year . ”
for another , “ pakistan is probably the most topical subject , the situation around president musharraf .

while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .
asia is “ perceived as something great , something very interesting and , what is very important , it is perceived as the future - not only because of china with its growth in economic terms , but also because of culture , that ’ s very important , ” garcia-ziemsen said .
well-balanced reporting economic growth in asia has brought much attention to the region but to focus only on the boom would fail to meet the demands of german audiences , which want a complete , well-balanced portrayal of the continent , say media experts .
“ we try to give as broad a picture so that people can learn more about asia - and from all perspectives , ” explained deputy editor michael kolz from the german phoenix documentary tv channel .

one of phoenix ’ s advantages is that it has a lot of air-time and the channel has been set up for the very purpose of providing as much information as possible , says kolz .

well-balanced reporting economic growth in asia has brought much attention to the region but to focus only on the boom would fail to meet the demands of german audiences , which want a complete , well-balanced portrayal of the continent , say media experts .
“ we try to give as broad a picture so that people can learn more about asia - and from all perspectives , ” explained deputy editor michael kolz from the german phoenix documentary tv channel .
but how is the broader picture achieved ?
one of phoenix ’ s advantages is that it has a lot of air-time and the channel has been set up for the very purpose of providing as much information as possible , says kolz .
it even broadcasts entire press conferences and summits .

the main aim of angela merkel ’ s visits to india and china last year was to promote even closer economic ties .
asia ’ s boom is posing new questions about the importance of portraying the continent appropriately in the german media . the german public seems to have wide-ranging expectations of the media .
one student would like to understand the mentality of the asian people better , ” and another is “ particularly interested in japan , china , economics , and of course , politics ” , as she is reading asian studies .
politics is also important to this passer-by , especially in “ afghanistan , the middle east – because i think that ’ s where it ’ s all going to play out in the next year . ”
for another , “ pakistan is probably the most topical subject , the situation around president musharraf .
and maybe also burma . ”
while politics and economics play an important role , there also seems to be a strong interest in asian culture , says deutsche welle ’ s cultural director , ramon garcia-ziemsen .

the problem is : who will pay for his social welfare benefits in germany ? he is about 5 feet 6 inches -lrb- 1.68 meters -rrb- , has a slight build , large blue eyes , prominent dark eyebrows and a balding pate with a shock of white hair that gives him the look of a mad professor . his manners are impeccably english - polite , deferential and well-spoken , not the posh upper class inflection of the british aristocracy , but standard broadcast speak . he says he is descended from royalty , but not from the house of windsor .
he insists that he is definitely not british as everyone assumes , but a blue-blooded german .
and his name is karl frankfurt . at the time of the 2006 soccer world cup in germany , he suddenly found himself at the mannheim train station without baggage and any form of identification .
he had lost his memory and went to the police for help .
" i must have had sunstroke , " he explained in an interview in his present domicile , a nursing home in the picturesque odenwald forest near heidelberg . the police , who had been on high alert because of the soccer games , were unsure about whether they were being conned and took him to a nearby psychiatric clinic in the small german town of wiesloch for evaluation . the case seemed to be genuine and photos of the " mystery man " were released to the press in germany and britain .
the investigation even went as far as america , but no one could identify him .
nobody had reported him missing either . my name is " karl " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of " karl " that was released to the press the german authorities need a name and date of birth to set up a file , so he told them he was " karl " .
he said he was born in frankfurt , so frankfurt became his surname .
they guessed that karl was about 60 years old . no one knows how he wound up at mannheim train station , and karl often deflects the question when asked about it , said ralf steigleder , resident director of the nursing home .
since october 2006 , karl has lived in odenwald and is well-liked by the staff and other residents , who communicate with him in english .
but if he is german , why does n't he speak the language ? karl seems a tad exasperated at the question .
he speaks 36 languages , among them several german dialects , but ca n't get access to all those languages stored somewhere in the recesses of his mind .
he says he 's lived all over the world and talks about his distinguished pedigree , which not only consists of german dukes and barons , but a french grandmother by the name of coco chanel . is his artwork a clue to the past ? his detailed drawings , watercolors and collages of sports cars and military aircraft , line the walls of his room , which is immaculately kept .
he keeps a diary and his penmanship is elegant , artistic even .
he says he designs cars and airplanes .
he joined the luftwaffe as a ten year old and flew the vickers vanguard turboprop jet .
" i 'm not lying , you know .
i 'll be happy to take a lie detector test , " he offers . perhaps something very english will jog the memory ?
does he enjoy eating marmite on buttered toast ? " english food is crap .
german food - i love it ! " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting of ferrari by karl , who knows a lot about cars steigleder said that karl lives in his own fantasy world . " there is no diagnosis for his condition , which is hard to define , " he said . " but he is happier than others who are not mentally ill .
he is well-adjusted and gets along with others , but tends to keep to himself , maybe because of the language barrier too . " a name and british passport record is found one thing is clear : karl likes germany and german food so much , he wants to stay .
but last september when the trail to uncover karl 's official identity went cold , a physician in scotland said he recognized karl , who used to be an outpatient at an edinburgh hospital by the name of norman henry mcmullan . the international police force interpol had matched up some fingerprints and the british passport office pulled up old records confirming that norman a.k.a.
karl was born in edinburgh and is indeed british . and now that could change everything . as european union citizens , britons have the automatic right to live in germany , but not to draw on social welfare entitlements from the german state , according to karl 's legal guardian , wolfgang wagner , who has filed an application for incapacity benefits on behalf of karl under an eu health scheme that is now pending . who will now pay for karl 's upkeep ? " now that we know for sure that karl is british , we might have a problem , " said wagner , who explained that if the uk work and pensions department declines to pay for karl 's upkeep in germany , he could be sent back to britain against his will .
on the other hand , had karl remained anonymous , the social services agency in the rhein-neckar region , where he lives , would have continued to provide for him indefinitely , added wagner . the cost of room and board at the nursing home is 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- monthly , an amount that does not include healthcare and other incidentals , said steigleder . besides , does knowing about karl 's past bring any benefits at all ?
moritz siebert , a german medical doctor and filmmaker in england , has recently completed a short documentary about karl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german food - i love it " siebert , who dug up some official records and questioned neighbors in karl 's childhood home , a working class district in edinburgh , knows this much about norman : he was an only child of parents who had died in the 1980s .
he had lived with his parents as an adult , but then moved to subsidized housing .
there is no record of norman having ever married in the uk .
his mother was a sales clerk and his father was a railway worker . the more one knows , the less one knows " neighbors recognized karl as the norman they knew , and said he was nice , but an oddball , " said siebert , who explained that one reason why karl might know so much about luxury cars is because he apparently used to work for some high rollers in casinos and nightclubs .
" the neighbors said he wore the uniform of a casino worker and drove around in a golden rolls royce .
but i find the more i ask about karl 's past , the less i know about him . " the memory karl has of his own past is not the past that we know , " said siebert , who had also spent time with karl in odenwald , where he is known as herr frankfurt to the locals . " i hope the officials can find a solution for karl to remain in germany , " he said .
" it should not be up to the authorities to define who he is , but for him to define himself . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- q & a : serbia presidential election bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 07:48 gmt , monday , 4 february 2008 q & a : serbia presidential election serbia 's pro-western president boris tadic has won re-election , beating his nationalist rival tomislav nikolic in a run-off vote .
mr tadic won 51 % of the vote in the second round on sunday , against mr nikolic 's 47 % , the electoral commission said .
mr nikolic had narrowly won the first round two weeks ago .
the election came at a sensitive time , with the un-administered serbian province of kosovo preparing to declare independence .
q : where do the two rivals stand politically ?
boris tadic is the current president and leader of the democratic party .
he has pledged to continue serbia 's pro-western orientation and free market reforms .
his support comes from the g17 plus group and three muslim minority parties .
he campaigned under the slogan " both kosovo and the eu " , arguing kosovo should remain in serbia , and serbia should join the eu .
tomislav nikolic is deputy leader of the hardline nationalist serbian radical party .
he was standing in for the party 's official leader , vojislav seselj , who is still on trial in the hague , accused of war crimes .
it was mr nikolic 's fourth attempt to win the presidency .
in 2004 , he made it to the second round , only to lose to boris tadic .
mr nikolic has recently toned down his rhetoric but is on the record for saying that if the new government " peacefully accepts " kosovo 's independence his party would not " sit calmly and wait " .
seven other candidates were eliminated in the first round .
q : what were the main issues ?
kosovo 's future and eu accession talks were major issues in the poll .
but bread-and-butter issues such as unemployment and improving living standards also figured prominently in the campaign .
q : why is kosovo such an important issue ?
mr tadic now faces the prospect of kosovo becoming independent .
he is not keen to go down in history as the president who gave up the province considered by many serbs as the cradle of their culture , religion and national identity .
both mr tadic and mr nikolic voiced their strong opposition to any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian population .
q : where do the candidates stand on the eu ?
mr tadic advocates closer ties with the eu , while mr nikolic is in favour of closer ties with russia and china .
eu leaders meeting in brussels in december offered to accelerate serbia 's membership negotiations , but only after belgrade hands over war crime fugitives still at large .
in the past , mr tadic has pledged to find and arrest war crime suspects such as radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , while mr nikolic has let it be known that the fugitives would no longer have to live in fear of arrest if he came to power .
q : how does the system work ?
the president is elected for a five-year term and can not serve more than two terms .
nearly 6.7m voters are registered in serbia , along with 107,000 serbs living in kosovo .
they were able to cast their ballots at more than 8,000 polling stations .
just over 37,000 serbs living abroad were also eligible .
q : what are the presidential powers ?
the role of president is largely ceremonial , but it does carry enormous symbolic influence and the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaux abroad .

mr tadic won 51 % of the vote in the second round on sunday , against mr nikolic 's 47 % , the electoral commission said .
mr nikolic had narrowly won the first round two weeks ago .
the election came at a sensitive time , with the un-administered serbian province of kosovo preparing to declare independence .
q : where do the two rivals stand politically ?
boris tadic is the current president and leader of the democratic party .
he has pledged to continue serbia 's pro-western orientation and free market reforms .
his support comes from the g17 plus group and three muslim minority parties .
he campaigned under the slogan " both kosovo and the eu " , arguing kosovo should remain in serbia , and serbia should join the eu .
tomislav nikolic is deputy leader of the hardline nationalist serbian radical party .
he was standing in for the party 's official leader , vojislav seselj , who is still on trial in the hague , accused of war crimes .
it was mr nikolic 's fourth attempt to win the presidency .
in 2004 , he made it to the second round , only to lose to boris tadic .
mr nikolic has recently toned down his rhetoric but is on the record for saying that if the new government " peacefully accepts " kosovo 's independence his party would not " sit calmly and wait " .
seven other candidates were eliminated in the first round .
q : what were the main issues ?
kosovo 's future and eu accession talks were major issues in the poll .
but bread-and-butter issues such as unemployment and improving living standards also figured prominently in the campaign .
q : why is kosovo such an important issue ?
mr tadic now faces the prospect of kosovo becoming independent .
he is not keen to go down in history as the president who gave up the province considered by many serbs as the cradle of their culture , religion and national identity .
both mr tadic and mr nikolic voiced their strong opposition to any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian population .
q : where do the candidates stand on the eu ?
mr tadic advocates closer ties with the eu , while mr nikolic is in favour of closer ties with russia and china .
eu leaders meeting in brussels in december offered to accelerate serbia 's membership negotiations , but only after belgrade hands over war crime fugitives still at large .
in the past , mr tadic has pledged to find and arrest war crime suspects such as radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , while mr nikolic has let it be known that the fugitives would no longer have to live in fear of arrest if he came to power .
q : how does the system work ?
the president is elected for a five-year term and can not serve more than two terms .
nearly 6.7m voters are registered in serbia , along with 107,000 serbs living in kosovo .
they were able to cast their ballots at more than 8,000 polling stations .
just over 37,000 serbs living abroad were also eligible .
q : what are the presidential powers ?
the role of president is largely ceremonial , but it does carry enormous symbolic influence and the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaux abroad .

" someone screamed and the crowd went wild .
this was the start everyone in abuja 's ibiza garden wanted .
yakubu stroked in the ball from the spot .
a first goal handed to the super eagles on a plate .
the defeat is hard to bear for nigerians guys leapt up and threw themselves into a makossa dance , bending themselves double and flailing their hands about .
a fountain of beer sprayed over the crowd .
it was a relief from the tension of the scrappy , slow start .
" we 'll beat the black stars into the white stars tonight ! " one man said as he slumped into his seat and wrapped a hand around a big green bottle of star beer .
but 30-year-old ike was n't so sure .
" actually i fear for nigeria , ghana has got some good firepower .
last friendly they beat us like babies , but you have to be patriotic , so nigeria are going to win i think . "
high expectations most people seem to think nigerian football is in a mess .
before the tournament , expectations of the super eagles were super-charged .
their chances of getting to the final were rated high .
i 'm happy because black stars have won and people will keep buying my t-shirts ghanaian trader grace ghanaians go wild then came a shuddering defeat in their opening game against ivory coast , and a shameful draw against mali .
fans were roused again by the drubbing the nigerians handed out to the benin side midweek .
but 20 minutes after kick-off , fists were pumping in frustration as nigeria lost possession too easily for the crowd 's liking .
a michael essien shot from outside the area silenced everyone , even though it sailed well wide .
hopes were high after nigeria went ahead minutes later yakubu seemed to be through on goal , and everyone leaped to their feet , but then the hands were thrown down again in frustration as he limply passed it to the ghanaian keeper .
" that na be foul ! " appealed one man to the tv screen .
minutes later he got his wish .
yakubu was pulled down in the area .
short celebration the party lasted all of 10 minutes .
stony-faced they watched michael essien rise to meet a header and equalise on the stroke of half time .
nigeria let slip their lead and frustrations grew for fans " we 're playing the referee , " said nonso omwuamibe at half time .
" most times when nigeria is playing and it 's a northern african referee we ca n't win . "
the second half seemed to be all ghana , despite captain john mensah 's sending off .
people 's attention stated to turn to picking over the bones already .
" midfield dey shun dem ! " complained one fan to his friend , " make am get up and support the strikers ! "
" attack-o ! " screamed another .
recrimination nigerian players were falling all over the place .
mikel obi was holding his eye at one point .
tackle came after clattering tackle , and despair began to settle in .
even before ghana scored the winner , one man dropped to his knees to plead with the tv screen .
when the scrappy goal went in , some fans had just about had enough .
several stood up and left in disgust .
they missed one of the most thrilling endings in the competition so far .
outside several fights broke out between guys pumped up with booze .

the quad-core chip , known as tukwila , is designed for high-end servers rather than personal computers .
it operates at speeds of up to 2ghz , the equivalent of a standard pc chip .
it marks the latest milestone in chip technology ; intel released the first processor to contain more than one billion transistors in 2006 .
" it 's not revolutionary , it 's another evolutionary step , " said malcolm penn , an analyst at future horizons , of tukwila .
memory machine the chip industry is driven by moore 's law , originally articulated by intel co-founder gordon moore in 1965 .
the industry axiom states that the number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again in 2004 , the equivalent processor to tukwila contained 592 million of the tiny switches .
although the new chip packs more than 2 billion transistors it operates at a relatively modest speed of 2ghz , the equivalent of many pc chips .
last year ibm released what was described as the " world 's fastest commercial chip " that operates at 4.7ghz.
the dual-core power6 processor contains just 790 million transistors .
a large number of the transistors on the new intel chip are used for memory .
" -lsb- it -rsb- contains lots of onboard memory and registers which are just a very efficient computer architecture to process data faster , " said mr penn .
cache memory holds data to be processed by the chip .
the closer it is to the processor , the quicker the data can be crunched .
" it 's like the difference between getting food from the fridge , rather than from the corner shop , " said mr penn .
" the very early microprocessors had no cache memory onboard - it was all off chip - and now they have as much as they can fit on within the chip size limitation , " he said .
mr penn .
" that 's an ongoing trend . "
tiny technology the chip also bucks the trend seen in many modern processors of aiming for lower power consumption .
" that 's very much a reflection of the market place demands , " said justin ratner , chief technology officer of the firm .
he said that firms that used the chips demanded more performance and were willing to trade power to get it .
" these chips go into a quite a unique market place , " he said .
the firm will also show off a chip designed for ultra-mobile devices , known as silverthorne .
the processor is based on the firms latest transistor technology which contains features just 45 nanometres -lrb- billionth of a metre -rrb- wide .
tukwila is based on 65 nanometre technology .
" -lsb- using 65nm technology -rsb- reflects the design time involved in that processor , " mr ratner told bbc news .
both chips will be shown off at the international solid state circuits conference -lrb- isscc -rrb- in san francisco .

" -lsb- it -rsb- contains lots of onboard memory and registers which are just a very efficient computer architecture to process data faster , " said mr penn .
cache memory holds data to be processed by the chip .
the closer it is to the processor , the quicker the data can be crunched .
" it 's like the difference between getting food from the fridge , rather than from the corner shop , " said mr penn .

mr penn .

tiny technology the chip also bucks the trend seen in many modern processors of aiming for lower power consumption .
" that 's very much a reflection of the market place demands , " said justin ratner , chief technology officer of the firm .
he said that firms that used the chips demanded more performance and were willing to trade power to get it .
" these chips go into a quite a unique market place , " he said .
the firm will also show off a chip designed for ultra-mobile devices , known as silverthorne .
the processor is based on the firms latest transistor technology which contains features just 45 nanometres -lrb- billionth of a metre -rrb- wide .

the quad-core chip , known as tukwila , is designed for high-end servers rather than personal computers .
it operates at speeds of up to 2ghz , the equivalent of a standard pc chip .
it marks the latest milestone in chip technology ; intel released the first processor to contain more than one billion transistors in 2006 .

memory machine the chip industry is driven by moore 's law , originally articulated by intel co-founder gordon moore in 1965 .
the industry axiom states that the number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again in 2004 , the equivalent processor to tukwila contained 592 million of the tiny switches .

the quad-core chip , known as tukwila , is designed for high-end servers rather than personal computers .
it operates at speeds of up to 2ghz , the equivalent of a standard pc chip .
it marks the latest milestone in chip technology ; intel released the first processor to contain more than one billion transistors in 2006 .
" it 's not revolutionary , it 's another evolutionary step , " said malcolm penn , an analyst at future horizons , of tukwila .
memory machine the chip industry is driven by moore 's law , originally articulated by intel co-founder gordon moore in 1965 .
the industry axiom states that the number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again in 2004 , the equivalent processor to tukwila contained 592 million of the tiny switches .
although the new chip packs more than 2 billion transistors it operates at a relatively modest speed of 2ghz , the equivalent of many pc chips .
last year ibm released what was described as the " world 's fastest commercial chip " that operates at 4.7ghz.
the dual-core power6 processor contains just 790 million transistors .
a large number of the transistors on the new intel chip are used for memory .
" -lsb- it -rsb- contains lots of onboard memory and registers which are just a very efficient computer architecture to process data faster , " said mr penn .
cache memory holds data to be processed by the chip .
the closer it is to the processor , the quicker the data can be crunched .
" it 's like the difference between getting food from the fridge , rather than from the corner shop , " said mr penn .
" the very early microprocessors had no cache memory onboard - it was all off chip - and now they have as much as they can fit on within the chip size limitation , " he said .
mr penn .
" that 's an ongoing trend . "
tiny technology the chip also bucks the trend seen in many modern processors of aiming for lower power consumption .
" that 's very much a reflection of the market place demands , " said justin ratner , chief technology officer of the firm .
he said that firms that used the chips demanded more performance and were willing to trade power to get it .
" these chips go into a quite a unique market place , " he said .
the firm will also show off a chip designed for ultra-mobile devices , known as silverthorne .
the processor is based on the firms latest transistor technology which contains features just 45 nanometres -lrb- billionth of a metre -rrb- wide .
tukwila is based on 65 nanometre technology .
" -lsb- using 65nm technology -rsb- reflects the design time involved in that processor , " mr ratner told bbc news .

the falcon cable , owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable , led to a " critical " telecom breakdown , according to one local official .
the cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed , said owner flag telecom .
the earlier break disrupted service in egypt , the middle east and india .
" the situation is critical for us in terms of congestion , " omar sultan , chief executive of dubai 's isp du , told the associated press , following the most recent break .
wednesday 's incident caused disruption to 70 % of the nationwide internet network in egypt on wednesday , while india suffered up to 60 % disruption .
flag telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from alexandria in egypt - on 5 february , with repair work expected to take a week .
a repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the " next few days " , the firm said .
web returns the first cable - the fiber-optic link around the globe -lrb- flag -rrb- - was cut at 0800 on 30 january , the firm said .
inside a submarine cable 1 polyethylene cover 2,4 stranded steel armour wires 3,5 tar-soaked nylon yarn 6 polycarbonate insulator 7 copper sheath 8 protective core 9 optical fibres not to scale a second cable thought to lie alongside it - sea-me-we 4 , or the south east asia-middle east-west europe 4 cable - was also split .
flag is a 28,000km -lrb- 17,400 mile -rrb- long submarine communications cable that links australia and japan with europe via india and the middle east .
sea-me-we 4 is a submarine cable linking south east asia to europe via the indian subcontinent and the middle east .
the two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting europe to the middle east via egypt was the older sea-m-we 3 system , according to research firm telegeography .
the firm said the cuts reduced the amount of available capacity on the stretch of network between india and europe by 75 % percent .
as a result , carriers in egypt and the middle east re-routed their european traffic around the globe , through south east asia and across the pacific and atlantic oceans .
the cause of the break has still not been confirmed .
initial reports suggested that it could have been snapped by a ship 's anchor .
but egypt 's communications ministry said damage to the cables in the mediterranean was not caused by ships .
the transport ministry said that footage recorded by onshore video cameras of the location of the cables showed no maritime traffic in the area when the cables were damaged .
" the ministry 's maritime transport committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area , " a statement said .
internet service providers said they expected india 's to be back to about 80 % of its usual speed by the end of friday .
in egypt minister of communications and information technology tarek kamil said he expected to be at the same capacity within two days .
" however , it 's not before ten days until the internet service returns to its normal performance , " kamil told the state al-ahram newspaper .

the falcon cable , owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable , led to a " critical " telecom breakdown , according to one local official .
the cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed , said owner flag telecom .
the earlier break disrupted service in egypt , the middle east and india .
" the situation is critical for us in terms of congestion , " omar sultan , chief executive of dubai 's isp du , told the associated press , following the most recent break .
wednesday 's incident caused disruption to 70 % of the nationwide internet network in egypt on wednesday , while india suffered up to 60 % disruption .
flag telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from alexandria in egypt - on 5 february , with repair work expected to take a week .
a repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the " next few days " , the firm said .
web returns the first cable - the fiber-optic link around the globe -lrb- flag -rrb- - was cut at 0800 on 30 january , the firm said .

flag is a 28,000km -lrb- 17,400 mile -rrb- long submarine communications cable that links australia and japan with europe via india and the middle east .
sea-me-we 4 is a submarine cable linking south east asia to europe via the indian subcontinent and the middle east .
the two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting europe to the middle east via egypt was the older sea-m-we 3 system , according to research firm telegeography .
the firm said the cuts reduced the amount of available capacity on the stretch of network between india and europe by 75 % percent .
as a result , carriers in egypt and the middle east re-routed their european traffic around the globe , through south east asia and across the pacific and atlantic oceans .
the cause of the break has still not been confirmed .
initial reports suggested that it could have been snapped by a ship 's anchor .
but egypt 's communications ministry said damage to the cables in the mediterranean was not caused by ships .
the transport ministry said that footage recorded by onshore video cameras of the location of the cables showed no maritime traffic in the area when the cables were damaged .
" the ministry 's maritime transport committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area , " a statement said .
internet service providers said they expected india 's to be back to about 80 % of its usual speed by the end of friday .
in egypt minister of communications and information technology tarek kamil said he expected to be at the same capacity within two days .

the falcon cable , owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable , led to a " critical " telecom breakdown , according to one local official .
the cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed , said owner flag telecom .
the earlier break disrupted service in egypt , the middle east and india .
" the situation is critical for us in terms of congestion , " omar sultan , chief executive of dubai 's isp du , told the associated press , following the most recent break .
wednesday 's incident caused disruption to 70 % of the nationwide internet network in egypt on wednesday , while india suffered up to 60 % disruption .
flag telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from alexandria in egypt - on 5 february , with repair work expected to take a week .
a repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the " next few days " , the firm said .
web returns the first cable - the fiber-optic link around the globe -lrb- flag -rrb- - was cut at 0800 on 30 january , the firm said .
inside a submarine cable 1 polyethylene cover 2,4 stranded steel armour wires 3,5 tar-soaked nylon yarn 6 polycarbonate insulator 7 copper sheath 8 protective core 9 optical fibres not to scale a second cable thought to lie alongside it - sea-me-we 4 , or the south east asia-middle east-west europe 4 cable - was also split .
flag is a 28,000km -lrb- 17,400 mile -rrb- long submarine communications cable that links australia and japan with europe via india and the middle east .
sea-me-we 4 is a submarine cable linking south east asia to europe via the indian subcontinent and the middle east .
the two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting europe to the middle east via egypt was the older sea-m-we 3 system , according to research firm telegeography .
the firm said the cuts reduced the amount of available capacity on the stretch of network between india and europe by 75 % percent .
as a result , carriers in egypt and the middle east re-routed their european traffic around the globe , through south east asia and across the pacific and atlantic oceans .
the cause of the break has still not been confirmed .
initial reports suggested that it could have been snapped by a ship 's anchor .
but egypt 's communications ministry said damage to the cables in the mediterranean was not caused by ships .
the transport ministry said that footage recorded by onshore video cameras of the location of the cables showed no maritime traffic in the area when the cables were damaged .
" the ministry 's maritime transport committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area , " a statement said .
internet service providers said they expected india 's to be back to about 80 % of its usual speed by the end of friday .
in egypt minister of communications and information technology tarek kamil said he expected to be at the same capacity within two days .
" however , it 's not before ten days until the internet service returns to its normal performance , " kamil told the state al-ahram newspaper .
