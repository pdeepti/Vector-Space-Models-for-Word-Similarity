the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .
the state of innocence thus suggested is soon over : the holy ritual of transubstantiation is followed by a seduction scene and images of world war i , with soldiers gently swaying to wagner 's delicate string sounds as though at the oktoberfest . the dark moments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihoko fujimura was convincing as kundry it 's clear that this retrospective of german history can not exclude its darkest era .
kundry appears to parsifal in act two in a curly blonde wig under a top hat à la marlene dietrich .
the evil sorcerer klingsor is in high heels , black lace stockings and garters reminiscent of the " rocky horror picture show . " after kundry 's kiss in act two , red flags with black swastikas - in present-day germany , an illegal symbol - are suspended full-length on the set , and nazi soldiers occupy the scene .
when parsifal takes the holy speer , that disturbing scenario is dispelled , the reichs-eagle crashes to the floor and shatters into bits . act three takes the viewer to the bombed-out ruins of wahnfried .
after the good friday music , the scene is transformed to the bundestag , modern germany 's parliament , and amfortas , leader of the grail knights , is the chancellor .
but even that scene is superseded in a hopeful vision of the future : a gigantic globe magnifies the lush red light of the grail , then turns to reflect the audience in the festspielhaus itself . making music visual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner wanted to create a " total work of art " in this reporter 's nineteen-year history of visiting the bayreuth festival , this was the first time that a stage director was not booed at the premiere .
with so much food for thought , a term by richard wagner came to mind : the goal of his " total work of art " was to be " make music visual . "
although there were moments where it seemed that conductor daniele gatti - giving his bayreuth debut - had compromised to accommodate the elaborate stage machinations , the musical experience was in fact made more satisfying , not less , through the array of concepts and images served up by stefan herheim . not least of all , it was a superb cast , with all protagonists demonstrating robust vocal strength and clear articulation .
they included korean baritone kwangchul youn as gurnemanz and japanese mezzo-soprano mihoko fujimura as kundry .
there was also a strong debut by german baritone detlev roth as amfortas and the first truly satisfying parsifal heard here in a very long time : british tenor christopher ventris , also giving his bayreuth debut . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is part of the job of a united states president to establish effective relations with our allies , obama told reporters in london after meeting british prime minister gordon brown . answering a reporter who had asked him to respond to republican accusations that the had embarked on a " victory lap " abroad , obama pointed out it was republican candidate john mccain who had advised him to travel abroad and visit iraq and afghanistan . the democrat argued his tour had been important , because he was " convinced " america was facing problems " at home " which could not be solved " without strong partners " abroad , obama said . bildunterschrift : obama and brown take a walk in london on sunday republicans however branded his overseas tour a shallow political stunt .
rival john mccain accused him of speaking to the " people of the world " and not americans . opinion polls showed that if anything , the race narrowed between obama and mccain during his nine-day absence .
that was despite mccain 's struggle to get media coverage during his opponent 's trip . talks with brown obama described his conversation with brown as " terrific . "
his talks in london are the final stage of a trip aimed at enhancing his foreign affairs image , which had led him also to iraq , afghanistan , israel , the palestinian areas , berlin and paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama outside number 10 downing street at downing street 10 , he reiterated his call for increasing the number of us troops in afghanistan as well as for stronger contributions by european allies .
those stronger numbers were needed to win the conflict in afghanistan and build the country , he said . the illinois senator noted the traditionally exceptionally strong ties between great britain and the us .

" it is part of the job of a united states president to establish effective relations with our allies , obama told reporters in london after meeting british prime minister gordon brown . answering a reporter who had asked him to respond to republican accusations that the had embarked on a " victory lap " abroad , obama pointed out it was republican candidate john mccain who had advised him to travel abroad and visit iraq and afghanistan . the democrat argued his tour had been important , because he was " convinced " america was facing problems " at home " which could not be solved " without strong partners " abroad , obama said . bildunterschrift : obama and brown take a walk in london on sunday republicans however branded his overseas tour a shallow political stunt .
rival john mccain accused him of speaking to the " people of the world " and not americans . opinion polls showed that if anything , the race narrowed between obama and mccain during his nine-day absence .
that was despite mccain 's struggle to get media coverage during his opponent 's trip . talks with brown obama described his conversation with brown as " terrific . "
his talks in london are the final stage of a trip aimed at enhancing his foreign affairs image , which had led him also to iraq , afghanistan , israel , the palestinian areas , berlin and paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama outside number 10 downing street at downing street 10 , he reiterated his call for increasing the number of us troops in afghanistan as well as for stronger contributions by european allies .
those stronger numbers were needed to win the conflict in afghanistan and build the country , he said . the illinois senator noted the traditionally exceptionally strong ties between great britain and the us .
" i think there is a deep and abiding affection for the british people in america and a fascination with all things british .
that 's not going to go away any time soon , " he said .
he was answering a question about his more public appearances in berlin and paris . in berlin thursday , obama had made a 30-minute foreign policy address to an enthusiastic crowd of some 200,000 in the city center . low key his london visit by contrast was low key , and unlike in berlin and in paris , where he had had talks with french president nicolas sarkozy friday , obama only answered journalists ' questions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama talks with britain 's conservative party leader david cameron observers said there was a desire in britain not to seem to favor either obama or his republican party presidential challenger john mccain , who visited britain last march . deviating from the protocol , and to the surprise of tourists and londoners , obama and brown took a stroll down cordoned-off downing street .
onlookers , who were nonetheless held at a distance by security forces , were able to photograph the two politicians on the nearby parade ground . obama had earlier saturday morning held a breakfast meeting at his london hotel with former british prime minister tony blair , now the special middle east envoy for the international mediating bloc of the us , united nations , russia and european union .
their talks focused principally on the middle east , but also on blair 's work on climate change , a spokesman said . the illinois senator also met brown 's predecessor tony blair , now the international community 's middle east envoy , and opposition conservative party leader david cameron and left for chicago later saturday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .
the state of innocence thus suggested is soon over : the holy ritual of transubstantiation is followed by a seduction scene and images of world war i , with soldiers gently swaying to wagner 's delicate string sounds as though at the oktoberfest . the dark moments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihoko fujimura was convincing as kundry it 's clear that this retrospective of german history can not exclude its darkest era .
kundry appears to parsifal in act two in a curly blonde wig under a top hat à la marlene dietrich .
the evil sorcerer klingsor is in high heels , black lace stockings and garters reminiscent of the " rocky horror picture show . " after kundry 's kiss in act two , red flags with black swastikas - in present-day germany , an illegal symbol - are suspended full-length on the set , and nazi soldiers occupy the scene .
when parsifal takes the holy speer , that disturbing scenario is dispelled , the reichs-eagle crashes to the floor and shatters into bits . act three takes the viewer to the bombed-out ruins of wahnfried .
after the good friday music , the scene is transformed to the bundestag , modern germany 's parliament , and amfortas , leader of the grail knights , is the chancellor .
but even that scene is superseded in a hopeful vision of the future : a gigantic globe magnifies the lush red light of the grail , then turns to reflect the audience in the festspielhaus itself . making music visual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner wanted to create a " total work of art " in this reporter 's nineteen-year history of visiting the bayreuth festival , this was the first time that a stage director was not booed at the premiere .
with so much food for thought , a term by richard wagner came to mind : the goal of his " total work of art " was to be " make music visual . "
although there were moments where it seemed that conductor daniele gatti - giving his bayreuth debut - had compromised to accommodate the elaborate stage machinations , the musical experience was in fact made more satisfying , not less , through the array of concepts and images served up by stefan herheim . not least of all , it was a superb cast , with all protagonists demonstrating robust vocal strength and clear articulation .
they included korean baritone kwangchul youn as gurnemanz and japanese mezzo-soprano mihoko fujimura as kundry .
there was also a strong debut by german baritone detlev roth as amfortas and the first truly satisfying parsifal heard here in a very long time : british tenor christopher ventris , also giving his bayreuth debut . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the daily la repubblica , interior minister roberto maroni plans to build new intake centers throughout the country .
according to the interior ministry , over 10,600 boat people arrived in italy in the first half of 2008 , nearly twice as many as the 5,378 that came in the same period in 2007 .
the italian government called a state of emergency with a wave of refugees in 2002 .
that state of emergency was renewed annually - even under the center-left government of romano prodi .
because intake centers in february 2008 seemed sufficient , the prodi government limited the state of emergency to the three southern regions of calabria , sicily and puglia .

in response , maroni criticized what he claimed was the opposition intention to make the state of emergency seem like an entirely new development , and called the opposition position " the worst italian politics . "
the interior minister is to face parliament on tuesday .
berlusconi 's priority berlusconi , who was elected prime minister in april , had declared the fight against illegal immigration a priority .
a first step was the passage this week of a package of new security laws brought forward by the conservative government .

according to the daily la repubblica , interior minister roberto maroni plans to build new intake centers throughout the country .
according to the interior ministry , over 10,600 boat people arrived in italy in the first half of 2008 , nearly twice as many as the 5,378 that came in the same period in 2007 .
the italian government called a state of emergency with a wave of refugees in 2002 .
that state of emergency was renewed annually - even under the center-left government of romano prodi .
because intake centers in february 2008 seemed sufficient , the prodi government limited the state of emergency to the three southern regions of calabria , sicily and puglia .
the berlusconi government at the behest of the interior ministry has now widened the powers to the entire country .
lambasted by the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi wants to curb illegal immigration warning of the introduction of a " police state , " the country 's opposition attacked the measures sharply , calling them abhorrent .
" italy does not need inhuman and extraordinary measures , " said parliamentarian rocco buttiglione , according to a report by the turin-based daily la stampa on saturday .
in response , maroni criticized what he claimed was the opposition intention to make the state of emergency seem like an entirely new development , and called the opposition position " the worst italian politics . "
the interior minister is to face parliament on tuesday .
berlusconi 's priority berlusconi , who was elected prime minister in april , had declared the fight against illegal immigration a priority .
a first step was the passage this week of a package of new security laws brought forward by the conservative government .
the number of illegal immigrants in italy is estimated at around 650,000 .
tens of thousands of refugees attempt the dangerous journey in less-than-seaworthy boats from north africa into southern europe each year .
overnight , another 73 would-be immigrants arrived in two boats at the italian island of lampedusa . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 67-year-old , who is seen in the us as a possible secretary of state if barack obama wins the presidential election , said he saw karadzic as more evil than either yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic or bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic .

the illinois senator , who conducted no public engagements in berlin on friday , left for paris and a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy shortly after 2.00 pm .
spokesmen for the german coalition parties welcomed the speech , made to an enthusiastic open-air audience of some 200,000 in central berlin thursday evening .
eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu parliamentary caucus , said the speech had been in the best tradition of us foreign policy .
speaking to german media , von klaeden said the speech could as well have been made by obama 's rival for the us presidency , republican senator john mccain .
a man of the world bildunterschrift : obama spoke next to the victory column in berlin gert weisskirchen , social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- foreign policy spokesman , told the online edition of der spiegel news magazine : " it was the speech of a man of the world that was directed not only at germans and europeans , but also at americans . "
the most important message in the speech was that the us and europe could resolve global problems only in cooperation , weisskirchen said .
horst teltschik , who has for the past 10 years headed the munich conference on security policy , said obama had raised outstanding issues that germany and europe had to respond to , for example the german contribution to the nato effort in afghanistan .
in his speech , the illinois senator made a widely anticipated call for a larger german contribution , although in muted form .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops , " he said , touching on an issue that has divided germany .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senator is hugely popular in germany the german troop contribution to afghanistan , currently at 3,500 and set to rise to 4,500 , has broad backing from the political parties , on condition that it is confined to the relatively peaceful north .
but it is unpopular among the german populace , who fear it could increase the risk of terrorist attack .
obama 's foreign tour , aimed at enhancing his foreign policy credentials with the us electorate , began with visits to iraq and afghanistan .
he then travelled to the middle east before arriving in berlin for talks with merkel on thursday .
after paris , the senator travels to london for talks with prime minister gordon brown before returning to the us . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 25.07.2008 -rrb- experts : obama did what he needed to do in berlin barack obama 's speech in in berlin on thursday , july 24 was largely seen by german experts and commentators as a success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 26.07.2008 curtain rises on 97th richard wagner festival in bayreuth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is one of the most important cultural events in germany bayreuth warmed up to norwegian stage director stefan herheim and his multimedia staging of " parsifal , " while katharina wagner seemed to be consolidating her position as potential festival director . bayreuth has often been described as the nerve center of the german nation and its culture .
the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .

the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .

more than 2.5 million are internally displaced .
the unhcr has long lobbied the eu to take in more iraqi refugees .
in april this year , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to do more to provide shelter to christian iraqis who have fled the country to avoid ethnic strife after the 2003 war .
but iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki , on a visit to berlin earlier this week , urged germany to abandon this initiative .
he said security in the country had improved and refugees were needed to rebuild the nation .
dw-world.de spoke with kamal sido of the society for threatened peoples in goettingen about the troubles faced by the christian minority in iraq and their future in the country .
dw-world.de : what 's the current situation of christians in iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamal sido says christians in iraq are being increasingly attacked and persecuted kamal sido : christians in iraq , the chaldeans , the syrian orthodox church and the assyrians , are doing really badly especially since the us-led invasion of 2003 .
the three big religious groups , the shiites , sunnis and the kurds in the north have virtually declared their independence and have their own militias .
the christians , on the other hand , do n't live in a compact area , they do n't have their own militias , they 've been caught in the crossfire and ca n't defend themselves .
the same goes for other minorities such as the kurdish yazidis , the shabbak or the mandians .
how have the everyday lives of christians in iraq been affected ?
they 're directly threatened by violence , death , rape and persecution , their churches are blown up , young people are abducted even by simple criminals who demand a ransom for it .
there 's a prejudice in iraq that the christians are wealthy and that you can squeeze out ransom money from them .
but mostly , the people are killed in the most gruesome ways .
why are the christians persecuted ?
every ethnic group or religious community in iraq is making efforts to keep " clean " the area in which they live .
the sunnis want to keep to themselves , the shiites too , and that 's why there are persecutions .
in addition , islam in iraq has been radicalized since 2003 .
in the meantime , international terrorists such as al-qaeda are now cooperating with local groups .
all that has led to an anti-christian atmosphere .
the christians are accused of collaborating with the americans .
but that 's not true .
if there 's anyone working together with the americans , it 's the kurds in northern iraq , not the christians in baghdad or mosul .
what 's changed since the american invasion ?
at the beginning of the iraq war , a million christians lived in iraq ; today there are just 350,000 in the country , which means more than half have left .
they 've gone to jordan , syria and the kurdish regions of northern iraq .
and those who have money go to europe .
does that mean christians actually fared better under saddam hussein ?
i would n't say that but many led a more inconspicuous life .
but when christians were politically active , they were oppressed just like other minorities .
the chaldeans and the assyrians suffered as much as the kurds at the time .
their villages too were the target of gas attacks by saddam hussein .
how do you see the future of christians in iraq ?
do you think they will be any there in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war the society for threatened peoples has repeatedly drawn attention to the topic .
we 've put together a three-phase plan : firstly all refugees who come to germany should be taken in and without a lot of red tape .
and those refugees who are already here should not be deported back to iraq .
secondly , we want help for the christian refugees in syria and jordan if we do n't want to see an almost 2000-year history go up in smoke .
and thirdly , we need to offer help on the ground - especially in the kurdish regions on iraq and in the so-called niniveh region , northeast of mosul , where the christians largely live . ina rottscheidt interviewed kamal sido -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 2.5 million are internally displaced .
the unhcr has long lobbied the eu to take in more iraqi refugees .
in april this year , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to do more to provide shelter to christian iraqis who have fled the country to avoid ethnic strife after the 2003 war .
but iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki , on a visit to berlin earlier this week , urged germany to abandon this initiative .
he said security in the country had improved and refugees were needed to rebuild the nation .
dw-world.de spoke with kamal sido of the society for threatened peoples in goettingen about the troubles faced by the christian minority in iraq and their future in the country .
dw-world.de : what 's the current situation of christians in iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamal sido says christians in iraq are being increasingly attacked and persecuted kamal sido : christians in iraq , the chaldeans , the syrian orthodox church and the assyrians , are doing really badly especially since the us-led invasion of 2003 .
the three big religious groups , the shiites , sunnis and the kurds in the north have virtually declared their independence and have their own militias .
the christians , on the other hand , do n't live in a compact area , they do n't have their own militias , they 've been caught in the crossfire and ca n't defend themselves .
the same goes for other minorities such as the kurdish yazidis , the shabbak or the mandians .
how have the everyday lives of christians in iraq been affected ?
they 're directly threatened by violence , death , rape and persecution , their churches are blown up , young people are abducted even by simple criminals who demand a ransom for it .
there 's a prejudice in iraq that the christians are wealthy and that you can squeeze out ransom money from them .
but mostly , the people are killed in the most gruesome ways .
why are the christians persecuted ?
every ethnic group or religious community in iraq is making efforts to keep " clean " the area in which they live .
the sunnis want to keep to themselves , the shiites too , and that 's why there are persecutions .
in addition , islam in iraq has been radicalized since 2003 .
in the meantime , international terrorists such as al-qaeda are now cooperating with local groups .
all that has led to an anti-christian atmosphere .
the christians are accused of collaborating with the americans .
but that 's not true .
if there 's anyone working together with the americans , it 's the kurds in northern iraq , not the christians in baghdad or mosul .
what 's changed since the american invasion ?
at the beginning of the iraq war , a million christians lived in iraq ; today there are just 350,000 in the country , which means more than half have left .
they 've gone to jordan , syria and the kurdish regions of northern iraq .
and those who have money go to europe .
does that mean christians actually fared better under saddam hussein ?
i would n't say that but many led a more inconspicuous life .
but when christians were politically active , they were oppressed just like other minorities .
the chaldeans and the assyrians suffered as much as the kurds at the time .
their villages too were the target of gas attacks by saddam hussein .
how do you see the future of christians in iraq ?
do you think they will be any there in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war the society for threatened peoples has repeatedly drawn attention to the topic .
we 've put together a three-phase plan : firstly all refugees who come to germany should be taken in and without a lot of red tape .
and those refugees who are already here should not be deported back to iraq .
secondly , we want help for the christian refugees in syria and jordan if we do n't want to see an almost 2000-year history go up in smoke .
and thirdly , we need to offer help on the ground - especially in the kurdish regions on iraq and in the so-called niniveh region , northeast of mosul , where the christians largely live . ina rottscheidt interviewed kamal sido -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also needs to improve inner-eu relations . martin schulz is a member of european parliament from germany 's social democratic party and head of the socialist group in the european parliament . " world peace can not be safeguarded without making creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it . "
these were the words robert schuman used to introduce his vision of an assembly of european nations .
after centuries of precarious balances of power , devastating wars and the catastrophe of both world wars , a new era of european history began 58 years ago .
the idea of using the integration of countries to create peace among peoples has become a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decades of peace are proof that the eu has been a successful undertaking , schulz said if we pause for a moment , we 'll see that the success is truly breathtaking .
out of the deep wounds of two world wars grew a peace project for europe .
by giving up national sovereignty to a supranational institution , a process of increasingly rapid integration has been started .
a war between member states of the european union is unimaginable . paradoxically , it 's the success of the inner-european peace project that has led to the eu 's predicament of legitimacy .
peace among european nations is seen as a matter of course by younger generations .
they do not ask about the point of the eu with our conflict-heavy past in mind but rather with a view of the future .
it 's time to amend the question of the value of the eu with the question of benefits from the eu .
what does the eu do for us ? the tasks of the 21st century the reversal of climate change , the fair allocation of resources , the management of international finance markets , the maintenance of social standards in the face of global market pressure , the strengthening of the united nations and international law : these are the tasks of the 21st century .
globalization awakens fears and a nostalgic desire to return to the nation-state 's protectionism with its trade barriers and exclusion of anything foreign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of europeans want the eu to play a large role in deciding environmental policy but a return to the past takes the wrong track .
no country will be able to master challenges of this size by themselves , armed with the ideologies of the 19th century . the powerlessness of protectionist nation-states in a divided europe stands in contrast to the power of a united global player .
the surrendering of national sovereignty boosts political sovereignty on the supranational level .
the growing gap between rich and poor , the expanding low-wage sector and the precarious labor relations can be dealt with more effectively on a european level than in national arenas . by unifying social standards and tax rates and by investing in research and development the eu can remain competitive and stave off the social dumping pressure of the mobile world economy .
as a global political actor , the eu is tasked with advancing a transnational environmental policy and a fairer world economic order .
a multilateral dialog based on a policy of peace can be an alternative to the reviled unilateralism of the bush administration . mistakes were made the eu has to achieve all of this .
but it does n't because it 's missing the instruments it needs .
the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty is a bitter defeat for efforts to reform and make the eu more democratic , more efficient and more capable of taking action outside the bloc 's borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu must conquer several new challenges to remain relevent to citizens a necessary phase of deepening relations after the " big bang " of expansion to the east has been absent .
and we 're paying the bitter price for it now .
it 's the very areas that are instrumental to shaping the future that have been struck by operational paralysis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 26.07.2008 expert urges more help for christian minority in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christians in iraq are often caught in the crossfire of ethnic violence dw-world.de spoke with middle east expert kamal sido about the fate of the christian minority in iraq after eu ministers this week dropped calls to take in more iraqi refugees . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- estimates 2 million iraqi refugees are living abroad , mostly in neighboring jordan and syria .
more than 2.5 million are internally displaced .
the unhcr has long lobbied the eu to take in more iraqi refugees .
in april this year , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to do more to provide shelter to christian iraqis who have fled the country to avoid ethnic strife after the 2003 war .
but iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki , on a visit to berlin earlier this week , urged germany to abandon this initiative .
he said security in the country had improved and refugees were needed to rebuild the nation .
dw-world.de spoke with kamal sido of the society for threatened peoples in goettingen about the troubles faced by the christian minority in iraq and their future in the country .
dw-world.de : what 's the current situation of christians in iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamal sido says christians in iraq are being increasingly attacked and persecuted kamal sido : christians in iraq , the chaldeans , the syrian orthodox church and the assyrians , are doing really badly especially since the us-led invasion of 2003 .
the three big religious groups , the shiites , sunnis and the kurds in the north have virtually declared their independence and have their own militias .
the christians , on the other hand , do n't live in a compact area , they do n't have their own militias , they 've been caught in the crossfire and ca n't defend themselves .
the same goes for other minorities such as the kurdish yazidis , the shabbak or the mandians .
how have the everyday lives of christians in iraq been affected ?
they 're directly threatened by violence , death , rape and persecution , their churches are blown up , young people are abducted even by simple criminals who demand a ransom for it .
there 's a prejudice in iraq that the christians are wealthy and that you can squeeze out ransom money from them .
but mostly , the people are killed in the most gruesome ways .
why are the christians persecuted ?
every ethnic group or religious community in iraq is making efforts to keep " clean " the area in which they live .
the sunnis want to keep to themselves , the shiites too , and that 's why there are persecutions .
in addition , islam in iraq has been radicalized since 2003 .
in the meantime , international terrorists such as al-qaeda are now cooperating with local groups .
all that has led to an anti-christian atmosphere .
the christians are accused of collaborating with the americans .
but that 's not true .
if there 's anyone working together with the americans , it 's the kurds in northern iraq , not the christians in baghdad or mosul .
what 's changed since the american invasion ?
at the beginning of the iraq war , a million christians lived in iraq ; today there are just 350,000 in the country , which means more than half have left .
they 've gone to jordan , syria and the kurdish regions of northern iraq .
and those who have money go to europe .
does that mean christians actually fared better under saddam hussein ?
i would n't say that but many led a more inconspicuous life .
but when christians were politically active , they were oppressed just like other minorities .
the chaldeans and the assyrians suffered as much as the kurds at the time .
their villages too were the target of gas attacks by saddam hussein .
how do you see the future of christians in iraq ?
do you think they will be any there in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war the society for threatened peoples has repeatedly drawn attention to the topic .
we 've put together a three-phase plan : firstly all refugees who come to germany should be taken in and without a lot of red tape .
and those refugees who are already here should not be deported back to iraq .
secondly , we want help for the christian refugees in syria and jordan if we do n't want to see an almost 2000-year history go up in smoke .
and thirdly , we need to offer help on the ground - especially in the kurdish regions on iraq and in the so-called niniveh region , northeast of mosul , where the christians largely live . ina rottscheidt interviewed kamal sido -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 26.07.2008 curtain rises on 97th richard wagner festival in bayreuth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is one of the most important cultural events in germany bayreuth warmed up to norwegian stage director stefan herheim and his multimedia staging of " parsifal , " while katharina wagner seemed to be consolidating her position as potential festival director . bayreuth has often been described as the nerve center of the german nation and its culture .
the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .
the state of innocence thus suggested is soon over : the holy ritual of transubstantiation is followed by a seduction scene and images of world war i , with soldiers gently swaying to wagner 's delicate string sounds as though at the oktoberfest . the dark moments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihoko fujimura was convincing as kundry it 's clear that this retrospective of german history can not exclude its darkest era .
kundry appears to parsifal in act two in a curly blonde wig under a top hat à la marlene dietrich .
the evil sorcerer klingsor is in high heels , black lace stockings and garters reminiscent of the " rocky horror picture show . " after kundry 's kiss in act two , red flags with black swastikas - in present-day germany , an illegal symbol - are suspended full-length on the set , and nazi soldiers occupy the scene .
when parsifal takes the holy speer , that disturbing scenario is dispelled , the reichs-eagle crashes to the floor and shatters into bits . act three takes the viewer to the bombed-out ruins of wahnfried .
after the good friday music , the scene is transformed to the bundestag , modern germany 's parliament , and amfortas , leader of the grail knights , is the chancellor .
but even that scene is superseded in a hopeful vision of the future : a gigantic globe magnifies the lush red light of the grail , then turns to reflect the audience in the festspielhaus itself . making music visual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner wanted to create a " total work of art " in this reporter 's nineteen-year history of visiting the bayreuth festival , this was the first time that a stage director was not booed at the premiere .
with so much food for thought , a term by richard wagner came to mind : the goal of his " total work of art " was to be " make music visual . "
although there were moments where it seemed that conductor daniele gatti - giving his bayreuth debut - had compromised to accommodate the elaborate stage machinations , the musical experience was in fact made more satisfying , not less , through the array of concepts and images served up by stefan herheim . not least of all , it was a superb cast , with all protagonists demonstrating robust vocal strength and clear articulation .
they included korean baritone kwangchul youn as gurnemanz and japanese mezzo-soprano mihoko fujimura as kundry .
there was also a strong debut by german baritone detlev roth as amfortas and the first truly satisfying parsifal heard here in a very long time : british tenor christopher ventris , also giving his bayreuth debut . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .
the state of innocence thus suggested is soon over : the holy ritual of transubstantiation is followed by a seduction scene and images of world war i , with soldiers gently swaying to wagner 's delicate string sounds as though at the oktoberfest . the dark moments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihoko fujimura was convincing as kundry it 's clear that this retrospective of german history can not exclude its darkest era .
kundry appears to parsifal in act two in a curly blonde wig under a top hat à la marlene dietrich .
the evil sorcerer klingsor is in high heels , black lace stockings and garters reminiscent of the " rocky horror picture show . " after kundry 's kiss in act two , red flags with black swastikas - in present-day germany , an illegal symbol - are suspended full-length on the set , and nazi soldiers occupy the scene .
when parsifal takes the holy speer , that disturbing scenario is dispelled , the reichs-eagle crashes to the floor and shatters into bits . act three takes the viewer to the bombed-out ruins of wahnfried .
after the good friday music , the scene is transformed to the bundestag , modern germany 's parliament , and amfortas , leader of the grail knights , is the chancellor .
but even that scene is superseded in a hopeful vision of the future : a gigantic globe magnifies the lush red light of the grail , then turns to reflect the audience in the festspielhaus itself . making music visual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner wanted to create a " total work of art " in this reporter 's nineteen-year history of visiting the bayreuth festival , this was the first time that a stage director was not booed at the premiere .
with so much food for thought , a term by richard wagner came to mind : the goal of his " total work of art " was to be " make music visual . "
although there were moments where it seemed that conductor daniele gatti - giving his bayreuth debut - had compromised to accommodate the elaborate stage machinations , the musical experience was in fact made more satisfying , not less , through the array of concepts and images served up by stefan herheim . not least of all , it was a superb cast , with all protagonists demonstrating robust vocal strength and clear articulation .
they included korean baritone kwangchul youn as gurnemanz and japanese mezzo-soprano mihoko fujimura as kundry .
there was also a strong debut by german baritone detlev roth as amfortas and the first truly satisfying parsifal heard here in a very long time : british tenor christopher ventris , also giving his bayreuth debut . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .
the state of innocence thus suggested is soon over : the holy ritual of transubstantiation is followed by a seduction scene and images of world war i , with soldiers gently swaying to wagner 's delicate string sounds as though at the oktoberfest . the dark moments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihoko fujimura was convincing as kundry it 's clear that this retrospective of german history can not exclude its darkest era .
kundry appears to parsifal in act two in a curly blonde wig under a top hat à la marlene dietrich .
the evil sorcerer klingsor is in high heels , black lace stockings and garters reminiscent of the " rocky horror picture show . " after kundry 's kiss in act two , red flags with black swastikas - in present-day germany , an illegal symbol - are suspended full-length on the set , and nazi soldiers occupy the scene .
when parsifal takes the holy speer , that disturbing scenario is dispelled , the reichs-eagle crashes to the floor and shatters into bits . act three takes the viewer to the bombed-out ruins of wahnfried .
after the good friday music , the scene is transformed to the bundestag , modern germany 's parliament , and amfortas , leader of the grail knights , is the chancellor .
but even that scene is superseded in a hopeful vision of the future : a gigantic globe magnifies the lush red light of the grail , then turns to reflect the audience in the festspielhaus itself . making music visual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner wanted to create a " total work of art " in this reporter 's nineteen-year history of visiting the bayreuth festival , this was the first time that a stage director was not booed at the premiere .
with so much food for thought , a term by richard wagner came to mind : the goal of his " total work of art " was to be " make music visual . "
although there were moments where it seemed that conductor daniele gatti - giving his bayreuth debut - had compromised to accommodate the elaborate stage machinations , the musical experience was in fact made more satisfying , not less , through the array of concepts and images served up by stefan herheim . not least of all , it was a superb cast , with all protagonists demonstrating robust vocal strength and clear articulation .
they included korean baritone kwangchul youn as gurnemanz and japanese mezzo-soprano mihoko fujimura as kundry .

" serbia will fully obey the international law both when it comes to the hague and to the unilateral declaration of kosovo 's independence , " mirko cvetkovic said in an interview with beta news agency .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and was recognized by majority of eu countries and the united states .
serbia and its ally russia oppose it .
bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic was arrested on monday night in belgrade and is waiting extradition to the hague .
his warlord ratko mladic and croatian serb goran hadzic are still on the run .
eu prospects cvetkovic said he expected an easing of eu conditions on serbia after clear confirmation that belgrade was fulfilling its international obligations to the hague .
serbia and the eu are yet to ratify the stabilization and association agreement between the balkan country and the 27-member block .
cvetkovic said he hopes serbia will get the candidate status for the eu by the end of 2008 or the last-minute appeal meanwhile , belgrade daily politika reported that radovan karadzic 's lawyer filed a last-minute appeal late on friday seeking to prevent the bosnian serb leader 's extradition to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
attorney svetozar vujacic had until friday midnight to file an appeal .
he refused to tell local media from which post he would file it and refused to confirm whether he had filed it because " that 's part of the defense strategy . "
vujacic said earlier he expected a belgrade court to reject the application , but that he wanted at least a delay so karadzic 's wife and daughter could visit him in custody in belgrade .
the court will have three days to discuss the appeal and will most likely meet and decide on monday .
serbia 's ministry of justice has to sign the extradition warrant before karadzic can be sent to the hague . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the illinois senator , who conducted no public engagements in berlin on friday , left for paris and a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy shortly after 2.00 pm .
spokesmen for the german coalition parties welcomed the speech , made to an enthusiastic open-air audience of some 200,000 in central berlin thursday evening .
eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu parliamentary caucus , said the speech had been in the best tradition of us foreign policy .
speaking to german media , von klaeden said the speech could as well have been made by obama 's rival for the us presidency , republican senator john mccain .

the most important message in the speech was that the us and europe could resolve global problems only in cooperation , weisskirchen said .
horst teltschik , who has for the past 10 years headed the munich conference on security policy , said obama had raised outstanding issues that germany and europe had to respond to , for example the german contribution to the nato effort in afghanistan .
in his speech , the illinois senator made a widely anticipated call for a larger german contribution , although in muted form .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops , " he said , touching on an issue that has divided germany .

but it is unpopular among the german populace , who fear it could increase the risk of terrorist attack .
obama 's foreign tour , aimed at enhancing his foreign policy credentials with the us electorate , began with visits to iraq and afghanistan .

the illinois senator , who conducted no public engagements in berlin on friday , left for paris and a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy shortly after 2.00 pm .
spokesmen for the german coalition parties welcomed the speech , made to an enthusiastic open-air audience of some 200,000 in central berlin thursday evening .
eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu parliamentary caucus , said the speech had been in the best tradition of us foreign policy .
speaking to german media , von klaeden said the speech could as well have been made by obama 's rival for the us presidency , republican senator john mccain .
a man of the world bildunterschrift : obama spoke next to the victory column in berlin gert weisskirchen , social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- foreign policy spokesman , told the online edition of der spiegel news magazine : " it was the speech of a man of the world that was directed not only at germans and europeans , but also at americans . "
the most important message in the speech was that the us and europe could resolve global problems only in cooperation , weisskirchen said .
horst teltschik , who has for the past 10 years headed the munich conference on security policy , said obama had raised outstanding issues that germany and europe had to respond to , for example the german contribution to the nato effort in afghanistan .
in his speech , the illinois senator made a widely anticipated call for a larger german contribution , although in muted form .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops , " he said , touching on an issue that has divided germany .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senator is hugely popular in germany the german troop contribution to afghanistan , currently at 3,500 and set to rise to 4,500 , has broad backing from the political parties , on condition that it is confined to the relatively peaceful north .
but it is unpopular among the german populace , who fear it could increase the risk of terrorist attack .
obama 's foreign tour , aimed at enhancing his foreign policy credentials with the us electorate , began with visits to iraq and afghanistan .
he then travelled to the middle east before arriving in berlin for talks with merkel on thursday .
after paris , the senator travels to london for talks with prime minister gordon brown before returning to the us . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche would report profits of more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros .
porsche would earn a relatively minor 1.2 billion euros from the sale of its own vehicles , while options and dividends from vw would also contribute to the profits , der spiegel said .
it speculated that porsche boss wendelin wiedeking could take home a 100-million-euro pay package .
wiedeking 's reported 60 million euros last year provoked widespread comment in germany , most of it negative .
porsche has encountered opposition from the german state in its lengthy battle to seize control of vw .
the state of lower saxony , where vw 's wolfsburg headquarters are situated , has a 20.3-percent stake , and a special provision in german law allows it to block major decisions .
usually 25 percent is required .
the european court of justice ruled against the special provision in october last year , and the european union has urged the german government to review the legal position . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 26.07.2008 curtain rises on 97th richard wagner festival in bayreuth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is one of the most important cultural events in germany bayreuth warmed up to norwegian stage director stefan herheim and his multimedia staging of " parsifal , " while katharina wagner seemed to be consolidating her position as potential festival director . bayreuth has often been described as the nerve center of the german nation and its culture .
the images most familiar to the public are the yearly summer ritual of the motorcade to the festspielhaus and the celebrities who disembark and wave to the crowd .
having come to see the music dramas , they themselves are first the object of attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is an avid opera fan guests on friday , july 25 , included chancellor angela merkel and her husband , professor joachim sauer , bavarian governor guenther beckstein and his wife marga ; economics minister michael glos , liberal democrat party chairman guido westerwelle , tv moderator thomas gottschalk and the ever-popular former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher . but there was a major difference to the ritual greeting this time .
in his final year as festival director , wolfgang wagner , 88 years old , only briefly waved to onlookers outside the " king 's portal " of the festspielhaus before retiring to the interior to greet vip 's there .
wolfgang was flanked by his daughter katharina , but gone was his wife gudrun wagner , who died unexpectedly last november . a musical dynasty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner is likely to succeed her father , wolfgang gudrun , wolfgang 's chief assistant , was known as the indispensable woman on the " green hill , " the one who knew the workings of the place better than anyone else .
with wolfgang in poor health , katharina , also assistant to the director , has assumed that role .
at the age of 30 , she aspires to the position of festival director in tandem with her elder half-sister , eva wagner-pasquier , who did not appear on opening day . 2008 is the year for katharina to prove that she has what it takes .
along with new initiatives in the dissemination of festival performances through the mass media , she oversaw an ambitious new production of " parsifal " by stage director stefan herheim and conductor daniele gatti . with the eyes and ears of the world trained on bayreuth , so was the festival itself this time : the new " parsifal " is a self-referential examination of 126 years of turbulent german history since the world premiere of that work here in 1882 .
the set by designer heike scheele combines elements of richard wagner 's residence wahnfried and the festspielhaus itself . a multimedia spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new production of " parsifal " was directed by norwegian stefan herheim the new " parsifal " is a multi-media spectacle with generous use of tricks and technology , the vast stage and technical resources of richard wagner 's historic festival theater exploited to the hilt .
what to do with a drama strikingly lacking in action , where key moments take place in narration , in the retrospective ?
illustrate them with projected stills and videos , visual leitmotifs and character doubles , with elements sometimes moving or changing every few seconds . it 's almost too much for the eye to follow : the title character is a pudgy young man in a sailor suit , then a young boy , then a newborn infant , then the holy grail .
with the use of trap doors , mist and lighting effects , kundry morphs into amfortas .
these changes occur so subtly and organically that the viewer is often baffled .
the set itself expands or contracts to fit the music or an underlying dramatic thought : " you see , my son , time becomes space here , " is a line from wagner 's " parsifal " - penned decades before einstein 's theory of relativity . in this tour-de-force of modern german history , the drama begins in wagner 's own time .
the costumes by gesine völlm depict a fin de siècle society with each character carrying angels ' wings .
the state of innocence thus suggested is soon over : the holy ritual of transubstantiation is followed by a seduction scene and images of world war i , with soldiers gently swaying to wagner 's delicate string sounds as though at the oktoberfest . the dark moments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihoko fujimura was convincing as kundry it 's clear that this retrospective of german history can not exclude its darkest era .
kundry appears to parsifal in act two in a curly blonde wig under a top hat à la marlene dietrich .
the evil sorcerer klingsor is in high heels , black lace stockings and garters reminiscent of the " rocky horror picture show . " after kundry 's kiss in act two , red flags with black swastikas - in present-day germany , an illegal symbol - are suspended full-length on the set , and nazi soldiers occupy the scene .
when parsifal takes the holy speer , that disturbing scenario is dispelled , the reichs-eagle crashes to the floor and shatters into bits . act three takes the viewer to the bombed-out ruins of wahnfried .
after the good friday music , the scene is transformed to the bundestag , modern germany 's parliament , and amfortas , leader of the grail knights , is the chancellor .
but even that scene is superseded in a hopeful vision of the future : a gigantic globe magnifies the lush red light of the grail , then turns to reflect the audience in the festspielhaus itself . making music visual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner wanted to create a " total work of art " in this reporter 's nineteen-year history of visiting the bayreuth festival , this was the first time that a stage director was not booed at the premiere .
with so much food for thought , a term by richard wagner came to mind : the goal of his " total work of art " was to be " make music visual . "
although there were moments where it seemed that conductor daniele gatti - giving his bayreuth debut - had compromised to accommodate the elaborate stage machinations , the musical experience was in fact made more satisfying , not less , through the array of concepts and images served up by stefan herheim . not least of all , it was a superb cast , with all protagonists demonstrating robust vocal strength and clear articulation .
they included korean baritone kwangchul youn as gurnemanz and japanese mezzo-soprano mihoko fujimura as kundry .
there was also a strong debut by german baritone detlev roth as amfortas and the first truly satisfying parsifal heard here in a very long time : british tenor christopher ventris , also giving his bayreuth debut . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they want the market regulator to make lenders behave responsibly , as some companies have lent money at a rate equivalent to almost 2,000 % annually .
payday loans typically involve a lender advancing a customer cash , usually for a month , against a post-dated cheque .
the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- said they would be covered by investigations of the issue of responsible lending .
although the loans , often used by people to tide themselves over until they get their wages , generally attract high rates of interest , the businesses offering them are properly licensed and they say they are professional and responsible .
one company providing payday loans , the money shop , told bbc breakfast it offered a valuable service to those " who may alternatively be faced with high unauthorised overdraft costs " .
it said the cost of its lending products reflected the levels of risks it took .
' excesses ' beccy boden wilks , of national debtline , a helpline for those in debt , said that the credit crunch meant that people were looking at alternative forms of borrowing .
" if they ca n't get another credit card balance transfer , they will start to look at other forms of borrowing , which could be payday loans or pawnbroking , which are quite expensive . "
damon gibbons , of debt campaign group debt on our doorstep , said urgent action was needed .
" we certainly welcome the fact the oft says it is looking at the issue of responsible lending more generally in the uk , " he said .
" but we want to push them further to ensure payday lending is at the top of their list and is acted on immediately .
" we believe there is a lot more they could be doing to curb the worst excesses of the payday industry . "
many loan shops are owned by american companies , and hundreds have opened in the uk after some state authorities capped the rates they could charge in the us .

" every day we hear that christians and muslims are in an eternal quarrel but when audiences see this film i think it will change something inside them . "
since the 1970s and 1980s - when there was a rise in extremist islamist thought and christian radicalism - there have been frequent sectarian clashes in egypt .
now tensions are escalating again according to a new report by a group monitoring religious freedom .
the egyptian initiative for personal rights -lrb- eipr -rrb- investigated two outbreaks of violence in the fayoum area , south of cairo , last month .
in one case there were rumours that a woman who had converted from christianity to islam had been abducted by her coptic family .
it led to hundreds of muslim villagers going on the rampage , looting coptic shops and setting property alight .
stones were thrown at the local church .
in the second incident , coptic residents of a small town were attacked following claims that a married muslim woman and a christian man were having an affair .
" sectarian tensions and violence have reached an alarming level , " says eipr director , hossam bahgat .
" often a minor fight between muslim and christian neighbours develops very quickly into sectarian clashes . "
while egyptian commentators are divided over the contribution that hassan and morqos makes to the debate about religious discrimination , mr bahgat welcomes it .
" many people have written that it 's a bit superficial but i believe the fact that it was made is really a positive development . "
" it 's a mainstream film in which the sole subject is muslim-christian relations - but it does n't paint a rosy picture . "
social taboo an early scene in the film introduces the reasons for hostility and anger on both sides of the religious divide .
it shows clerics on the way to an annual national convention for muslim-christian dialogue in cairo .
priests dismiss the event and complain that the government puts severe restrictions on building churches and the number of copts in ministerial positions .
meanwhile , muslim scholars discuss how copts - who make up an estimated 10 % of egyptians - control the national economy .
such remarks are widely uttered but putting them on the big screen has broken a social taboo .
campaigners against sectarian violence are calling for religious leaders and egypt 's government to acknowledge the problem and take steps to reduce it , making sure sectarian strife does not spiral out of control like in iraq and lebanon .
but angry comments on the message boards for hassan and morqos and calls for a boycott make it clear there is a lot to do to change prejudices .
adel imam , a muslim , has been accused of preaching christianity in his portrayal of boulos .
yet many thousands have been to see it and adel imam himself hopes it will foster national unity .
" i have made a work of art .
that is what i can do .
i have declared war using art against the extremists - against those who foment differences between us . "

it has got egyptians talking about tensions between the country 's majority muslim population and its christian minority .
the film , hassan and morqos , co-stars egyptian comedy legend adel imam as boulos , a coptic christian priest , and alexandria-born hollywood star omar sharif as sheikh mahmoud , a muslim preacher .
often a minor fight between muslim and christian neighbours develops very quickly into sectarian clashes hossam bahgat , egyptian initiative for personal rights both play moderates forced to go into hiding and change their religious identities -lrb- becoming hassan and morqos , respectively -rrb- when they are threatened by extremists in their own communities .
brought together by their parallel predicaments , the two men come to live in the same building with their families .
they become friends - even opening a joint business - and before long their children fall in love , unhindered by religious restraints .
escalating tensions " i think a film should have a message and one of my messages is to make people love each other , " says writer yousef maati .
" every day we hear that christians and muslims are in an eternal quarrel but when audiences see this film i think it will change something inside them . "
hardliners have criticised imam , who is muslim , for preaching christianity since the 1970s and 1980s - when there was a rise in extremist islamist thought and christian radicalism - there have been frequent sectarian clashes in egypt .
now tensions are escalating again according to a new report by a group monitoring religious freedom .
the egyptian initiative for personal rights -lrb- eipr -rrb- investigated two outbreaks of violence in the fayoum area , south of cairo , last month .
in one case there were rumours that a woman who had converted from christianity to islam had been abducted by her coptic family .
it led to hundreds of muslim villagers going on the rampage , looting coptic shops and setting property alight .
stones were thrown at the local church .
in the second incident , coptic residents of a small town were attacked following claims that a married muslim woman and a christian man were having an affair .
" sectarian tensions and violence have reached an alarming level , " says eipr director , hossam bahgat .
" often a minor fight between muslim and christian neighbours develops very quickly into sectarian clashes . "
while egyptian commentators are divided over the contribution that hassan and morqos makes to the debate about religious discrimination , mr bahgat welcomes it .
" many people have written that it 's a bit superficial but i believe the fact that it was made is really a positive development . "
" it 's a mainstream film in which the sole subject is muslim-christian relations - but it does n't paint a rosy picture . "
social taboo egyptian religious leaders profess unity but there are underlying tensions an early scene in the film introduces the reasons for hostility and anger on both sides of the religious divide .
it shows clerics on the way to an annual national convention for muslim-christian dialogue in cairo .
priests dismiss the event and complain that the government puts severe restrictions on building churches and the number of copts in ministerial positions .
meanwhile , muslim scholars discuss how copts - who make up an estimated 10 % of egyptians - control the national economy .
such remarks are widely uttered but putting them on the big screen has broken a social taboo .
campaigners against sectarian violence are calling for religious leaders and egypt 's government to acknowledge the problem and take steps to reduce it , making sure sectarian strife does not spiral out of control like in iraq and lebanon .
but angry comments on the message boards for hassan and morqos and calls for a boycott make it clear there is a lot to do to change prejudices .
adel imam , a muslim , has been accused of preaching christianity in his portrayal of boulos .
yet many thousands have been to see it and adel imam himself hopes it will foster national unity .
" i have made a work of art .
that is what i can do .
i have declared war using art against the extremists - against those who foment differences between us . "
" i hope christians and muslims will leave the cinema and embrace and kiss one another . "
