the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutch meanwhile crushed romanian dreams . andrea pirlo and daniele de rossi scored for italy . the azzurri needed help from group winners the netherlands , who beat romania in berne by the same score , even though they played with a second-string side . klaas-jan huntelaar and robin van persie were the goal scorers for the oranjes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery suffered a broken leg in zurich , two-time champions france rushed from one disaster to the next as inspirational midfielder franck ribery was carried off with a suspected broken leg in the seventh minute . in the 25th minute , french defender eric abidal was sent off for a tackle in the area on luca toni , and pirlo made no mistake from the resulting spot kick . there was no coming back for the french , and de rossi 's 62nd-minute goal , which deflected off french captain thierry henry , made no difference as the french had been all but counted out at that stage already . love-stricken coach french coach raymond domenech , who is expected to be given the boot after the defeat , refused to comment on his future straight after the match when asked by french television , and instead proposed to his girlfriend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech just wants to get married now " i have nothing to say about my job , but i will say that i want to marry estelle , " domenech told m6 television just moments after the defeat . in berne , romania , who surprisingly went into their final game with a chance to advance to the quarter-finals , would have joined the dutch in the next round had they won . in a game in which dutch coach marco van basten played his second string , the opening goal was scored in the 54th minute by huntelaar from an ibrahim afellay cross . van persie added a second three minutes from the end with a well-taken shot from inside the area , after a defence-splitting pass found him in space .
the arsenal forward went around two defenders before unleashing a powerful strike . the games ahead the victory sees the netherlands win the group with nine points from their three victories , while italy are second on four points .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.06.2008 carmaker daimler sets up mercedes plant in low-cost hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes to produce its compact car models more cheaply in future daimler is investing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in a plant in hungary , making it the last major carmaker to set up shop in low-cost eastern europe and the move the single biggest foreign investment in hungary . the stuttgart-based carmaker said in a statement its mercedes-benz car unit would invest 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- to build the kecskemet plant near budapest , and would sign a memorandum of understanding with government officials there in the coming weeks .
the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .
bildunterschrift : volkswagen has a plant in the hungarian town of györ volkswagen opened its first plant at the end of 2007 near moscow to serve the fast-growing russian market , audi employs some 6,000 employees in the hungarian town of györ and volkswagen 's czech subsidiary , skoda has a strong presence across eastern europe .
in addition , german luxury carmaker bmw has long been assembling cars in kaliningrad in russia . and , renault , psa peugeot citroen , general motors and toyota have all long secured a foothold in the region . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .

the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .

ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .
russia get a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's arshavin is back on the pitch russian newspapers may have deemed the team 's 4-1 loss to spain a disgrace , but the russians generated a decent number of chances in that match .
and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .

" we have already achieved a lot in climate protection , " gabriel said .
" the kyoto goal has almost been reached . " the measures have yet to be passed by both houses of parliament . higher standards among the measures agreed are higher standards in insulation and energy conservation for buildings , extending the electricity grid to allow generation by offshore wind power and increasing the motorway tolls paid by long-distance hauliers . the cabinet has , however , postponed plans to change the basis of vehicle tax from engine capacity to exhaust emissions to encourage fuel economy . economics minister michael glos said the government had now approved all the measures decided on in its integrated climate and energy package agreed last year . the nuke question glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that after climate protection , the focus was now on world energy prices .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "

schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 18.06.2008 eu backs controversial rules for expelling illegal migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping to deter future immigrants to take the illegal path to the bloc eu lawmakers voted wednesday , june 18 , for a new set of common rules for expelling illegal immigrants from the 27-nation bloc despite widespread criticism by human rights groups . eu lawmakers approved the law which allows illegal immigrants to be detained for up to 18 months despite vocal opposition from rights groups and socialists , greens and other lawmakers in the european parliament .
the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening .

a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

the dutch meanwhile crushed romanian dreams . andrea pirlo and daniele de rossi scored for italy . the azzurri needed help from group winners the netherlands , who beat romania in berne by the same score , even though they played with a second-string side . klaas-jan huntelaar and robin van persie were the goal scorers for the oranjes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery suffered a broken leg in zurich , two-time champions france rushed from one disaster to the next as inspirational midfielder franck ribery was carried off with a suspected broken leg in the seventh minute . in the 25th minute , french defender eric abidal was sent off for a tackle in the area on luca toni , and pirlo made no mistake from the resulting spot kick . there was no coming back for the french , and de rossi 's 62nd-minute goal , which deflected off french captain thierry henry , made no difference as the french had been all but counted out at that stage already . love-stricken coach french coach raymond domenech , who is expected to be given the boot after the defeat , refused to comment on his future straight after the match when asked by french television , and instead proposed to his girlfriend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech just wants to get married now " i have nothing to say about my job , but i will say that i want to marry estelle , " domenech told m6 television just moments after the defeat . in berne , romania , who surprisingly went into their final game with a chance to advance to the quarter-finals , would have joined the dutch in the next round had they won . in a game in which dutch coach marco van basten played his second string , the opening goal was scored in the 54th minute by huntelaar from an ibrahim afellay cross . van persie added a second three minutes from the end with a well-taken shot from inside the area , after a defence-splitting pass found him in space .
the arsenal forward went around two defenders before unleashing a powerful strike . the games ahead the victory sees the netherlands win the group with nine points from their three victories , while italy are second on four points .
romania had two points , while two-time champions france will return home with just one point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be a litte early for the dutch to claim the title italy will face spain in the quarter-finals , while the netherlands will take on either russia or sweden . meanwhile , three-time champions germany , who on monday qualified for the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over austria , might be without midfielder torsten frings and coach joachim loew in their game thursday against portugal . an x-ray revealed that frings broke a rib in the game against austria , while loew is tentatively suspended for one game after being sent into the stands during the game in vienna . uefa announced tuesday that loew and his austrian counterpart , josef hickerberger , who was also sent off , will submit a written statement to the uefa disciplinary body . " the referee will also submit a report , and then the body will decide whether to scrap the suspension , leave it or increase it , " uefa communication manager william gaillard said . faithful greeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel 's love affair with greece is far from over meanwhile , defending champions greece , who have already been knocked out of the tournament , announced that german coach otto rehhagel will stay on as coach .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .

dw-world 's jefferson chase pays tribute to a side that stayed true to the spirit of fair competition . it 's a not very well kept secret that teams who qualify early in the group stages of major competitions sometimes look at the rest of the table when deciding how to play their final matches .
the bookmakers made holland the underdogs going into their game against romania on june 17 - the only conceivable reason being the idea that the netherlands might want to lose to prevent italy and france from progressing beyond group c. holland coach marco van basten was criticized for resting some of his regulars - a rational move which every team has a right to make when there 's nothing on the line for them .
and the netherlands showed great sportsmanship in downing the romanians 2-0 , a result that kept italy alive in the tournament .
not every team would have behaved so fairly .
legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .
and in order to avoid a repeat of that dully predictable encounter , soccer 's governing bodies ordered that subsequent final group matches be played simultaneously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany need strategic , personnel adjustments to beat portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can recover - with or without frings portugal are favored in the first euro 2008 quarter-final , after germany stumbled through the group stage .
but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .

" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .

ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .
so current form as well as personnel issues could be the deciding factors .
ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .

and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .
so current form as well as personnel issues could be the deciding factors .
ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .

and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.06.2008 carmaker daimler sets up mercedes plant in low-cost hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes to produce its compact car models more cheaply in future daimler is investing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in a plant in hungary , making it the last major carmaker to set up shop in low-cost eastern europe and the move the single biggest foreign investment in hungary . the stuttgart-based carmaker said in a statement its mercedes-benz car unit would invest 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- to build the kecskemet plant near budapest , and would sign a memorandum of understanding with government officials there in the coming weeks .
the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.06.2008 carmaker daimler sets up mercedes plant in low-cost hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes to produce its compact car models more cheaply in future daimler is investing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in a plant in hungary , making it the last major carmaker to set up shop in low-cost eastern europe and the move the single biggest foreign investment in hungary . the stuttgart-based carmaker said in a statement its mercedes-benz car unit would invest 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- to build the kecskemet plant near budapest , and would sign a memorandum of understanding with government officials there in the coming weeks .
the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's rainer sollich the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany need strategic , personnel adjustments to beat portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can recover - with or without frings portugal are favored in the first euro 2008 quarter-final , after germany stumbled through the group stage .
but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany need strategic , personnel adjustments to beat portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can recover - with or without frings portugal are favored in the first euro 2008 quarter-final , after germany stumbled through the group stage .
but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .

dw-world 's jefferson chase pays tribute to a side that stayed true to the spirit of fair competition . it 's a not very well kept secret that teams who qualify early in the group stages of major competitions sometimes look at the rest of the table when deciding how to play their final matches .
the bookmakers made holland the underdogs going into their game against romania on june 17 - the only conceivable reason being the idea that the netherlands might want to lose to prevent italy and france from progressing beyond group c. holland coach marco van basten was criticized for resting some of his regulars - a rational move which every team has a right to make when there 's nothing on the line for them .
and the netherlands showed great sportsmanship in downing the romanians 2-0 , a result that kept italy alive in the tournament .
not every team would have behaved so fairly .
legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .
and in order to avoid a repeat of that dully predictable encounter , soccer 's governing bodies ordered that subsequent final group matches be played simultaneously .
sportsmanship versus self-interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italisn fans knew whom they had to thank for survival but there 's no way to avoid all conflicts between sportsmanship and self-interest , as this year 's tournament showed a dutch loss to romania would have meant the end for reigning world champions italy , a team that 's often been accused of diving in the past and that knocked holland out of the 2000 euro .
and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .
few fans outside of italy would have thought that badly of holland , if they , having survived the group of death , had decided they did n't really need to see the squadra azzurra again so soon .
dutch integrity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie says the oranjes do n't have a b-team but the netherlands are known as a team that prioritizes the beautiful aspects of the beautiful game over merely getting results .
holland 's players bristled at the mere suggestion that , by resting its regular starters , the team was n't giving its all .
" this win speaks volumes , " said forward and goal-scorer robin van persie after the match .
" we do n't have a b-team .
we have a squad of 23 players . "
italy could have a chance to reward such dutch integrity by playing a fair match , should the two teams meet up in the semis .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .

ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .

and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .

ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .

schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.06.2008 carmaker daimler sets up mercedes plant in low-cost hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes to produce its compact car models more cheaply in future daimler is investing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in a plant in hungary , making it the last major carmaker to set up shop in low-cost eastern europe and the move the single biggest foreign investment in hungary . the stuttgart-based carmaker said in a statement its mercedes-benz car unit would invest 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- to build the kecskemet plant near budapest , and would sign a memorandum of understanding with government officials there in the coming weeks .
the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .

but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .

since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany against irish pressure as eu meets in no vote shadow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could be banging its head against the wall over the result of the irish referendum the german government is firmly against applying pressure to ireland over the ratification of the eu 's reform treaty following the irish referendum last week .
the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presses ahead with treaty ratification despite irish " no " ahead of a summit in brussels , the european union called wednesday for the ratification process of the lisbon treaty to continue despite its crushing rejection by irish voters last week .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .

he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 18.06.2008 eu backs controversial rules for expelling illegal migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping to deter future immigrants to take the illegal path to the bloc eu lawmakers voted wednesday , june 18 , for a new set of common rules for expelling illegal immigrants from the 27-nation bloc despite widespread criticism by human rights groups . eu lawmakers approved the law which allows illegal immigrants to be detained for up to 18 months despite vocal opposition from rights groups and socialists , greens and other lawmakers in the european parliament .
the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2008 eu presses ahead with treaty ratification despite irish " no " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that thick pile called " lisbon " will be on the table waiting for eu lawmakers at the summit ahead of a summit in brussels , the european union called wednesday for the ratification process of the lisbon treaty to continue despite its crushing rejection by irish voters last week . a planned two-day european union summit which opens on thursday , june 19 , meant to focus on weighty topics such as rising oil prices is likely to be overshadowed by the institutional crisis plaguing the bloc after irish voters last week resoundingly rejected the lisbon treaty .
ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

" we have already achieved a lot in climate protection , " gabriel said .
" the kyoto goal has almost been reached . " the measures have yet to be passed by both houses of parliament . higher standards among the measures agreed are higher standards in insulation and energy conservation for buildings , extending the electricity grid to allow generation by offshore wind power and increasing the motorway tolls paid by long-distance hauliers . the cabinet has , however , postponed plans to change the basis of vehicle tax from engine capacity to exhaust emissions to encourage fuel economy . economics minister michael glos said the government had now approved all the measures decided on in its integrated climate and energy package agreed last year . the nuke question glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that after climate protection , the focus was now on world energy prices . " we have to limit our dependency on oil and gas , " he said , calling for a broad range of energy sources , increased efficiency in energy use and the expansion of renewable energy resources . he raised the possibility of extending the operating lives of germany 's nuclear power plants . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in merkel 's coalition , are sticking to a law passed under the previous chancellor , gerhard schroeder , that germany must phase out the use of nuclear power by 2021 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .
so current form as well as personnel issues could be the deciding factors .
ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .
russia get a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's arshavin is back on the pitch russian newspapers may have deemed the team 's 4-1 loss to spain a disgrace , but the russians generated a decent number of chances in that match .
and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .
but sweden 's tabloid newspaper aftonbladet did its best to stir up a bit of heat with an article playing on the stereotype of nouveau riche russians .
the story featured a picture of humble swedes staying in a camper van while the rich russkies whooped it up in a hotel room .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .

the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 netherlands should be hailed for playing to win against romania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland deserves high fives for fairness the dutch had every reason to lose their final group match against romania and only one to win - sportsmanship .
dw-world 's jefferson chase pays tribute to a side that stayed true to the spirit of fair competition . it 's a not very well kept secret that teams who qualify early in the group stages of major competitions sometimes look at the rest of the table when deciding how to play their final matches .
the bookmakers made holland the underdogs going into their game against romania on june 17 - the only conceivable reason being the idea that the netherlands might want to lose to prevent italy and france from progressing beyond group c. holland coach marco van basten was criticized for resting some of his regulars - a rational move which every team has a right to make when there 's nothing on the line for them .
and the netherlands showed great sportsmanship in downing the romanians 2-0 , a result that kept italy alive in the tournament .
not every team would have behaved so fairly .
legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .
and in order to avoid a repeat of that dully predictable encounter , soccer 's governing bodies ordered that subsequent final group matches be played simultaneously .
sportsmanship versus self-interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italisn fans knew whom they had to thank for survival but there 's no way to avoid all conflicts between sportsmanship and self-interest , as this year 's tournament showed a dutch loss to romania would have meant the end for reigning world champions italy , a team that 's often been accused of diving in the past and that knocked holland out of the 2000 euro .
and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .
few fans outside of italy would have thought that badly of holland , if they , having survived the group of death , had decided they did n't really need to see the squadra azzurra again so soon .
dutch integrity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie says the oranjes do n't have a b-team but the netherlands are known as a team that prioritizes the beautiful aspects of the beautiful game over merely getting results .
holland 's players bristled at the mere suggestion that , by resting its regular starters , the team was n't giving its all .
" this win speaks volumes , " said forward and goal-scorer robin van persie after the match .
" we do n't have a b-team .
we have a squad of 23 players . "
italy could have a chance to reward such dutch integrity by playing a fair match , should the two teams meet up in the semis .
in the meantime , football fans who like to see teams progress on their own merits alone should salute the netherlands with a rousing " hup holland hup ! " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

dw-world 's jefferson chase pays tribute to a side that stayed true to the spirit of fair competition . it 's a not very well kept secret that teams who qualify early in the group stages of major competitions sometimes look at the rest of the table when deciding how to play their final matches .
the bookmakers made holland the underdogs going into their game against romania on june 17 - the only conceivable reason being the idea that the netherlands might want to lose to prevent italy and france from progressing beyond group c. holland coach marco van basten was criticized for resting some of his regulars - a rational move which every team has a right to make when there 's nothing on the line for them .
and the netherlands showed great sportsmanship in downing the romanians 2-0 , a result that kept italy alive in the tournament .
not every team would have behaved so fairly .
legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .
and in order to avoid a repeat of that dully predictable encounter , soccer 's governing bodies ordered that subsequent final group matches be played simultaneously .
sportsmanship versus self-interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italisn fans knew whom they had to thank for survival but there 's no way to avoid all conflicts between sportsmanship and self-interest , as this year 's tournament showed a dutch loss to romania would have meant the end for reigning world champions italy , a team that 's often been accused of diving in the past and that knocked holland out of the 2000 euro .
and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .
few fans outside of italy would have thought that badly of holland , if they , having survived the group of death , had decided they did n't really need to see the squadra azzurra again so soon .
dutch integrity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie says the oranjes do n't have a b-team but the netherlands are known as a team that prioritizes the beautiful aspects of the beautiful game over merely getting results .
holland 's players bristled at the mere suggestion that , by resting its regular starters , the team was n't giving its all .
" this win speaks volumes , " said forward and goal-scorer robin van persie after the match .
" we do n't have a b-team .
we have a squad of 23 players . "
italy could have a chance to reward such dutch integrity by playing a fair match , should the two teams meet up in the semis .
in the meantime , football fans who like to see teams progress on their own merits alone should salute the netherlands with a rousing " hup holland hup ! " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany against irish pressure as eu meets in no vote shadow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could be banging its head against the wall over the result of the irish referendum the german government is firmly against applying pressure to ireland over the ratification of the eu 's reform treaty following the irish referendum last week .
the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .

" we have already achieved a lot in climate protection , " gabriel said .
" the kyoto goal has almost been reached .

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .
so current form as well as personnel issues could be the deciding factors .
ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .
russia get a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's arshavin is back on the pitch russian newspapers may have deemed the team 's 4-1 loss to spain a disgrace , but the russians generated a decent number of chances in that match .
and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .
but sweden 's tabloid newspaper aftonbladet did its best to stir up a bit of heat with an article playing on the stereotype of nouveau riche russians .
the story featured a picture of humble swedes staying in a camper van while the rich russkies whooped it up in a hotel room .

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany need strategic , personnel adjustments to beat portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can recover - with or without frings portugal are favored in the first euro 2008 quarter-final , after germany stumbled through the group stage .
but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .

and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .

russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 no clear favorite in sweden versus russia battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden fans are putting their hopes on a veteran squad with seven of the eight euro quarter-final spots settled , the only question is whether russia or sweden will claim the final place .
dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .
so current form as well as personnel issues could be the deciding factors .
ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .
russia get a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's arshavin is back on the pitch russian newspapers may have deemed the team 's 4-1 loss to spain a disgrace , but the russians generated a decent number of chances in that match .
and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .
but sweden 's tabloid newspaper aftonbladet did its best to stir up a bit of heat with an article playing on the stereotype of nouveau riche russians .
the story featured a picture of humble swedes staying in a camper van while the rich russkies whooped it up in a hotel room .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "

schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.06.2008 carmaker daimler sets up mercedes plant in low-cost hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes to produce its compact car models more cheaply in future daimler is investing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in a plant in hungary , making it the last major carmaker to set up shop in low-cost eastern europe and the move the single biggest foreign investment in hungary . the stuttgart-based carmaker said in a statement its mercedes-benz car unit would invest 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- to build the kecskemet plant near budapest , and would sign a memorandum of understanding with government officials there in the coming weeks .
the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .

dw-world 's jefferson chase pays tribute to a side that stayed true to the spirit of fair competition . it 's a not very well kept secret that teams who qualify early in the group stages of major competitions sometimes look at the rest of the table when deciding how to play their final matches .
the bookmakers made holland the underdogs going into their game against romania on june 17 - the only conceivable reason being the idea that the netherlands might want to lose to prevent italy and france from progressing beyond group c. holland coach marco van basten was criticized for resting some of his regulars - a rational move which every team has a right to make when there 's nothing on the line for them .
and the netherlands showed great sportsmanship in downing the romanians 2-0 , a result that kept italy alive in the tournament .
not every team would have behaved so fairly .
legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .
and in order to avoid a repeat of that dully predictable encounter , soccer 's governing bodies ordered that subsequent final group matches be played simultaneously .
sportsmanship versus self-interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italisn fans knew whom they had to thank for survival but there 's no way to avoid all conflicts between sportsmanship and self-interest , as this year 's tournament showed a dutch loss to romania would have meant the end for reigning world champions italy , a team that 's often been accused of diving in the past and that knocked holland out of the 2000 euro .
and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .
few fans outside of italy would have thought that badly of holland , if they , having survived the group of death , had decided they did n't really need to see the squadra azzurra again so soon .
dutch integrity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie says the oranjes do n't have a b-team but the netherlands are known as a team that prioritizes the beautiful aspects of the beautiful game over merely getting results .
holland 's players bristled at the mere suggestion that , by resting its regular starters , the team was n't giving its all .
" this win speaks volumes , " said forward and goal-scorer robin van persie after the match .
" we do n't have a b-team .
we have a squad of 23 players . "
italy could have a chance to reward such dutch integrity by playing a fair match , should the two teams meet up in the semis .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

the dutch meanwhile crushed romanian dreams . andrea pirlo and daniele de rossi scored for italy . the azzurri needed help from group winners the netherlands , who beat romania in berne by the same score , even though they played with a second-string side . klaas-jan huntelaar and robin van persie were the goal scorers for the oranjes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery suffered a broken leg in zurich , two-time champions france rushed from one disaster to the next as inspirational midfielder franck ribery was carried off with a suspected broken leg in the seventh minute . in the 25th minute , french defender eric abidal was sent off for a tackle in the area on luca toni , and pirlo made no mistake from the resulting spot kick . there was no coming back for the french , and de rossi 's 62nd-minute goal , which deflected off french captain thierry henry , made no difference as the french had been all but counted out at that stage already . love-stricken coach french coach raymond domenech , who is expected to be given the boot after the defeat , refused to comment on his future straight after the match when asked by french television , and instead proposed to his girlfriend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech just wants to get married now " i have nothing to say about my job , but i will say that i want to marry estelle , " domenech told m6 television just moments after the defeat . in berne , romania , who surprisingly went into their final game with a chance to advance to the quarter-finals , would have joined the dutch in the next round had they won . in a game in which dutch coach marco van basten played his second string , the opening goal was scored in the 54th minute by huntelaar from an ibrahim afellay cross . van persie added a second three minutes from the end with a well-taken shot from inside the area , after a defence-splitting pass found him in space .
the arsenal forward went around two defenders before unleashing a powerful strike . the games ahead the victory sees the netherlands win the group with nine points from their three victories , while italy are second on four points .
romania had two points , while two-time champions france will return home with just one point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be a litte early for the dutch to claim the title italy will face spain in the quarter-finals , while the netherlands will take on either russia or sweden . meanwhile , three-time champions germany , who on monday qualified for the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over austria , might be without midfielder torsten frings and coach joachim loew in their game thursday against portugal . an x-ray revealed that frings broke a rib in the game against austria , while loew is tentatively suspended for one game after being sent into the stands during the game in vienna . uefa announced tuesday that loew and his austrian counterpart , josef hickerberger , who was also sent off , will submit a written statement to the uefa disciplinary body . " the referee will also submit a report , and then the body will decide whether to scrap the suspension , leave it or increase it , " uefa communication manager william gaillard said . faithful greeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel 's love affair with greece is far from over meanwhile , defending champions greece , who have already been knocked out of the tournament , announced that german coach otto rehhagel will stay on as coach .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's rainer sollich the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's rainer sollich the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .
" years of treating european institutions as a convenient scapegoat leave fertile ground for populist campaigns , " he said .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "

demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's rainer sollich the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany need strategic , personnel adjustments to beat portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can recover - with or without frings portugal are favored in the first euro 2008 quarter-final , after germany stumbled through the group stage .
but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany against irish pressure as eu meets in no vote shadow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could be banging its head against the wall over the result of the irish referendum the german government is firmly against applying pressure to ireland over the ratification of the eu 's reform treaty following the irish referendum last week .
the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.06.2008 carmaker daimler sets up mercedes plant in low-cost hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes to produce its compact car models more cheaply in future daimler is investing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in a plant in hungary , making it the last major carmaker to set up shop in low-cost eastern europe and the move the single biggest foreign investment in hungary . the stuttgart-based carmaker said in a statement its mercedes-benz car unit would invest 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- to build the kecskemet plant near budapest , and would sign a memorandum of understanding with government officials there in the coming weeks .
the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .

daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .

as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

the bookmakers made holland the underdogs going into their game against romania on june 17 - the only conceivable reason being the idea that the netherlands might want to lose to prevent italy and france from progressing beyond group c. holland coach marco van basten was criticized for resting some of his regulars - a rational move which every team has a right to make when there 's nothing on the line for them .
and the netherlands showed great sportsmanship in downing the romanians 2-0 , a result that kept italy alive in the tournament .
not every team would have behaved so fairly .
legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .

and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .
few fans outside of italy would have thought that badly of holland , if they , having survived the group of death , had decided they did n't really need to see the squadra azzurra again so soon .
dutch integrity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie says the oranjes do n't have a b-team but the netherlands are known as a team that prioritizes the beautiful aspects of the beautiful game over merely getting results .
holland 's players bristled at the mere suggestion that , by resting its regular starters , the team was n't giving its all .
" this win speaks volumes , " said forward and goal-scorer robin van persie after the match .
" we do n't have a b-team .
we have a squad of 23 players . "
italy could have a chance to reward such dutch integrity by playing a fair match , should the two teams meet up in the semis .

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .

legal cheating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany and the austrians were n't so sporting in 1982 it 's an unwritten rule in football that teams should try to do their best to win every match , regardless of group standings .
but football history abounds with examples of squads colluding with their opponents to achieve mutually beneficial results .
one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .

and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .
few fans outside of italy would have thought that badly of holland , if they , having survived the group of death , had decided they did n't really need to see the squadra azzurra again so soon .

" this win speaks volumes , " said forward and goal-scorer robin van persie after the match .
" we do n't have a b-team .

italy could have a chance to reward such dutch integrity by playing a fair match , should the two teams meet up in the semis .

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .
so current form as well as personnel issues could be the deciding factors .
ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .
russia get a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's arshavin is back on the pitch russian newspapers may have deemed the team 's 4-1 loss to spain a disgrace , but the russians generated a decent number of chances in that match .
and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .
but sweden 's tabloid newspaper aftonbladet did its best to stir up a bit of heat with an article playing on the stereotype of nouveau riche russians .
the story featured a picture of humble swedes staying in a camper van while the rich russkies whooped it up in a hotel room .

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .

ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .

russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany need strategic , personnel adjustments to beat portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can recover - with or without frings portugal are favored in the first euro 2008 quarter-final , after germany stumbled through the group stage .
but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2008 eu presses ahead with treaty ratification despite irish " no " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that thick pile called " lisbon " will be on the table waiting for eu lawmakers at the summit ahead of a summit in brussels , the european union called wednesday for the ratification process of the lisbon treaty to continue despite its crushing rejection by irish voters last week . a planned two-day european union summit which opens on thursday , june 19 , meant to focus on weighty topics such as rising oil prices is likely to be overshadowed by the institutional crisis plaguing the bloc after irish voters last week resoundingly rejected the lisbon treaty .
ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche hopes to gain a competitive edge with daimler 's hungary investment " mercedes-benz is going to offer an even wider range of exciting premium cars with the high levels of comfort , safety and overall quality that are characteristic of the brand in the particularly fuel-efficient compact-car segment , " said dieter zetsche , the company 's chief executive .
" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .
daimler 's rivals have long been splashing out in the region .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the most infamous was germany and austria 's group match at the 1982 world cup in spain - nicknamed the " non-aggression pact of gijon . "
with germany needing a win to progress , and austria having only to avoid defeat by three goals , the teams both stopped trying to score after the germans went up 1-0 in the eleventh minute .
this instance of " legal cheating " was so crass that the journalist assigned to commentate on the match for german public television refused to talk about it during the second half .

and the netherlands had even more incentive to tank tuesday 's game since , owing to the uefa nonsensical match-up system , the italians are a potential semifinal opponent of the oranjes .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's rainer sollich the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .

versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .

whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handing out the treaty to irish voters was not a bad idea - but who really read it and understood it ?
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the sceptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa said on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
barroso hits out at eu members barroso suggested the irish referendum had been hijacked by misplaced fears and he took a swipe at eu member nations - which hold the real power in europe - who blame the eu institutions for their political woes at home .

ireland plunged the european union into chaos last week when 53 percent of voters rejected the treaty meant to streamline the bloc 's cumbersome institutions and to make it more efficient after a recent eastward expansion .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat told news agency dpa .
irish rejection clouds summit yet despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
european commission president jose manuel barroso called on the eu heads of state and government to take time at thursday and friday 's summit in brussels to find a consensus together with ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish voters were emphatic in their rejection of the lisbon treaty " we must work very closely with the irish government to help solve this problem , " barroso told members of the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday after being harangued by a group of deputies wearing green sweat shirts emblazoned : " respect the irish vote . "
but the social democrats warned of a " crisis of trust " in eu institutions .
it was worrying that all the major irish parties had called for a yes vote and the electorate had still voted no , social democrat faction leader martin schulz said .
german calls for removal of irish commissioner on wednesday , schulz called for irish eu commissioner charlie mccreevy to be removed from his post , accusing him of contributing to ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .
" mr mccreevy , responsible for the internal market , seen as a threat by european citizens , said he had not read the lisbon treaty , " german martin schulz , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" how van you create confidence with this kind of behavior ? " a visibly angry schulz said .
ireland was the only eu member that held a popular vote to approve the treaty , as required by the country 's constitution .
so far , 18 of the 27 eu parliaments have approved the treaty , with britain 's upper house due to vote later wednesday .
all 27 member states have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect .
members of the unelected upper chamber , the house of lords were to debate the lisbon treaty for the third and final time , as part of the ratification process that prime minister gordon brown insists must continue .
which way forward ?
no one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what irish prime minister brian cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .

but if the germans make a few key changes , they could upset cristiano ronaldo and co . germany coach joachim loew wo n't be on the sidelines after picking a one-game suspension for a minor referee fracas .
but he can do more to help the squad before the match than during it .
germany 's main worry against the portugese , who qualified easily in group a , has to be slowing the offensive momentum of ronaldo , deco and portugal 's other attackers .
obviously , to have a chance , germany will need to play with more passion and precision than they did against either croatia or austria .
but a few alterations in strategy and personnel would n't hurt either .
get the defense sorted bildunterschrift : german defenders need to be very attentive to this man with marcell jansen now likely removed from the starting back four , it 's time for loew to address germany 's other main defensive deficit - central defender christoph metzelder .
coming off injury , metzelder has looked too slow and cumbersome to be of much use against portugal 's speedy strikers , but germany have some options .
one would be to move arne friedrich , who was decent against austria , into the middle - a position he often plays for his club hertha berlin .
in that case , clemens fritz , whose pace might help him against ronaldo , could be switched to right back .
another would be to promote heiko westermann , who had a fine season with schalke , to the starting eleven .
security at back is essential for germany to avoid getting pinned in their own half and help address another of the squad 's problems .
linking back and front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could use a more aggressive ballack against poland in their first group match , germany were able to control the midfield and generate chances with their short passing game .
versus croatia there was little link-up between defense and attack - a problem that needs to be addressed .
a cracked rib could keep torsten frings out of the line-up , but loew could voluntarily rest the bremen midfielder , who has been ineffectual at freeing up captain michael ballack for forays into the opponent 's half .
a possible replacement would be thomas hitzlsperger , whose high-velocity long-distance shot earned him the nickname " der hammer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger looks set to return to the starting eleven another option would be simon rolfes .
he had eight goals for leverkusen this year despite playing a classic stopper position in front of the back four .
whatever tack germany decide to take , their midfield needs to keep far enough up the field to be able to supply their strikers .
thus , loew will almost definitely give the offensively minded bastian schweinsteiger , who 's coming off a one-match ban , his first start of the tournament .
the best way to stop cristiano ronaldo is to prevent him from getting the ball , and the best way to do that is keep the ball yourself .
ace in the hole ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann could get a chance to repeat his 2006 heroics germany wo n't make its starting line-up known until shortly before the match .
but loew would probably like to move up lukas podolski , germany 's leading goal-scorer thus far , and replace mario gomez , who seems to have completely lost confidence .
but podolski is also ailing so gomez may get a chance at redemption .
a few more opportunities in the form of precise passes and crosses from germany 's midfield might help gomez and strike partner miroslav klose find their rhythm .
and if germany can score first , they have an even chance of at least getting a draw - and at reaching a stage of the match at which germans are historically very good .
germany are 5-1 in penalty shoot-outs in international competitions - with their most recent win coming against argentina , a side very similar to portugal , in the 2006 world cup .
portugal are no slouches in this area , either .
they 're 2-0 in penalty shoot-outs , winning most recently against england at the 2006 world cup , with keeper ricardo saving three to send portugal through .
still , for an out-of-form germany , just getting to a shoot-out would be a triumph against the odds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.06.2008 opinion : mideast peace still very elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has accepted an egyptian-brokered truce with hamas islamists ruling the gaza strip and plans to open peace talks with lebanon .
deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "

demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .

schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the truce is due to take effect at 6 am -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- thursday , following which israel is expected to ease crossing restrictions after 24 hours .
israel imposed a blockade of the gaza strip in response to near-daily rocket and mortar attacks on its southern towns and villages and tightened it after hamas seized sole control of gaza in june 2007 .
jaeger said the german government hoped the truce is adhered to by all palestinian groups in gaza and that missile attacks against israeli targets are halted .
" germany welcomes every agreement that has the goal of stopping bloodshed , " said the spokesman , who also thanked egypt for its efforts in bringing about the ceasefire .
the terms of the truce also cover indirect negotiations on a prisoners exchange that would include the release of an israeli soldier held captive by hamas for the past two years . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 18.06.2008 eu backs controversial rules for expelling illegal migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping to deter future immigrants to take the illegal path to the bloc eu lawmakers voted wednesday , june 18 , for a new set of common rules for expelling illegal immigrants from the 27-nation bloc despite widespread criticism by human rights groups . eu lawmakers approved the law which allows illegal immigrants to be detained for up to 18 months despite vocal opposition from rights groups and socialists , greens and other lawmakers in the european parliament .
the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de looks ahead at the two teams ' do-or-die clash in innsbruck , austria . with good reason , bookmakers were offering roughly the same odds on the two northern european football sides before their final group d match .
sweden have a slight advantage in that their better goal difference would mean they would progress in case of a draw .
russia , on the other hand , is slightly ahead historically - they 've won eight of the two teams ' previous encounters to sweden 's seven .
sweden know what it 's like to get to the euro quarter-finals - they did so in the last tournament in 2004 .
but russia have youth on their side .
the average age of their squad is just over 26 , compared with more than 29 for the swedes .

ibrahimovic worries bildunterschrift : sweden hopes zlatan will be flying high again against russia a fan favorite in past years , sweden have created few highlights this time round .
their 2-0 win over greece was one of the dreariest matches of the tournament , and they did little but defend when they lost to spain on saturday .
two of sweden 's mainstays - midfielder freddie ljungberg and striker henrik larsson - are well into their thirties and appear to have lost a step .
and they have injuries worries as well , after forward zlatan ibrahimovic was unable to practice with a gimpy knee .
ibrahimovic is sweden 's most potent offensive threat , having scored two of the team 's three goals ion the tournament thus far .
should he be unable to play , his likely replacement would be werder bremen striker markus rosenberg , but he 's yet to show he can generate much of the threat at this level .

and they comfortably handled greece , scoring the only goal they needed in the first half .
russia will also be welcoming back playmaker andrei arshavin , who returns from a two-game suspension .
arshavin was the man of the match in his club side zenit st. peterburg 's win in this year 's uefa cup final , and the fleet-footed russian had three goals and five assists in the euro qualifiers .
russia 's dutch coach guus hiddink also has a good record with outsiders in major competitions , having gotten south korea through the final four in the 2002 world cup .
fishy affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " caviar kids " have recovered nicely from their opening loss to spain the match-up has n't attracted a lot of attention outside the two countries concerned , and both the swedish and russian press have generally restrained themselves to expressions of cautious optimism .
but sweden 's tabloid newspaper aftonbladet did its best to stir up a bit of heat with an article playing on the stereotype of nouveau riche russians .

the probe focuses in particular on two cash injections in 2002 and 2004 .
the commission , europe 's top competition watchdog , said it would also scrutinize fees at the airport and in particular individual contracts with irish low-cost airline ryanair which is the biggest carrier at the airport .
german airline lufthansa has complained in the past that ryanair benefitted from reduced take-off and landing fees at the airport , arguing that it amounted to an illegal state subsidy .
hahn airport , which is located around 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- southwest of frankfurt , is 65-percent owned by frankfurt airport operator fraport , while the regional state authorities of hesse and rhineland-palatinate hold 17.5 percent apiece .
ryainair has one of its biggest european hubs at the hahn airport .
the economy ministry in rhineland-palatinate said it had submitted a comprehensive report to the european commission which showed that both fraport and hahn had behaved like " market-driven private investors .

deutsche welle 's rainer sollich reflects on what these overtures actually mean . the truce between israel and hamas can be interpreted cynically - shooting is allowed until the ceasefire takes effect on early thursday morning , june 19 .
a few militant palestinians seem to have read this literally by firing self-made rockets into israeli territory on tuesday evening . # b # the incidents demonstrate the fragility of all current peace efforts and confidence-building measures between israel and its arab neighbors .
a host of uncertainties plague the israeli side too .
it remains unclear how long israeli premier ehud olmert , facing corruption allegations , can remain in office as he fights for his political survival .
but the real problems related to the palestinians , syria and lebanon are much too complex to be solved with a short-term fix to israel 's internal tangles .
the country has to constantly reckon with possible setbacks in the middle east that could pile on further pressure on olmert .
and the israeli leader is hardly riding a popularity wave with his peace initiatives - in the past months , the israeli population 's approval of negotiations with hamas or of a handover to syria of the golan heights captured in 1967 has been sinking .
the egyptian-brokered ceasefire between israel and hamas has significantly enhanced the standing of the so far widely isolated islamists and has indirectly weakened palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement .
the next few days will show whether both sides really want to and can implement the agreements .
there are a number of possibilities : hamas could use a ceasefire and a partial opening of the gaza strip to stock up its military arsenal and could in addition give way to other armed groups .
or the islamists could also seize the chance to take real political responsibility for the fate of the people in the gaza strip and find a gradual way out of their international isolation .
at the moment , one can only hope for the latter .
but it remains a fact that any future israeli-palestinian peace agreement would have no chance of succeeding if hamas were not to be involved in it .
israeli peace talks with lebanon , if they ever took place , would by no means be any less complex given the complex territorial issues at hand and the large palestinian refugee camp in lebanon that would hugely complicate any peace deal .
as expected , lebanon 's current negotiations to form a government , made up of pro-western and pro-syrian forces , are difficult .
but the bitter losses of the war with israel in 2006 have united lebanese of all political stripes .
none of the feuding lebanese politicians can allow a demonstrative readiness to compromise with israel - that would amount to political self-destruction .
hezbollah , which is part of the new government , in fact justifies its existence largely on account of its armed struggle against israel .
one can only hope for a successful conclusion of the so far indirect peace talks between israel and syria though it 's likely to be a long time before that happens .
yet there are signs that syrian president bashar al-assad wants to carefully open up his country and move away from his one-sided dependence on iran .
but al-assad is known for his unpredictability and his sly tactics .
he would probably even demand a price from the us in the form of economic aid or a guarantee to continue with his dictatorship in return for a comprehensive peace treaty with israel .
the conclusion ?
things are stirring in the middle east , they 're moving in the right direction but the outcome is anybody 's guess .

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .

" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .
slovenia 's interior minister dragutin mate had warned lawmakers that if they rejected the text it would take several more years to reach an agreement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new factory will " boost competitiveness , and access new markets , " as well as create up to 2,500 new jobs , daimler said .
carmaker hopes to export to us hoping the cheap production in hungary will help it to compete with fuel-efficient car rivals from germany , korea and japan , daimler plans to add two models to its compact car line-up , bringing the number of compact vehicles to four .
the company said it would also invest 600 million euros in its rastatt car plant in southwest germany to improve production there for the long-term .

" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .

" moreover , our expanded product range will allow us to tap into new customer groups and open up new market regions , " zetsche said .
but it 's not just the eastern european market that daimler hopes to tap with its new hungarian plant .
a spokesman for the company told news agency reuters that the company was also eyeing exports to north america given that fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines were becoming increasingly popular in the us in light of spiraling oil prices .
so far , exporting compact cars to the us was hampered by high manufacturing costs and a strong euro , the company spokesman said .
since the beginning of the year , daimler has begun selling its new model of the smart car in some us cities .
single-biggest investment daimler 's investment has been welcomed by the hungarian government .
prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said wednesday the plant broke all investment records in the country .
" daimler 's decision represents the biggest single investment in hungary 's history , " gyurcsany told a special news conference held in parliament .
the previous record had been set by south korean tire manufacturer hanook with a 500-million-euro plant in 2005 .
" the factory will provide employment for 2,500 people and will indirectly create 10,000 more jobs as suppliers , " gyurcsany said , adding the investment would provide a valuable boost to the country 's economy .
hungary produced 289,000 cars and 2.4 million engines in 2007 .
this year it expects to manufacture 366,000 cars and 2.5 million engines . among the brands currently being built in hungary are audi , opel , fiat , and suzuki .
daimler can hope to capitalize on hourly wages of five euros in hungary and solid infrastructure which links its kecskement plant to its rastatt factory in germany via a highway .
the carmaker , which hopes to manufacture 100,000 vehicles a year in hungary , said the eastern european country had edged out poland and romania to bag the daimler contract because of its cheap labor costs and skilled manpower .
daimler last to enter eastern europe daimler is the only major carmaker in the world without a production base in eastern europe , where demand for cars is growing as the region 's economies surge and where labor costs are significantly lower than in western europe .

the measures were adopted in strasbourg by 367 votes to 206 with 109 abstentions .
the proposed law had been the topic of debate for over three years and edged closer to the final hurdle earlier this month when european union interior ministers agreed on measures to allow detention without trial and introduce an automatic re-entry ban of up to five years for illegal immigrants .
european commission estimates say there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the bloc . more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 but less than 90,000 were eventually expelled .
supporters say that the law is needed to make the bloc 's migration policies credible , a stance backed by conservative and liberal lawmakers .
" it 's a decisive step towards a necessary common policy on immigration , an essential legal instrument to safeguard fundamental rights for immigrants , " said spanish conservative agustin diaz de mera garcia .
critics demand a reduced detention period while conservatives and liberals supported the controversial law in a parliamentary debate on tuesday , giving the text a theoretical majority , socialists , greens and a communist-led groups voiced concern over the measures and demanded a reduction of the detention length .
the 18-month limit is higher than the maximum detention in two-thirds of the 27 eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegals will be detained in special centers - not jails currently , illegal migrants can not be detained for more than 40 days in spain and a year in hungary , according to european commission data .
germany already has an 18-month detention cap , while eight eu countries , who have higher caps or none at all would need to introduce the new eu limit .
meanwhile , human rights groups called for the complete scrapping of the proposal .
the draft guidelines which were agreed ahead of the vote say that illegal immigrants in the 27 member countries can be held in specialized detention centers - not jails - for no more than 18 months before being expelled from the bloc .
the guidelines grant them basic rights including access to free legal advice , food and shelter , and prohibit the expulsion or detention of unaccompanied children .
children to be detained under proposed law however , the law does allow children to be detained alongside parents and guardians while saying that should be for the shortest appropriate period of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say that europe is shutting itself down " this directive is a disgrace , it 's an insult to civilization in europe , " said italian left-winger giusto catania , saying illegal migrants should not be detained for 18 months without having committed a crime .
" we are building a europe which is shutting down on itself , " said fellow socialist martine roure , urging the bloc to take steps to facilitate legal migration .
amnesty international 's secretary general , irene khan , had urged lawmakers to reject the text .
" the proposed directive is unacceptable as an eu standard , " she said in a statement .
" detention should only be used in very exceptional cases , always for the shortest possible time . "
however , the possibility of the proposal being dragged out for an even longer time could convince some of those who are undecided .

the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2008 germany against irish pressure as eu meets in no vote shadow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could be banging its head against the wall over the result of the irish referendum the german government is firmly against applying pressure to ireland over the ratification of the eu 's reform treaty following the irish referendum last week .
the " no " vote is likely to to dominate the eu summer summit . speaking ahead of the eu summit in brussels which runs for thursday and friday , the german officials said ireland had to be given time to analyze and assess the situation .
" we are not going to point a pistol at them , " a high-ranking source said .
" we must give the irish government time to consult . "
irish prime minister brian cowen is expected to provide an initial analysis of the situation when eu heads of state and government meet over supper in brussels on thursday .
the german government sources would not be drawn on deadlines for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , hammered out last year in an attempt to replace the failed constitutional process .
" it depends on the irish ...
the irish must tell us what they would rather have - nice or something else , " they said in reference to the 2001 treaty of nice , agreed before the large-scale expansion of the eu into formerly communist eastern europe .
eu leaders regard the arrangements under the treaty of nice as too cumbersome for an eu grown to 27 members .
the sources would not be drawn on the ratification process in other eu countries where potential problems loom , such as the czech republic and poland .
ratification is being held up in germany by a legal challenge laid before the constitutional court .
ratification by britain - the upper house of the british parliament is expected to pass the required legislation late wednesday - would give the process across europe a boost , they said .
chancellor angela merkel is to address the german parliament on the issue early thursday before leaving for brussels .
eu says no issues will be eclipsed by ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's face belies the discomfort the eu feels the eu leaders gathering at the summit are meant to discuss matters of real concern for real people , while thousands of truckers and farmers gather outside their meeting room to vent their anger at surging oil prices .
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , who will act as chair for the last time as president of the european union , insists that " not a single item has been dropped from the official agenda because of what happened in ireland . "
" leaders will want to show that they are paying attention to what matters to consumers , which is oil and food prices , " one diplomat points out .
eu heads of government and state are understandably keen not to appear fiddling while rome burns .
but despite their best intentions , eu leaders will inevitably focus on the institutional chaos sparked by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty during the regular summer summit in brussels .
the original plan was for german chancellor merkel to address her colleagues over dinner and outline the job descriptions of the new posts being created by the treaty : a president of the european council , representing national governments , and a high representative in charge of the bloc 's foreign and security policy .
treaty appointments give way ro referendum autopsy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen will address the eu with a report on the irish vote instead , that discussion is likely to be sidelined by the presentation from irish prime minister cowen , who will be asked to explain why he allowed his countrymen to throw such a huge spanner into the works of the eu .
this is the first time that eu leaders are meeting since the referendum in ireland .
designed to make the expanded 27-member bloc more efficient and more influential on the world stage , the treaty is supposed to replace a planned european constitution , which was itself rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
after the treaty 's approval in october , british prime minister gordon brown proudly proclaimed that europe was at last free to " move away from the institutional inward-looking debate of the past " and deal with real problems like jobs , globalization and climate change .
exactly eight months later , brown and his colleagues are reluctantly finding themselves dwelling on the same issues they hoped they had left behind .
no-one quite knows how to pull the eu out of its latest institutional quagmire .
diplomats say leaders will listen carefully to what cowen has to say , and will then take time to think things over .
confusion cited as reason for " no " vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaked reports suggest ireland voted out of confusion according to leaked results of an eu survey published on tuesday by the irish independent , many of the people who voted no in the referendum did so either because they did not understand the treaty , or because they had other concerns , such as immigration and unemployment .
moreover , 70 percent of those who rejected the treaty thought it could be easily renegotiated .
this is not the case , and diplomats say no quick fixes are in sight .
one possible solution is for ireland to be granted a number of concessions before being asked to vote again , either in the autumn or early next year .
in the meantime , leaders have called for the remaining eight national parliaments to ratify the treaty - the latest to do so could be britain on wednesday evening - and have avoided talking about a " two-speed europe , " whereby some member states would go ahead with further integration , leaving the skeptics behind .
" we want to continue with a one-speed europe , " jansa insisted on tuesday .
the slovenian premier has been playing down the impact of the irish vote , pointing out that the euro rose against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote .
he wants thursday and friday 's summit to stick to the original agenda .
food , fuel hikes and world poverty still on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel price hikes have prompted strikes across europe high up in the order of business is a discussion on rising petrol prices .
leaders want to monitor prices in order to reduce speculation , improve energy efficiency and increase transparency on the oil markets .
" the days of low energy prices are over , " jansa explained .
as regards food prices , the eu is pointing its finger at rising demand from rapidly-developing nations such as china and india , and insists that its use of biofuels is not to blame .
" only two per cent of the eu surface that could be intended for food is now used for biofuels , so this can not be the reason -lrb- for rising food prices -rrb- , " the slovenian premier argued .
again , no-one is expecting the problem of expensive food to be resolved overnight , and the summit will not even attempt to do so .
leaders will instead express deep concern about the situation in zimbabwe , they will officially welcome slovakia into the eu 's common currency area , and they will reiterate their pledge to do more to help the starving masses of the world .
" there is important stuff on the agenda , apart from the irish referendum , " a british diplomat said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schrimm , who heads germany 's special office for prosecuting holocaust crimes , said " our view is that a conviction can be attained under german criminal law . "
fifteen years ago israel 's supreme court ruled there was a reasonable doubt whether demjanjuk had been a sadistic guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " and quashed his 1988 death sentence .
a race against time for convictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's now a race against time to prosecute before survivors die although demjanjuk has escaped hanging , the simon wiesenthal center lists him at number two on its wanted list of 10 top nazi war criminals .
demjanjuk asserts he served with a nazi unit in ukraine but not at the extermination camp .
schrimm , the german nazi hunter , is in a race against time to catch the last nazi-era criminals before they die .
his office in ludwigshafen has extensive files , and said they would apply within two months to the german high court for demjanjuk to be extradited .
the high court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case , as german courts are normally only responsible for crimes committed by germans or inside germany .
according to schrimm , however , german connections were enough .
" a significant number of victims came from germany and demjanjuk performed functions for germany , " he said .
demjanjuk could be described as an official of nazi germany , the prosecutor said , adding that he felt " a certain satisfaction " at the prospect of leading such a trial before all the suspects and witnesses had passed away .
demjanjuk emigrated to the united states in 1951 and has recently had his us citizenship revoked .
since then , no country has offered to take him . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as vacant lots sprout new buildings , there 's concern that it has become easy to forget the role berlin played in the cold war . a group of famous politicians and diplomats has proposed building a museum at checkpoint charlie , a us military crossing that has become a symbol for the separation which existed between the soviet bloc and western europe . several prominent figures have signed on , urging the german and berlin state governments to build a cold war museum , according to a report in the tuesday , june 17 edition of sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the signers include former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher , former polish foreign minister vladyslav bartoszevski , czechoslovakia ’ s former president vaclav havel , the american diplomat john kornblum and the former head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- hans-jochen vogel , among others . remembering a changed city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie has become a tourist attraction the world has changed so drastically in the two decades since the end of the cold war that it 's important to have a museum that will remind future generations of the struggle , the signers said .
the museum is seen as a place where people can learn about the " mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation . " germany minister of culture bernd neumann will meet on wednesday , june 18 to discuss the best way to commemorate the cold war .
spd parliamentarian markus meckel , who also signed the document , said he believes the cold war museum would fit perfectly into neumann 's plans . an unused piece of land is still available near the checkpoint , but meckel , who was a dissident in east germany and the country 's last foreign minister after the first free elections in 1990 , told the newspaper that the government will need to act fast if it wants to keep the spot from being developed for other purposes . there is also the museum haus am checkpoint charlie , which tells the 28-year history of the berlin wall mostly through the stories of thousands of daring attempts to escape to the west .
the museum has approximately 800,000 visitors each year , showing there 's a big interest in this part of berlin 's history . " berlin was the symbol of the division not only in germany but in europe and the world , " meckel was quoted as saying .
" if you want to understand the separation in europe in the second half of the 20th century , where should you do it if not in berlin ? " famous supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel has put his support behind a cold war museum the signees make up a veritable who 's who of cold war diplomacy . genscher , 81 , left east germany at the beginning of the cold war and join west germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he served as west germany 's foreign minister from roughly 1974 to 1992 , during which time he helped shape the government 's ostpolitik , which was a policy of deescalating tensions with the communist east germany . havel , a writer and playwright , was swept into power in czechoslovakia by 1989 's " velvet revolution . "
he oversaw the country 's transition to multi-party democracy , its break with slovakia and negotiations to enter the european union . long-time spd member vogel was the leader of the social democrats between 1987 and 1991 . john kornblum served various us foreign service posts in germany starting in 1964 and was the us ambassador to germany between 1997 and 2001 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , engineers studying corrosion on the bridge said the cables may be deteriorating more slowly than previously feared .
it had been thought weight limits on the crossing could be needed as early as 2014 but latest findings suggest a date of between 2017 and 2021 .
a dehumidification system is also being installed to help combat the corrosion .
the first internal inspection in 2004 revealed that the main cables had lost about 8 % of their strength and work got under way to fully assess the problem .
further tests by the forth estuary transport authority 's consultant engineers have indicated a 10 % drop , but suggest the deterioration is at the slower end of expectations . "
the worst case scenario of an hgv ban in 2014 now looks unlikely " barry colford feta bridgemaster barry colford , feta chief engineer and bridgemaster , said the findings represented the best possible professional assessment using the best available data .
he said : " until now we only had two points on the graph - 1964 when the bridge was built and the inspection in 2004 .
" in the absence of data from the intervening years , it was hard to precisely determine when the corrosion had started and how quickly it was progressing .
we now have a third point on the graph , which has allowed our consulting engineers to predict the future rate of deterioration with more confidence .
" the good news is that , although the cables are still losing strength , the worst case scenario of an hgv ban in 2014 now looks unlikely . "
in the inspection work , hardwood wedges were driven in to open up the cables , allowing engineers to assess the condition of a representative sample of the 11,618 individual wires which make up each bundle .
the condition of each wire was carefully recorded and samples taken for laboratory testing .
tensile tests , chemical analyses and corrosion analyses were carried out on selected sample wires .
feta said the new inspection findings provided an updated benchmark for measuring efforts to halt the corrosion , with a third inspection to be carried out in 2011/12 .
precautionary checks are also being carried out on the bridge 's anchorages , where the main cables are attached to post-tensioned concrete-filled tunnels bored into the rock in each shore , to make sure there are no hidden problems .

some 20,000 demonstrators from moquegua have been demanding a greater share of the taxes paid to the government by peru 's biggest copper producer .
the catholic church had given refuge to the men and they were released unharmed .
they are now flying to lima .
among those held by the protestors was the chief of police in southern peru .
blockade twenty-four hours after they were taken hostage by angry protesters in moquegua , 1,200km -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- south of lima , the 48 police officers were released safely .
among them , the chief of police for southern peru , alberto jordan , who was shown earlier on national television surrounded by a crowd , waving a white flag and apologising to the people .
the officers were captured after they tried to disperse protesters blocking a bridge with tear gas , which seemed to provoke them further .
the crowd charged the officers , disarmed them and marched them to the city 's cathedral where they were held .
what started as a few thousand protesters blocking roads in and out of the southernmost tip of peru swelled during the course of the week to a crowd of around 20,000 people .
the peruvian authorities were forced to ship in food and fuel by sea .
the demonstrators say they want a larger share of the taxes which the operators of the local mine , southern copper , pays the central government .
copper prices have soared on the world market and mining companies in peru are making huge profits .
the government had suspended talks with local leaders until the hostages were freed .
now the negotiations will resume .
mining is powering peru 's economy and president alan garcia is under pressure to deliver the benefits of the growth to the poor .
the longer he delays the more protests like this will continue to paralyse parts of the country .

carbofuran is a very powerful and toxic insecticide .
spread in the soil , it destroys bugs in the ground and is taken up by plants and kills insects which feed on the sap or foliage .
it is so powerful and toxic that it has been banned in europe .
in the united states it can not be used in granular form , and the us environmental protection agency is seeking a total ban .
but in kenya , carbofuran can be bought across the counter without restriction .
according to world-famous naturalist dr richard leakey , it is being bought not by farmers wanting to control bugs and insects , but mainly by herdsmen who use it to kill lions , leopards and other predators .
among the latest incidents two lions were poisoned and killed in the maasai mara game reserve after eating the carcass of a hippo that had ingested carbofuran .
put down vets and wildlife rangers were called to watch the pathetic sight of the lions staggering and weakened from the effects of the poison . "
-lrb- carbofuran has -rrb- become known in rural communities in kenya as an easy way to get rid of predators " naturalist richard leakey one of the lions was shot to bring a quick end to its suffering .
another lion died a few months ago from carbofuran poisoning on a private ranch in laikipia .
in november last year , a dead camel was apparently found laced with carbofuran near lewa wildlife conservancy .
the result was the death of at least two lions and 15 vultures which feasted on the carcass .
also near lewa , several lions from the nearby samburu wildlife reserve were poisoned ; again , it is thought carbofuran was responsible .
there are many other cases throughout kenya of predators dying after eating meat contaminated with the chemical .
dr leakey says carbofuran is " deadly poisonous " and he has called for it to be banned in kenya .
" it 's become known in rural communities in kenya as an easy way to get rid of predators : lions , leopards and hyenas , " he says .
dr leakey says his research shows that furadan , the trade name of the biggest-selling carbofuran insecticide in kenya , is being bought not by farmers but by pastoralists who do not have any land for growing crops , and use the chemical to kill lions and leopards which threaten their herds .
there is no record for the number of predators killed in kenya by poisoning , but many naturalists believe carbofuran is responsible for thousands of deaths , not just of big cats but all carrion eaters . "

he gives the example of 187 vultures that died when they fed on a carcass of an animal that was apparently laced with the deadly poison in an area by the athi river .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement one of the lions before it succumbed to the poison environmentalists in kenya are worried that an insecticide is being used by farmers to kill lions and other predators .
carbofuran is a very powerful and toxic insecticide .
spread in the soil , it destroys bugs in the ground and is taken up by plants and kills insects which feed on the sap or foliage .
it is so powerful and toxic that it has been banned in europe .
in the united states it can not be used in granular form , and the us environmental protection agency is seeking a total ban .
but in kenya , carbofuran can be bought across the counter without restriction .
according to world-famous naturalist dr richard leakey , it is being bought not by farmers wanting to control bugs and insects , but mainly by herdsmen who use it to kill lions , leopards and other predators .
among the latest incidents two lions were poisoned and killed in the maasai mara game reserve after eating the carcass of a hippo that had ingested carbofuran .
put down vets and wildlife rangers were called to watch the pathetic sight of the lions staggering and weakened from the effects of the poison .
-lrb- carbofuran has -rrb- become known in rural communities in kenya as an easy way to get rid of predators naturalist richard leakey one of the lions was shot to bring a quick end to its suffering .
another lion died a few months ago from carbofuran poisoning on a private ranch in laikipia .
in november last year , a dead camel was apparently found laced with carbofuran near lewa wildlife conservancy .
the result was the death of at least two lions and 15 vultures which feasted on the carcass .
also near lewa , several lions from the nearby samburu wildlife reserve were poisoned ; again , it is thought carbofuran was responsible .
there are many other cases throughout kenya of predators dying after eating meat contaminated with the chemical .
dr leakey says carbofuran is " deadly poisonous " and he has called for it to be banned in kenya .
" it 's become known in rural communities in kenya as an easy way to get rid of predators : lions , leopards and hyenas , " he says .
dr leakey says his research shows that furadan , the trade name of the biggest-selling carbofuran insecticide in kenya , is being bought not by farmers but by pastoralists who do not have any land for growing crops , and use the chemical to kill lions and leopards which threaten their herds .
there is no record for the number of predators killed in kenya by poisoning , but many naturalists believe carbofuran is responsible for thousands of deaths , not just of big cats but all carrion eaters .
i literally saw vultures dropping out of the sky vulture expert simon thomsett simon thomsett , a world renowned expert on vultures , eagles and other birds of prey , says there has been a " dramatic drop-off in the number of birds of prey in the past few years " , and the finger of blame is being pointed at carbofuran .
he gives the example of 187 vultures that died when they fed on a carcass of an animal that was apparently laced with the deadly poison in an area by the athi river .
simon thomsett says the poison can not be detected when sprinkled on the carcass and is very fast to act .
" i literally saw vultures dropping out of the sky just a few minutes after they had eaten the poisoned meat , " he said .
easy to buy carbofuran comes in granular form , tiny dust-like purple pellets .
i went into several agricultural merchants in the capital , nairobi , and found it easy to buy .
vultures have died after feeding on laced carcasses three shops said it posed no health threat to animals or humans .
" it 's safe , it 's perfectly safe , " one shop assistant told me .
others warned it was poisonous and one shop-keeper even described carbofuran as a " lion-killer " .
the container warns that it should be kept " locked away out of reach of children " , but there is not a word on the label about a potential threat to wildlife .
kenya 's pest control and products board is carrying out research into carbofuran 's dangers and toxicity , and say it is too early to come to a conclusion .
dr leakey says the evidence is there for all to see .
his worries are shared by thomas manyibe , a vet with the kenya wildlife service who carried out post-mortem tests on the lions that were killed in the masai mara .
he says evidence shows that carbofuran is being used to target lions and leopards .
i spoke to pastoralists who said they had heard that furadan was used to kill big cats .
on the edge of the maasai mara a young herdsman , ndigwa , said he lost many cows every year to lions and leopards , but he said he would never resort to poison to take revenge on the predators .
we take stewardship of our products very seriously and condemn any intentional baiting misuse of carbofuran fmc corporation the masai on the escarpment above the mara reserve know that a healthy , abundant population of predators is important to their livelihoods , derived in part from income from tourists coming to watch the game ; and there is no suggestion at all that they have been involved in trying to poison lions .
others do not hesitate .
carbofuran comes from a number of different overseas suppliers , but the main producer is the us firm fmc corporation .
the company said in a statement : " we take stewardship of our products very seriously and condemn any intentional baiting misuse of carbofuran .
" fmc is very concerned about reports of carbofuran -lrb- furadan -rrb- being used to bait lions in kenya and we have offered our services to the kenya pest control products board in their investigation . "
concerns about the use of carbofuran are not new .
fifteen years ago there were a number of cases of mass killings of birds in western kenya ; what is lacking is a comprehensive record of predators killed by poisoning .
there is lots of circumstantial evidence but few hard facts .
detailed information is elusive , affected animals often disappear into the bush to die , and the evidence is then eaten by other carnivores .

in a statement , the sabah progressive party -lrb- sapp -rrb- said it had lost faith in the leadership of abdullah badawi .
it is one of the smaller parties in the 14-strong coalition , but the move could gather momentum if other parties join the revolt .
the move comes as a fresh blow to mr abdullah , who is already under mounting pressure to resign .
people are angry about sharp fuel price rises , while the ruling coalition is still reeling from heavy losses in march 's general election .
the coalition lost its two-thirds majority in parliament for the first time since independence in 1957 .
oil revenues sapp , from malaysian borneo , has two seats in parliament .
its leaders accused the government of ignoring the region 's needs , and said the no-confidence motion would be put to parliament on monday .
" people have lost confidence in the present leadership of abdullah ahmad badawi , " sapp 's vice-president chua soon bui said in a statement .
the move would be unprecedented in malaysia , reports the bbc 's south east asia correspondent jonathan head , but it is not clear whether it could gain sufficient support to overthrow the government .
the opposition holds 82 seats in parliament and needs another 30 lawmakers to win a simple majority in the 222-seat chamber .
around a third of the ruling coalition 's lawmakers are from borneo , where there is long-standing resentment over the small share they get of their region 's oil revenues .
de facto opposition leader anwar ibrahim is convinced he will have enough support to overthrow the government before the end of the year .
even if he does not , mr abdullah may still be forced to step down sooner than he plans by his own party , our correspondent adds .

the world health organisation survey of europe and north america put wales at the top of the list , ahead of scotland , estonia , england and lithuania .
the health behaviour study questioned 250,000 11 , 12 and 15-year-olds .
children 's commissioner for wales keith towler said the survey was a wake-up call for adults .
the survey , conducted in 2005-6 across 40 countries , looked at aspects of health , including drinking , weight , smoking , school pressures and bullying .
it found more 15-year-old girls in wales had tried cannabis than anywhere else in europe .
among girls , one in five 11-year-olds in wales are trying to lose weight , as are a quarter of 13-year-olds and nearly a third aged 15 .
more than a third of 15-year-old girls and a quarter of 15-year-old boys in wales say they tried smoking at 13 or younger , figures which are similar to scotland but higher than england .
the survey found children in england and wales were under more pressure than almost every other country which took part .
researchers said children in the uk rated their own health " poorly " compared to other countries , and found it harder to talk to their parents .
a spokesperson for the chief medical officer for wales , tony jewell , said : " reports with a global outlook , such as this , play a vital role in highlighting key health matters that occur here in wales and support the minister and officials to tailor effective policy to tackle such issues .
" reducing the underage consumption of alcohol is a key priority in wales .
" the increasing culture of binge drinking in wales ' youngsters leads to greater risk of injury , unsafe sex , and serious health issues in later life that will inevitably put greater pressure on the nhs . "
as adults we have got to think of our responsibilities to children and what example we are setting " keith towler , children 's commissioner for wales " the welsh assembly government launched a 10-year substance misuse strategy in february .
by 2010-11 , £ 27m a year will be funded to the strategy which will place a significant focus on the inappropriate and risky use of alcohol , instances of which are higher in wales than most other countries , although less so than in recent years . "
but mr towler said the emphasis now had to be on putting the policies into practice .
" i was at the united nations committee last week on the rights of the child and we talked about how good some of the policies and strategies are that we have in place particularly in wales and through the welsh assembly government , " he said .
" but we really still are not seeing implementation of these strategies on the ground . "
mr towler also said the survey also highlighted problems with the availability of services for children and young people in wales .
he was also critical about the way alcohol was marketed and he called on adults to set a better example .
" the whole of our culture is based on drinking , " he said .
" as adults we have got to think of our responsibilities to children and what example we are setting . "
kathryn allen from promo cymru , which is a social enterprise and youth development organisation , said that having a drink was often cheaper for young people and children than going to the cinema in the evening .
" there are pubs on every corner , there are shops everywhere selling cheap alcohol and we have the issues with binge drinking .
this is a society issue , " she said .

health secretary alan johnson told the guardian newspaper that he wants the performance of every nursing team in england to be scored .
he said he believes compassionate care was as crucial to the recovery of patients as the skills of surgeons .
nurse leaders welcomed the move and said they would work with ministers on developing the system .
mr johnson said plans were to be outlined in the forthcoming review of the nhs by health minister lord darzi . "
nurses work tirelessly to ensure that patients are treated with dignity , compassion and sensitivity " peter carter , of the royal college of nursing wales , northern ireland and scotland are not planning to introduce a similar scheme , although nurse performance is already monitored through patient surveys and core standards .
mr johnson suggested the results , compiled by regulators using patient surveys , could be displayed on an official website .
but he ruled out rating individual nurses and also said it would not affect pay .
standards of nutritional care , minimisation of pain , hand-washing , and safety on the wards could also be measured , he added .
mr johnson said he hoped to encourage friendly rivalry between wards over which nursing team could achieve the best ratings .
the scheme will be piloted and the first results are likely to emerge next year .
compassion mr johnson said : " what nurses tell us is that you can have the best surgeon in the world , who carries out the most terrific operation on you , but your stay in hospital wo n't be satisfactory if you do n't get a high level of compassion and care .
" if your experience involves nurses looking grumpy , or someone being rude , or not getting people there when you need them , then it ruins the whole experience . "
peter carter , general secretary of the royal college of nursing , said the union would work with government on the scheme .
" these new standards are groundbreaking in that they will directly recognise nurses for the kind of care that patients really value .
" nurses work tirelessly to ensure that patients are treated with dignity , compassion and sensitivity , aspects of care which are so important but rarely measured . "
but steve barnett , acting chief executive of the nhs confederation , which represents health managers , warned : " it will be very difficult to measure and benchmark compassion - particularly at the level of the ward . "
meanwhile , 12 leading health unions representing nurses , midwives , paramedics and a range on non-medical health staff have agreed to sign off the government 's three-year pay deal worth 8 % .
but the unions have warned if inflation continues to rise they will activate a clause compelling the governments of the uk to enter talks to renegotiate the deal .
it comes after the majority of the unions had already indicated they would agree to the deal after balloting members .

health secretary alan johnson told the guardian newspaper that he wants the performance of every nursing team in england to be scored .
he said he believes compassionate care was as crucial to the recovery of patients as the skills of surgeons .
nurse leaders welcomed the move and said they would work with ministers on developing the system .
mr johnson said plans were to be outlined in the forthcoming review of the nhs by health minister lord darzi .
nurses work tirelessly to ensure that patients are treated with dignity , compassion and sensitivity peter carter , of the royal college of nursing wales , northern ireland and scotland are not planning to introduce a similar scheme , although nurse performance is already monitored through patient surveys and core standards .
mr johnson suggested the results , compiled by regulators using patient surveys , could be displayed on an official website .
but he ruled out rating individual nurses and also said it would not affect pay .
standards of nutritional care , minimisation of pain , hand-washing , and safety on the wards could also be measured , he added .
mr johnson said he hoped to encourage friendly rivalry between wards over which nursing team could achieve the best ratings .
the scheme will be piloted and the first results are likely to emerge next year .
compassion mr johnson said : " what nurses tell us is that you can have the best surgeon in the world , who carries out the most terrific operation on you , but your stay in hospital wo n't be satisfactory if you do n't get a high level of compassion and care .
" if your experience involves nurses looking grumpy , or someone being rude , or not getting people there when you need them , then it ruins the whole experience . "
peter carter , general secretary of the royal college of nursing , said the union would work with government on the scheme .
" these new standards are groundbreaking in that they will directly recognise nurses for the kind of care that patients really value .
" nurses work tirelessly to ensure that patients are treated with dignity , compassion and sensitivity , aspects of care which are so important but rarely measured . "
but steve barnett , acting chief executive of the nhs confederation , which represents health managers , warned : " it will be very difficult to measure and benchmark compassion - particularly at the level of the ward . "
meanwhile , 12 leading health unions representing nurses , midwives , paramedics and a range on non-medical health staff have agreed to sign off the government 's three-year pay deal worth 8 % .
but the unions have warned if inflation continues to rise they will activate a clause compelling the governments of the uk to enter talks to renegotiate the deal .
it comes after the majority of the unions had already indicated they would agree to the deal after balloting members .

breakfast really could be the most important meal of the day when it comes to losing weight , claims a researcher .
over several months , obese women who ate half their daily calories first thing fared better than those eating a much smaller amount .
us researcher dr daniela jakubowicz told a san francisco conference having a small breakfast could actually boost food cravings .
a uk expert said a big breakfast diet might simply be less boring .
it could be that it is simply easier for people on a higher-carbohydrate diet to comply with it over a longer period dr alex johnstone rowett research institute , aberdeen dr jakubowicz , from virginia commonwealth university , has been recommending a hearty breakfast to her patients for 15 years .
she tested it against a low carbohydrate diet in a study of 96 obese and physically inactive women .
this diet involved 1,085 calories a day - the majority of these coming from protein and fat .
breakfast here was the smallest meal of the day - just 290 calories , with just seven grams of carbohydrates .
her " big breakfast " diet involved more calories - 1,240 - with a lower proportion of fat and more carbohydrates and protein .
breakfast here was 610 calories , with 58 grams of carbohydrates , while lunch and dinner were 395 and 235 calories respectively .
four months on , the low-carb dieters appeared to be doing better , losing an average of 28 pounds to the 23 shed on the " big breakfast " diet .
however , after eight months , the situation had reversed , with the low-carb dieters putting an average of 18 of those pounds back on , while the big breakfasters continued to lose weight , on average 16.5 pounds each .
they lost a fifth of their total body weight on average , compared with less than 5 % for the low-carb dieters .
slower metabolism dr jakubowicz reported that the big breakfasters said they felt less hungry , particularly in the mornings .
she said : " most weight loss studies have determined that a very low carbohydrate diet is not a good method to reduce weight .
" it exacerbates the craving for carbohydrates and slows metabolism - as a result , after a short period of weight loss , there is a quick return to obesity . "
she said that the bigger breakfast helped by making people feel fuller during the day , and was healthier , because it allowed more fibre and fruit to be included .
dr alex johnstone , from the rowett research institute in aberdeen , said that other studies had shown that while low-carb diets were a " good tool " to reduce weight quickly , they were not a " diet for life " .
she said that the regaining of lost weight by these dieters could be more a sign of the relative monotony of the two diets , rather than their ability to necessarily reduce cravings .
" it could be that it is simply easier for people on a higher-carbohydrate diet to comply with it over a longer period . "
a spokesman for the british nutrition foundation said there was evidence that a good-sized breakfast could help dieters .
she said : " research shows that eating breakfast can actually help people control their weight .
" this is probably because when we do n't have breakfast we 're more likely to get hungry before lunch and snack on foods that are high in fat and sugar , such as biscuits , doughnuts or pastries . "

breakfast really could be the most important meal of the day when it comes to losing weight , claims a researcher .
over several months , obese women who ate half their daily calories first thing fared better than those eating a much smaller amount .
us researcher dr daniela jakubowicz told a san francisco conference having a small breakfast could actually boost food cravings .
a uk expert said a big breakfast diet might simply be less boring .
it could be that it is simply easier for people on a higher-carbohydrate diet to comply with it over a longer period dr alex johnstone rowett research institute , aberdeen dr jakubowicz , from virginia commonwealth university , has been recommending a hearty breakfast to her patients for 15 years .
she tested it against a low carbohydrate diet in a study of 96 obese and physically inactive women .
this diet involved 1,085 calories a day - the majority of these coming from protein and fat .
breakfast here was the smallest meal of the day - just 290 calories , with just seven grams of carbohydrates .
her " big breakfast " diet involved more calories - 1,240 - with a lower proportion of fat and more carbohydrates and protein .
breakfast here was 610 calories , with 58 grams of carbohydrates , while lunch and dinner were 395 and 235 calories respectively .
four months on , the low-carb dieters appeared to be doing better , losing an average of 28 pounds to the 23 shed on the " big breakfast " diet .
however , after eight months , the situation had reversed , with the low-carb dieters putting an average of 18 of those pounds back on , while the big breakfasters continued to lose weight , on average 16.5 pounds each .
they lost a fifth of their total body weight on average , compared with less than 5 % for the low-carb dieters .
slower metabolism dr jakubowicz reported that the big breakfasters said they felt less hungry , particularly in the mornings .
she said : " most weight loss studies have determined that a very low carbohydrate diet is not a good method to reduce weight .
" it exacerbates the craving for carbohydrates and slows metabolism - as a result , after a short period of weight loss , there is a quick return to obesity . "
she said that the bigger breakfast helped by making people feel fuller during the day , and was healthier , because it allowed more fibre and fruit to be included .
dr alex johnstone , from the rowett research institute in aberdeen , said that other studies had shown that while low-carb diets were a " good tool " to reduce weight quickly , they were not a " diet for life " .
she said that the regaining of lost weight by these dieters could be more a sign of the relative monotony of the two diets , rather than their ability to necessarily reduce cravings .
" it could be that it is simply easier for people on a higher-carbohydrate diet to comply with it over a longer period . "
a spokesman for the british nutrition foundation said there was evidence that a good-sized breakfast could help dieters .
she said : " research shows that eating breakfast can actually help people control their weight .
" this is probably because when we do n't have breakfast we 're more likely to get hungry before lunch and snack on foods that are high in fat and sugar , such as biscuits , doughnuts or pastries . "

james houston 's four-minute film , big ideas -lrb- do n't get any -rrb- , is a video and track remix of the band 's single nude from their album in rainbows .
but unusually it blends sounds from a dot matrix printer , zx spectrum , old hard drives and a scanner .
the 21-year-old from north lanarkshire is now picking over job offers .
james made the clip at a small studio in glasgow by carefully programming each piece of equipment .
once completed , he uploaded it to video-sharing sites you tube and vimeo .
david smith , a close friend of radiohead and a lecturer in media and technology in london , thought the film was fantastic and informed the band .
bassist colin greenwood agreed and posted a link to the film on the radiohead website .
' amazing projects ' this level of exposure catapulted the film to number three in the music videos of the week -lrb- globally -rrb- chart on you tube as well as the number three top favourite video .
james , who lives in airdrie , has since been interviewed on us radio and invited to show his film in amsterdam , as well as at a host of uk music festivals .
" i 've been completely overwhelmed by the huge response to the film , " he said .
" this was a small video for the gsa which was edited in my bedroom with my dog at my feet and now it 's grown out of control .
the video has attracted huge interest on youtube and vimeo " i 've had over 3,000 really lovely emails from people all around the world , been offered a record deal although i 'm not a musician and been asked to get involved in lots of other amazing projects . "
paul stickley , head of visual communication at gsa , said : " james ' film plays with musical conventions and structure and opens up a set of discussions regarding the nature of visual communication , graphic design and music .
" his film focuses on cultural identity and way we adopt an emotional relationship with obsolete technologies .
" for example the sinclair zx spectrum has attracted an audience that has a nostalgic affection for this hardware .
" the film , with its subtlety of composition and sophistication of colour , synchronisation of audio and musicianship , deserves the recognition that it has attracted across the world . "

politkovskaya , a prominent kremlin critic , was shot dead outside her home in the capital on 7 october 2006 .
russia 's investigative committee said a fourth man , an officer with the country 's security service , had also been charged with abuse of office .
last month officials also named the man suspected of firing the gun as rustam makhmudov .
he remains at large .
the three men charged over the murder , who all come from chechnya , are sergey khadzhikurbanov , and dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov .
case continues the committee did not say what the motive was for politkovskaya 's killing , or specify the suspects ' roles in the murder .
politkovskaya frequently travelled to chechnya and the north caucasus where her dispatches described some of the horror of a war where most of the casualties were civilians .
the murder of politkovskaya , who wrote for the small-circulation novaya gazeta , shocked the international community but did not register widely in russia .
human rights groups accused the russian authorities of failing to protect journalists .
her former colleagues said the case was not yet solved .
" i have said many times that this is only the first part of the case , " said sergei sokolov , the investigative newspaper 's deputy editor .
" it 's not over yet , there will be a second and a third part . "
charges against a fifth man , a chechen local government official who allegedly provided the address of anna politkovskaya , have been dropped due to a lack of evidence .

who , what , why ?
the magazine answers ...
one of the uk 's top terrorism suspects is starting a new life beyond the razor wire of prison - within the walls of his own home .
is this house arrest ?
the government views jordanian cleric abu qatada as a dangerous man who once played a key role in linking extremist cells throughout europe .
but he has been released from jail after the court of appeal ruled that he could not be deported to his home country .
while the case waits for its day before the house of lords , abu qatada will be ordered to stay at home for 22 hours a day , along with restrictions including who he can meet and how he communicates with the outside world .
the answer control orders - including home curfews - introduced post-9/11 restrict movements of terror suspects who ca n't be kept in jail or deported but does this amount to house arrest ?
and if so , what does it actually mean in english law ?
in most people 's minds , the phrase " house arrest " prompts thoughts of dictatorships .
over the past year its appearance in parliament has almost exclusively come in debates referring to burma 's long-suffering opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
the most famous case in the uk was the 17 months spent by general pinochet in the leafy surrounds of a luxury surrey home as he battled against extradition to spain .
but forms of home detention have increasingly become a key tool because of three inter-locking factors : immigration powers counter-terrrorism strategy tagging technology in the immigration system , home detention is key to dealing with some of those the government wants to deport - and this is why abu qatada is being subjected to 22 hours of curfew .
judges can order a highly restrictive curfew if the authorities want to deport someone from the uk , and they also have a realistic prospect of doing so .
the complicating factor has been how these powers mix with counter-terrorism operations .
in the wake of 9/11 , the government detained people in prison whom it accused of posing a threat to national security .
parliament brought in these unusual powers to deal with suspects ministers said they could neither deport nor prosecute .
but the law lords threw out that piece of legislation , forcing ministers to think again .
some of the detainees , who were released from jail immediately , went onto a 24-hour home curfew , very quickly replaced by the control order powers .
these powers are a civil measure rather than criminal punishment , designed to restrict the freedoms of a suspect to prevent them from doing something .
control orders include long curfews in the home , regular contact with the police , restrictions on work or study , use of the phone , internet and whom someone could meet .
they 're designed to restrict the movements of those where the authorities say they ca n't be kept in jail .
in the case of abu qatada , he was one of those released and put on a control order .
the government struck a deal with jordan saying it had a good chance to remove him from the uk , so he later went back into prison .
but they have objected to curfews longer than 16 hours because the suspect could be stuck indefinitely in that position - unlike immigration or extradition curfews , which are a stage on the way to deportation .
restricted movements so are control orders house arrest ?
judges have thrown out every attempt to have control orders ruled as illegal ; they accept the need for some kind of house arrest .
who , what , why ?
a regular part of the bbc news magazine , who , what , why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines the issue is whether control orders and severely restrictive immigration curfews , like that now used against abu qatada , breach without good reason rights to a fair trial and liberty .
one judge , mr justice sullivan , has described control orders as " the antithesis of liberty and more akin to detention in an open prison " .
" they fall not very far short of house arrest , and certainly inhibit normal life considerably , " he says .
other judges have been more relaxed where officials have allowed the suspect a little latitude in their daily lives .
the european court of human rights , which includes uk judges , has gone further , ruling against a 24-hour curfew imposed on a mafia don who was confined to a small island for 16 months .
but none of this means house arrest-like conditions are illegal - it 's just that officials must prove to judges that there is a good reason to use such extreme measures .
but here is the problem with the abu qatada case .
if the law lords rule that he can not be deported , the government may not be able to request a 22-hour curfew anymore .
they will need to prosecute him or place him under a control order again .
the entire saga comes full circle .
stay or go so do we have house arrest or not in the uk ?
on the government side , it 's not a term you will hear officials bandy around regularly - it has a slightly too emotional whiff about it for whitehall legalese .
but the reality is that they accept that it 's widely used and is useful in demonstrating a tough position on difficult cases .
in the case of abu qatada and other suspects , the home secretary says that case is clearly made because how could such a dangerous man be allowed to walk the streets .
it 's not ideal , but it 's the best of a bad situation , argue officials .
but stephanie harrison , a barrister involved in both control orders and tricky cases at the special immigration appeals commission , says that you ca n't call the conditions anything but house arrest .
" the regime is in place for a very long period of time - the experience is very destructive because every aspect of your life is controlled , " she says of control orders .
" it 's a radical deviation from due process because the subject is neither a prisoner nor free person . "

who , what , why ?
the magazine answers ...
abu qatada , osama bin laden 's " right-hand man in europe " one of the uk 's top terrorism suspects is starting a new life beyond the razor wire of prison - within the walls of his own home .
is this house arrest ?
the government views jordanian cleric abu qatada as a dangerous man who once played a key role in linking extremist cells throughout europe .
but he has been released from jail after the court of appeal ruled that he could not be deported to his home country .
while the case waits for its day before the house of lords , abu qatada will be ordered to stay at home for 22 hours a day , along with restrictions including who he can meet and how he communicates with the outside world .
the answer control orders - including home curfews - introduced post-9/11 restrict movements of terror suspects who ca n't be kept in jail or deported but does this amount to house arrest ?
and if so , what does it actually mean in english law ?
in most people 's minds , the phrase " house arrest " prompts thoughts of dictatorships .
over the past year its appearance in parliament has almost exclusively come in debates referring to burma 's long-suffering opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
the most famous case in the uk was the 17 months spent by general pinochet in the leafy surrounds of a luxury surrey home as he battled against extradition to spain .
but forms of home detention have increasingly become a key tool because of three inter-locking factors : immigration powers counter-terrrorism strategy tagging technology in the immigration system , home detention is key to dealing with some of those the government wants to deport - and this is why abu qatada is being subjected to 22 hours of curfew .
judges can order a highly restrictive curfew if the authorities want to deport someone from the uk , and they also have a realistic prospect of doing so .
the complicating factor has been how these powers mix with counter-terrorism operations .
aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for six years in the wake of 9/11 , the government detained people in prison whom it accused of posing a threat to national security .
parliament brought in these unusual powers to deal with suspects ministers said they could neither deport nor prosecute .
but the law lords threw out that piece of legislation , forcing ministers to think again .
some of the detainees , who were released from jail immediately , went onto a 24-hour home curfew , very quickly replaced by the control order powers .
these powers are a civil measure rather than criminal punishment , designed to restrict the freedoms of a suspect to prevent them from doing something .
control orders include long curfews in the home , regular contact with the police , restrictions on work or study , use of the phone , internet and whom someone could meet .
they 're designed to restrict the movements of those where the authorities say they ca n't be kept in jail .
in the case of abu qatada , he was one of those released and put on a control order .
the government struck a deal with jordan saying it had a good chance to remove him from the uk , so he later went back into prison .
but they have objected to curfews longer than 16 hours because the suspect could be stuck indefinitely in that position - unlike immigration or extradition curfews , which are a stage on the way to deportation .
restricted movements so are control orders house arrest ?
judges have thrown out every attempt to have control orders ruled as illegal ; they accept the need for some kind of house arrest .
who , what , why ?
a regular part of the bbc news magazine , who , what , why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines the issue is whether control orders and severely restrictive immigration curfews , like that now used against abu qatada , breach without good reason rights to a fair trial and liberty .
one judge , mr justice sullivan , has described control orders as " the antithesis of liberty and more akin to detention in an open prison " .
" they fall not very far short of house arrest , and certainly inhibit normal life considerably , " he says .
other judges have been more relaxed where officials have allowed the suspect a little latitude in their daily lives .
the european court of human rights , which includes uk judges , has gone further , ruling against a 24-hour curfew imposed on a mafia don who was confined to a small island for 16 months .
but none of this means house arrest-like conditions are illegal - it 's just that officials must prove to judges that there is a good reason to use such extreme measures .
but here is the problem with the abu qatada case .
if the law lords rule that he can not be deported , the government may not be able to request a 22-hour curfew anymore .
they will need to prosecute him or place him under a control order again .
the entire saga comes full circle .
stay or go so do we have house arrest or not in the uk ?
general pinochet spent 17 months under house arrest in surrey on the government side , it 's not a term you will hear officials bandy around regularly - it has a slightly too emotional whiff about it for whitehall legalese .
but the reality is that they accept that it 's widely used and is useful in demonstrating a tough position on difficult cases .
in the case of abu qatada and other suspects , the home secretary says that case is clearly made because how could such a dangerous man be allowed to walk the streets .
it 's not ideal , but it 's the best of a bad situation , argue officials .
but stephanie harrison , a barrister involved in both control orders and tricky cases at the special immigration appeals commission , says that you ca n't call the conditions anything but house arrest .
" the regime is in place for a very long period of time - the experience is very destructive because every aspect of your life is controlled , " she says of control orders .
" it 's a radical deviation from due process because the subject is neither a prisoner nor free person . "
