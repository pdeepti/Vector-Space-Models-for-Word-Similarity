the us says it will hit back . the european biodiesel board -lrb- ebb -rrb- said the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , b99 , which can receive a subsidy of $ 300 -lrb- 192 euros -rrb- per ton . on top of the us aid , exports of the b99 blend are also eligible for a subsidy in europe as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists in europe say the us is squeezing european producers ' profit margins the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , " putting most of them out of business " and leaving capacity idle . " in view of the critical circumstances prevailing on the eu biodiesel market , the eu biodiesel industry is urging the european commission to initiate an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation , with a view to impose as soon as possible countervailing measures against us ' b99 ' exports , " it said . the commission must examine the request before it can decide on opening an investigation , which would be necessary before any wto action could be pursued . americans see hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says it will hit back against any trade barrier that hurts its producers the head of the national biodiesel board , a us biodiesel group , said , however , that the eu is embarking down a protectionist path and that his organization would " aggressively challenge " any kind of trade obstacle put in place by the eu . " it 's hypocritical for the european biodiesel board to cry foul while they benefit from a blatant trade barrier , " manning feraci , vice-president of federal affairs at the national biodiesel board , said in a statement . he said eu biodiesel fuel specifications were discriminatory and did not conform to world trade organization rules .
he said european rules gave preferential treatment to european producers . biofuel controversy biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to gasoline-based diesel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are asking if biofuels are more trouble than they 're worth ?
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops . as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets .
-lrb- 14.04.2008 -rrb- german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .

now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem . a common " organ pool " and a single transplantation hotline are also among the proposed measures passed by the european parliament last week .
the european parliament also urged effective measures to be introduced to stop the trade in organs , calling for the 27-states to ensure that organ donations were made " without any self-interest and voluntarily " and no payments were made to the donors .
it was agreed the commercial use of organs was not defensible and represented an " violation of human dignity . "
citizens of poorer countries need protected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are squeamish about the idea of signing away their organs european parliamentarian peter liese -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the illegal organ trade would undermine the credibility of the planned donor system and also stressed the importance of stopping " transplantation tourism . "
" in developing countries and also in poor eu countries like romania and bulgaria , patients are often encouraged to put their health at risk , " said liese . some 40,000 patients are currently awaiting transplants in western europe alone , according to a parliamentary report .

germany has a middle ranking of some 16 organs per million citizens .
part of the reason for this are the differing legal requirements .
in germany and the netherlands , for example , there is an opt-in system , whereas in spain and belgium you have to opt out .
the european commission believe the introduction of a european donor card - combined with an awareness-raising campaign - could help boost the number of people willing to donate their organs .
it could close the gap between what people say and what they do .
according to an eu survey , some 80 percent are in favor of donor cards , but only 12 percent actually own one . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .
two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources .
it later apologized , calling it a one-off .
shocking revelation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrang 's communication with a german journalist was monitored by the bnd in an article written before the steinmeier-spanta phone call and released on saturday ahead of publication , der spiegel reported that spanta had in fact been outraged by the revelation .
" i am angry and repulsed by these methods that should not take place in a democracy , " spanta told the weekly .
he expressed shock that germany , which he saw as a close ally , would take action of this kind .
the german foreign ministry said steinmeier was still seeking to contact farhang , who studied in germany and speaks fluent german , to express his regrets personally .
disciplinary measures on thursday , chancellor angela merkel 's office ordered disciplinary measures be taken against three intelligence service members , including uhrlau and the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd president ernst uhrlau has been the target of intense criticism uhrlau was brought before the parliamentary control commission on wednesday and thursday and told of the bundestag 's displeasure . he has faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal , but the parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- stopped short of demanding he step down . farhang was angered by the revelation that he had been spied on , telling the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung that the implication that he was in complicity with the taliban had endangered him and his family .
another german daily , the mitteldeutsche zeitung , reported on saturday that other afghan ministers feared they had been monitored as well by the bnd , which had allegedly also eavesdropped on farhang 's phone calls .
six of the 20 afghan cabinet ministers have spent part of their lives in germany and speak german , the newspaper said .

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem . a common " organ pool " and a single transplantation hotline are also among the proposed measures passed by the european parliament last week .
the european parliament also urged effective measures to be introduced to stop the trade in organs , calling for the 27-states to ensure that organ donations were made " without any self-interest and voluntarily " and no payments were made to the donors .
it was agreed the commercial use of organs was not defensible and represented an " violation of human dignity . "
citizens of poorer countries need protected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are squeamish about the idea of signing away their organs european parliamentarian peter liese -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the illegal organ trade would undermine the credibility of the planned donor system and also stressed the importance of stopping " transplantation tourism . "
" in developing countries and also in poor eu countries like romania and bulgaria , patients are often encouraged to put their health at risk , " said liese . some 40,000 patients are currently awaiting transplants in western europe alone , according to a parliamentary report .
the death rate for those waiting for a heart , lung or kidney transplant lies somewhere between 15 and 30 percent .
a mixed picture across the continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national donor cards like this one would be replaced by a europe-wide scheme donation rates vary widely across europe .
in spain , about 35 people out of a million donate their organs , while in eastern european countries the rate is a mere 0.8 .
germany has a middle ranking of some 16 organs per million citizens .
part of the reason for this are the differing legal requirements .
in germany and the netherlands , for example , there is an opt-in system , whereas in spain and belgium you have to opt out .
the european commission believe the introduction of a european donor card - combined with an awareness-raising campaign - could help boost the number of people willing to donate their organs .
it could close the gap between what people say and what they do .
according to an eu survey , some 80 percent are in favor of donor cards , but only 12 percent actually own one . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says it will hit back . the european biodiesel board -lrb- ebb -rrb- said the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , b99 , which can receive a subsidy of $ 300 -lrb- 192 euros -rrb- per ton . on top of the us aid , exports of the b99 blend are also eligible for a subsidy in europe as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists in europe say the us is squeezing european producers ' profit margins the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , " putting most of them out of business " and leaving capacity idle . " in view of the critical circumstances prevailing on the eu biodiesel market , the eu biodiesel industry is urging the european commission to initiate an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation , with a view to impose as soon as possible countervailing measures against us ' b99 ' exports , " it said . the commission must examine the request before it can decide on opening an investigation , which would be necessary before any wto action could be pursued . americans see hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says it will hit back against any trade barrier that hurts its producers the head of the national biodiesel board , a us biodiesel group , said , however , that the eu is embarking down a protectionist path and that his organization would " aggressively challenge " any kind of trade obstacle put in place by the eu . " it 's hypocritical for the european biodiesel board to cry foul while they benefit from a blatant trade barrier , " manning feraci , vice-president of federal affairs at the national biodiesel board , said in a statement . he said eu biodiesel fuel specifications were discriminatory and did not conform to world trade organization rules .

" a winner at the cannes film festival last year , the movie - called " auf der andern seite " in german - went on to win four more awards at the german film academy 's ceremony in berlin on friday , april 25 : gold for best film , best director , best script - all for akin - and a best editing prize for andrew bird .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin has been critical of the german film academy in the past " danke , danke , danke , " said a grateful akin , a hamburg-based director of turkish descent whose hard-hitting films about the struggles and confusion of turkish immigrants in germany have won also honors at the berlin and cannes film festivals .
" it 's extraordinarily difficult to measure art in any way , " said akin , 34 , whose 2003 film " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- also drew international accolades .
" so i 'm delighted , " he said at a gala with more than 1,500 spectators broadcast live on television .
" we do n't make films for prizes but rather for life . "
the young director has often criticized the german film academy in the past for the way it selects its lola nominees .
silver lola for doris doerrie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cherry blossoms " was considered a favorite for the golden lola " kirschblueten " -lrb- cherry blossoms -rrb- - a moving love story about a cranky bavarian civil servant who travels to japan after to fulfill the dream of his dead wife - by director doris doerrie , had led the field with six nominations , but won just two for best actor -lrb- elmar wepper -rrb- and best costume design .
" kirschblueten " also won the silver lola for best picture .
surprise box-office hit " die welle " -lrb- the wave -rrb- by dennis gansel , a drama set in modern germany , in which one charismatic teacher 's experiment turns a high school into a paradigm of a dictatorship , took the bronze lola in the best picture category .
bettina bluemner 's " princesses ' swimming pool " - a portrait of three teenage girls living in berlin 's multicultural kreuzberg district - won the prize for best documentary .
armin voelckers ' movie " leroy " - a movie about an afro-german teen who falls in love with girl from a right-wing extremist family - picked up the children and youth film lola .
german oscars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the wave " won the bronze lola for best film more than 1,000 industry professionals - members of the german film academy - cast the ballots for the 3-million-euro -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- german film prize .
the government underwrites the prizes to be distributed among the nominated films , as a kind of subsidy for future projects .
in 2006 , florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " - a film about an east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the totalitarian system he has worked to uphold - won seven lolas before later winning an oscar for best foreign film .
the lolas , which are seen as germany 's answer to hollywood 's oscars , have been presented since 1951 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 26.04.2008 germany apologizes for spying on afghan minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes that the wiretapping incident will not damage its relations with afghanistan foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called his afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta on saturday to express regret over the monitoring of another afghan minister by the german foreign intelligence service . both sides had expressed the view that the affair - the monitoring of e-mail correspondence between afghan trade and industry minister amin farhang and a german journalist - would not impact on " the good trusting relations " between germany and afghanistan , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said on saturday , april 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .
two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources .
it later apologized , calling it a one-off .
shocking revelation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrang 's communication with a german journalist was monitored by the bnd in an article written before the steinmeier-spanta phone call and released on saturday ahead of publication , der spiegel reported that spanta had in fact been outraged by the revelation .
" i am angry and repulsed by these methods that should not take place in a democracy , " spanta told the weekly .
he expressed shock that germany , which he saw as a close ally , would take action of this kind .
the german foreign ministry said steinmeier was still seeking to contact farhang , who studied in germany and speaks fluent german , to express his regrets personally .
disciplinary measures on thursday , chancellor angela merkel 's office ordered disciplinary measures be taken against three intelligence service members , including uhrlau and the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd president ernst uhrlau has been the target of intense criticism uhrlau was brought before the parliamentary control commission on wednesday and thursday and told of the bundestag 's displeasure . he has faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal , but the parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- stopped short of demanding he step down . farhang was angered by the revelation that he had been spied on , telling the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung that the implication that he was in complicity with the taliban had endangered him and his family .
another german daily , the mitteldeutsche zeitung , reported on saturday that other afghan ministers feared they had been monitored as well by the bnd , which had allegedly also eavesdropped on farhang 's phone calls .
six of the 20 afghan cabinet ministers have spent part of their lives in germany and speak german , the newspaper said .
farhang holds a doctorate from the university of cologne and taught at the university of bochum before returning home . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .
two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources .
it later apologized , calling it a one-off .
shocking revelation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrang 's communication with a german journalist was monitored by the bnd in an article written before the steinmeier-spanta phone call and released on saturday ahead of publication , der spiegel reported that spanta had in fact been outraged by the revelation .
" i am angry and repulsed by these methods that should not take place in a democracy , " spanta told the weekly .
he expressed shock that germany , which he saw as a close ally , would take action of this kind .
the german foreign ministry said steinmeier was still seeking to contact farhang , who studied in germany and speaks fluent german , to express his regrets personally .
disciplinary measures on thursday , chancellor angela merkel 's office ordered disciplinary measures be taken against three intelligence service members , including uhrlau and the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd president ernst uhrlau has been the target of intense criticism uhrlau was brought before the parliamentary control commission on wednesday and thursday and told of the bundestag 's displeasure . he has faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal , but the parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- stopped short of demanding he step down . farhang was angered by the revelation that he had been spied on , telling the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung that the implication that he was in complicity with the taliban had endangered him and his family .
another german daily , the mitteldeutsche zeitung , reported on saturday that other afghan ministers feared they had been monitored as well by the bnd , which had allegedly also eavesdropped on farhang 's phone calls .
six of the 20 afghan cabinet ministers have spent part of their lives in germany and speak german , the newspaper said .

now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem . a common " organ pool " and a single transplantation hotline are also among the proposed measures passed by the european parliament last week .
the european parliament also urged effective measures to be introduced to stop the trade in organs , calling for the 27-states to ensure that organ donations were made " without any self-interest and voluntarily " and no payments were made to the donors .
it was agreed the commercial use of organs was not defensible and represented an " violation of human dignity . "
citizens of poorer countries need protected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are squeamish about the idea of signing away their organs european parliamentarian peter liese -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the illegal organ trade would undermine the credibility of the planned donor system and also stressed the importance of stopping " transplantation tourism . "
" in developing countries and also in poor eu countries like romania and bulgaria , patients are often encouraged to put their health at risk , " said liese . some 40,000 patients are currently awaiting transplants in western europe alone , according to a parliamentary report .
the death rate for those waiting for a heart , lung or kidney transplant lies somewhere between 15 and 30 percent .
a mixed picture across the continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national donor cards like this one would be replaced by a europe-wide scheme donation rates vary widely across europe .
in spain , about 35 people out of a million donate their organs , while in eastern european countries the rate is a mere 0.8 .
germany has a middle ranking of some 16 organs per million citizens .
part of the reason for this are the differing legal requirements .
in germany and the netherlands , for example , there is an opt-in system , whereas in spain and belgium you have to opt out .
the european commission believe the introduction of a european donor card - combined with an awareness-raising campaign - could help boost the number of people willing to donate their organs .
it could close the gap between what people say and what they do .
according to an eu survey , some 80 percent are in favor of donor cards , but only 12 percent actually own one . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .

those who stay at home are labeled " desperados " and often earn so little , regardless of how many degrees they have , that they can hardly survive . agnieszka koscianska just defended her dissertation last month and now works full-time as a lecturer at the university of warsaw 's sociology institute .
she gives three seminars and one lecture every week - for a monthly salary of around 300 euros -lrb- $ 475 -rrb- . the 32-year-old is frustrated . " first you study hard and do a doctorate ; you can speak several languages and work a lot .
but in the end you earn about the same as a cleaning lady - with all due respect for their work , " she said . agnieszka has made a name for herself with her research in the field of gender studies .
she has a long list of publications and is regularly invited to give radio and television interviews .
research trips in copenhagen and new york , made possible by scholarships , fill out her resume . if everyone left … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university in warsaw many of her fellow students have taken positions abroad , mainly due to the low pay in poland , but that 's not an option for agnieszka . " i 've often thought about a career abroad , but i decided to stay here for private and especially for ideological reasons , " she said .
" not everyone can go - then there would n't be any more lecturers at the university . " agnieszka has a few advantages : she shares living expenses with her boyfriend michal , who translates ukrainian literature for a living .
and her parents bought her an apartment when she started studying , so she does n't have to pay rent .
in warsaw , the cost of an apartment would exceed her monthly income . even so , she 'll have to get by until she completes her postdoctoral lecture qualification , since her financial situation is n't likely to change any time soon .
compared to other eu countries , poland does n't spend a lot on education - only 0.4 percent of its gross domestic product - despite criticism from politicians and academics .
that puts a low ceiling on salaries for lecturers and professors . financial aid for home-comers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time abroad is essential to an academic career the foundation for polish science wants to help ease the situation .
it has initiated some 20 programs aimed at supporting talented students , one of which - called " powroty / homing " - is especially aimed at young academics who return to poland . the foundation 's vice president , tomasz perkowski , called the program a kind of financial " airbag " to help returning poles deal with the shock of going from well-financed elite universities abroad to poland 's sluggish academic sector . " time abroad is very important for an academic career and we do n't want to create any barriers , " he said .
" but we also want the academics to have a reason to come back . " thirty polish students have benefited from the scholarship so far .
but for agnieszka that 's just a drop in the bucket . " only a few people get a scholarship like that , " she said .

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .

" a winner at the cannes film festival last year , the movie - called " auf der andern seite " in german - went on to win four more awards at the german film academy 's ceremony in berlin on friday , april 25 : gold for best film , best director , best script - all for akin - and a best editing prize for andrew bird .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin has been critical of the german film academy in the past " danke , danke , danke , " said a grateful akin , a hamburg-based director of turkish descent whose hard-hitting films about the struggles and confusion of turkish immigrants in germany have won also honors at the berlin and cannes film festivals .
" it 's extraordinarily difficult to measure art in any way , " said akin , 34 , whose 2003 film " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- also drew international accolades .
" so i 'm delighted , " he said at a gala with more than 1,500 spectators broadcast live on television .
" we do n't make films for prizes but rather for life . "
the young director has often criticized the german film academy in the past for the way it selects its lola nominees .
silver lola for doris doerrie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cherry blossoms " was considered a favorite for the golden lola " kirschblueten " -lrb- cherry blossoms -rrb- - a moving love story about a cranky bavarian civil servant who travels to japan after to fulfill the dream of his dead wife - by director doris doerrie , had led the field with six nominations , but won just two for best actor -lrb- elmar wepper -rrb- and best costume design .
" kirschblueten " also won the silver lola for best picture .
surprise box-office hit " die welle " -lrb- the wave -rrb- by dennis gansel , a drama set in modern germany , in which one charismatic teacher 's experiment turns a high school into a paradigm of a dictatorship , took the bronze lola in the best picture category .
bettina bluemner 's " princesses ' swimming pool " - a portrait of three teenage girls living in berlin 's multicultural kreuzberg district - won the prize for best documentary .
armin voelckers ' movie " leroy " - a movie about an afro-german teen who falls in love with girl from a right-wing extremist family - picked up the children and youth film lola .
german oscars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the wave " won the bronze lola for best film more than 1,000 industry professionals - members of the german film academy - cast the ballots for the 3-million-euro -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- german film prize .
the government underwrites the prizes to be distributed among the nominated films , as a kind of subsidy for future projects .
in 2006 , florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " - a film about an east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the totalitarian system he has worked to uphold - won seven lolas before later winning an oscar for best foreign film .
the lolas , which are seen as germany 's answer to hollywood 's oscars , have been presented since 1951 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .
two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources .
it later apologized , calling it a one-off .

" i am angry and repulsed by these methods that should not take place in a democracy , " spanta told the weekly .
he expressed shock that germany , which he saw as a close ally , would take action of this kind .
the german foreign ministry said steinmeier was still seeking to contact farhang , who studied in germany and speaks fluent german , to express his regrets personally .
disciplinary measures on thursday , chancellor angela merkel 's office ordered disciplinary measures be taken against three intelligence service members , including uhrlau and the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd president ernst uhrlau has been the target of intense criticism uhrlau was brought before the parliamentary control commission on wednesday and thursday and told of the bundestag 's displeasure . he has faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal , but the parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- stopped short of demanding he step down . farhang was angered by the revelation that he had been spied on , telling the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung that the implication that he was in complicity with the taliban had endangered him and his family .
another german daily , the mitteldeutsche zeitung , reported on saturday that other afghan ministers feared they had been monitored as well by the bnd , which had allegedly also eavesdropped on farhang 's phone calls .
six of the 20 afghan cabinet ministers have spent part of their lives in germany and speak german , the newspaper said .

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem . a common " organ pool " and a single transplantation hotline are also among the proposed measures passed by the european parliament last week .
the european parliament also urged effective measures to be introduced to stop the trade in organs , calling for the 27-states to ensure that organ donations were made " without any self-interest and voluntarily " and no payments were made to the donors .
it was agreed the commercial use of organs was not defensible and represented an " violation of human dignity . "

"
" in developing countries and also in poor eu countries like romania and bulgaria , patients are often encouraged to put their health at risk , " said liese . some 40,000 patients are currently awaiting transplants in western europe alone , according to a parliamentary report .
the death rate for those waiting for a heart , lung or kidney transplant lies somewhere between 15 and 30 percent .
a mixed picture across the continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national donor cards like this one would be replaced by a europe-wide scheme donation rates vary widely across europe .
in spain , about 35 people out of a million donate their organs , while in eastern european countries the rate is a mere 0.8 .
germany has a middle ranking of some 16 organs per million citizens .
part of the reason for this are the differing legal requirements .
in germany and the netherlands , for example , there is an opt-in system , whereas in spain and belgium you have to opt out .
the european commission believe the introduction of a european donor card - combined with an awareness-raising campaign - could help boost the number of people willing to donate their organs .
it could close the gap between what people say and what they do .
according to an eu survey , some 80 percent are in favor of donor cards , but only 12 percent actually own one . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .

everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those who stay at home are labeled " desperados " and often earn so little , regardless of how many degrees they have , that they can hardly survive . agnieszka koscianska just defended her dissertation last month and now works full-time as a lecturer at the university of warsaw 's sociology institute .
she gives three seminars and one lecture every week - for a monthly salary of around 300 euros -lrb- $ 475 -rrb- . the 32-year-old is frustrated . " first you study hard and do a doctorate ; you can speak several languages and work a lot .
but in the end you earn about the same as a cleaning lady - with all due respect for their work , " she said . agnieszka has made a name for herself with her research in the field of gender studies .
she has a long list of publications and is regularly invited to give radio and television interviews .
research trips in copenhagen and new york , made possible by scholarships , fill out her resume . if everyone left … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university in warsaw many of her fellow students have taken positions abroad , mainly due to the low pay in poland , but that 's not an option for agnieszka . " i 've often thought about a career abroad , but i decided to stay here for private and especially for ideological reasons , " she said .
" not everyone can go - then there would n't be any more lecturers at the university . " agnieszka has a few advantages : she shares living expenses with her boyfriend michal , who translates ukrainian literature for a living .
and her parents bought her an apartment when she started studying , so she does n't have to pay rent .
in warsaw , the cost of an apartment would exceed her monthly income . even so , she 'll have to get by until she completes her postdoctoral lecture qualification , since her financial situation is n't likely to change any time soon .
compared to other eu countries , poland does n't spend a lot on education - only 0.4 percent of its gross domestic product - despite criticism from politicians and academics .
that puts a low ceiling on salaries for lecturers and professors . financial aid for home-comers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time abroad is essential to an academic career the foundation for polish science wants to help ease the situation .
it has initiated some 20 programs aimed at supporting talented students , one of which - called " powroty / homing " - is especially aimed at young academics who return to poland . the foundation 's vice president , tomasz perkowski , called the program a kind of financial " airbag " to help returning poles deal with the shock of going from well-financed elite universities abroad to poland 's sluggish academic sector . " time abroad is very important for an academic career and we do n't want to create any barriers , " he said .
" but we also want the academics to have a reason to come back . " thirty polish students have benefited from the scholarship so far .
but for agnieszka that 's just a drop in the bucket . " only a few people get a scholarship like that , " she said .
" in relation to our population and especially considering that we want more young people to study at universities , it 's just not enough . " nadine wojcik -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a winner at the cannes film festival last year , the movie - called " auf der andern seite " in german - went on to win four more awards at the german film academy 's ceremony in berlin on friday , april 25 : gold for best film , best director , best script - all for akin - and a best editing prize for andrew bird .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin has been critical of the german film academy in the past " danke , danke , danke , " said a grateful akin , a hamburg-based director of turkish descent whose hard-hitting films about the struggles and confusion of turkish immigrants in germany have won also honors at the berlin and cannes film festivals .
" it 's extraordinarily difficult to measure art in any way , " said akin , 34 , whose 2003 film " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- also drew international accolades .
" so i 'm delighted , " he said at a gala with more than 1,500 spectators broadcast live on television .
" we do n't make films for prizes but rather for life . "
the young director has often criticized the german film academy in the past for the way it selects its lola nominees .
silver lola for doris doerrie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cherry blossoms " was considered a favorite for the golden lola " kirschblueten " -lrb- cherry blossoms -rrb- - a moving love story about a cranky bavarian civil servant who travels to japan after to fulfill the dream of his dead wife - by director doris doerrie , had led the field with six nominations , but won just two for best actor -lrb- elmar wepper -rrb- and best costume design .
" kirschblueten " also won the silver lola for best picture .
surprise box-office hit " die welle " -lrb- the wave -rrb- by dennis gansel , a drama set in modern germany , in which one charismatic teacher 's experiment turns a high school into a paradigm of a dictatorship , took the bronze lola in the best picture category .
bettina bluemner 's " princesses ' swimming pool " - a portrait of three teenage girls living in berlin 's multicultural kreuzberg district - won the prize for best documentary .
armin voelckers ' movie " leroy " - a movie about an afro-german teen who falls in love with girl from a right-wing extremist family - picked up the children and youth film lola .
german oscars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the wave " won the bronze lola for best film more than 1,000 industry professionals - members of the german film academy - cast the ballots for the 3-million-euro -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- german film prize .
the government underwrites the prizes to be distributed among the nominated films , as a kind of subsidy for future projects .
in 2006 , florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " - a film about an east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the totalitarian system he has worked to uphold - won seven lolas before later winning an oscar for best foreign film .
the lolas , which are seen as germany 's answer to hollywood 's oscars , have been presented since 1951 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem . a common " organ pool " and a single transplantation hotline are also among the proposed measures passed by the european parliament last week .
the european parliament also urged effective measures to be introduced to stop the trade in organs , calling for the 27-states to ensure that organ donations were made " without any self-interest and voluntarily " and no payments were made to the donors .
it was agreed the commercial use of organs was not defensible and represented an " violation of human dignity . "

"
" in developing countries and also in poor eu countries like romania and bulgaria , patients are often encouraged to put their health at risk , " said liese . some 40,000 patients are currently awaiting transplants in western europe alone , according to a parliamentary report .

germany has a middle ranking of some 16 organs per million citizens .
part of the reason for this are the differing legal requirements .
in germany and the netherlands , for example , there is an opt-in system , whereas in spain and belgium you have to opt out .
the european commission believe the introduction of a european donor card - combined with an awareness-raising campaign - could help boost the number of people willing to donate their organs .
it could close the gap between what people say and what they do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.04.2008 politics does n't belong at olympics , says un sport advisor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are , above all , a festival for the athletes , said lemke un special advisor on sport willi lemke said an olympic boycott would n't achieve anything and would just hurt the athletes .
the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .

that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .

those who stay at home are labeled " desperados " and often earn so little , regardless of how many degrees they have , that they can hardly survive . agnieszka koscianska just defended her dissertation last month and now works full-time as a lecturer at the university of warsaw 's sociology institute .
she gives three seminars and one lecture every week - for a monthly salary of around 300 euros -lrb- $ 475 -rrb- . the 32-year-old is frustrated . " first you study hard and do a doctorate ; you can speak several languages and work a lot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.04.2008 europe-wide organ donor card aims to slash death rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials are hoping to turn words into action more than 3,500 eu citizens died last year because they did not get a donor organ in time .
now the eu is planning to introduce a pan-european donor card to address the problem . a common " organ pool " and a single transplantation hotline are also among the proposed measures passed by the european parliament last week .
the european parliament also urged effective measures to be introduced to stop the trade in organs , calling for the 27-states to ensure that organ donations were made " without any self-interest and voluntarily " and no payments were made to the donors .
it was agreed the commercial use of organs was not defensible and represented an " violation of human dignity . "
citizens of poorer countries need protected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are squeamish about the idea of signing away their organs european parliamentarian peter liese -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the illegal organ trade would undermine the credibility of the planned donor system and also stressed the importance of stopping " transplantation tourism . "
" in developing countries and also in poor eu countries like romania and bulgaria , patients are often encouraged to put their health at risk , " said liese . some 40,000 patients are currently awaiting transplants in western europe alone , according to a parliamentary report .
the death rate for those waiting for a heart , lung or kidney transplant lies somewhere between 15 and 30 percent .
a mixed picture across the continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national donor cards like this one would be replaced by a europe-wide scheme donation rates vary widely across europe .
in spain , about 35 people out of a million donate their organs , while in eastern european countries the rate is a mere 0.8 .
germany has a middle ranking of some 16 organs per million citizens .
part of the reason for this are the differing legal requirements .
in germany and the netherlands , for example , there is an opt-in system , whereas in spain and belgium you have to opt out .
the european commission believe the introduction of a european donor card - combined with an awareness-raising campaign - could help boost the number of people willing to donate their organs .
it could close the gap between what people say and what they do .
according to an eu survey , some 80 percent are in favor of donor cards , but only 12 percent actually own one . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those who stay at home are labeled " desperados " and often earn so little , regardless of how many degrees they have , that they can hardly survive . agnieszka koscianska just defended her dissertation last month and now works full-time as a lecturer at the university of warsaw 's sociology institute .
she gives three seminars and one lecture every week - for a monthly salary of around 300 euros -lrb- $ 475 -rrb- . the 32-year-old is frustrated . " first you study hard and do a doctorate ; you can speak several languages and work a lot .
but in the end you earn about the same as a cleaning lady - with all due respect for their work , " she said . agnieszka has made a name for herself with her research in the field of gender studies .
she has a long list of publications and is regularly invited to give radio and television interviews .
research trips in copenhagen and new york , made possible by scholarships , fill out her resume . if everyone left … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university in warsaw many of her fellow students have taken positions abroad , mainly due to the low pay in poland , but that 's not an option for agnieszka . " i 've often thought about a career abroad , but i decided to stay here for private and especially for ideological reasons , " she said .
" not everyone can go - then there would n't be any more lecturers at the university . " agnieszka has a few advantages : she shares living expenses with her boyfriend michal , who translates ukrainian literature for a living .
and her parents bought her an apartment when she started studying , so she does n't have to pay rent .
in warsaw , the cost of an apartment would exceed her monthly income . even so , she 'll have to get by until she completes her postdoctoral lecture qualification , since her financial situation is n't likely to change any time soon .
compared to other eu countries , poland does n't spend a lot on education - only 0.4 percent of its gross domestic product - despite criticism from politicians and academics .
that puts a low ceiling on salaries for lecturers and professors . financial aid for home-comers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time abroad is essential to an academic career the foundation for polish science wants to help ease the situation .
it has initiated some 20 programs aimed at supporting talented students , one of which - called " powroty / homing " - is especially aimed at young academics who return to poland . the foundation 's vice president , tomasz perkowski , called the program a kind of financial " airbag " to help returning poles deal with the shock of going from well-financed elite universities abroad to poland 's sluggish academic sector . " time abroad is very important for an academic career and we do n't want to create any barriers , " he said .
" but we also want the academics to have a reason to come back . " thirty polish students have benefited from the scholarship so far .
but for agnieszka that 's just a drop in the bucket . " only a few people get a scholarship like that , " she said .
" in relation to our population and especially considering that we want more young people to study at universities , it 's just not enough . " nadine wojcik -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.04.2008 politics does n't belong at olympics , says un sport advisor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are , above all , a festival for the athletes , said lemke un special advisor on sport willi lemke said an olympic boycott would n't achieve anything and would just hurt the athletes .
the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a winner at the cannes film festival last year , the movie - called " auf der andern seite " in german - went on to win four more awards at the german film academy 's ceremony in berlin on friday , april 25 : gold for best film , best director , best script - all for akin - and a best editing prize for andrew bird .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin has been critical of the german film academy in the past " danke , danke , danke , " said a grateful akin , a hamburg-based director of turkish descent whose hard-hitting films about the struggles and confusion of turkish immigrants in germany have won also honors at the berlin and cannes film festivals .
" it 's extraordinarily difficult to measure art in any way , " said akin , 34 , whose 2003 film " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- also drew international accolades .
" so i 'm delighted , " he said at a gala with more than 1,500 spectators broadcast live on television .
" we do n't make films for prizes but rather for life . "
the young director has often criticized the german film academy in the past for the way it selects its lola nominees .
silver lola for doris doerrie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cherry blossoms " was considered a favorite for the golden lola " kirschblueten " -lrb- cherry blossoms -rrb- - a moving love story about a cranky bavarian civil servant who travels to japan after to fulfill the dream of his dead wife - by director doris doerrie , had led the field with six nominations , but won just two for best actor -lrb- elmar wepper -rrb- and best costume design .
" kirschblueten " also won the silver lola for best picture .
surprise box-office hit " die welle " -lrb- the wave -rrb- by dennis gansel , a drama set in modern germany , in which one charismatic teacher 's experiment turns a high school into a paradigm of a dictatorship , took the bronze lola in the best picture category .
bettina bluemner 's " princesses ' swimming pool " - a portrait of three teenage girls living in berlin 's multicultural kreuzberg district - won the prize for best documentary .
armin voelckers ' movie " leroy " - a movie about an afro-german teen who falls in love with girl from a right-wing extremist family - picked up the children and youth film lola .
german oscars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the wave " won the bronze lola for best film more than 1,000 industry professionals - members of the german film academy - cast the ballots for the 3-million-euro -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- german film prize .
the government underwrites the prizes to be distributed among the nominated films , as a kind of subsidy for future projects .
in 2006 , florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " - a film about an east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the totalitarian system he has worked to uphold - won seven lolas before later winning an oscar for best foreign film .
the lolas , which are seen as germany 's answer to hollywood 's oscars , have been presented since 1951 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier german newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday that farhang had been the ultimate target of a spying operation that also involved susanne koelbl , one of its journalists .
president of the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , apologized to koelbl for the activities of his agents , which experts say contravenes german law .
two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources .
it later apologized , calling it a one-off .
shocking revelation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrang 's communication with a german journalist was monitored by the bnd in an article written before the steinmeier-spanta phone call and released on saturday ahead of publication , der spiegel reported that spanta had in fact been outraged by the revelation .
" i am angry and repulsed by these methods that should not take place in a democracy , " spanta told the weekly .
he expressed shock that germany , which he saw as a close ally , would take action of this kind .
the german foreign ministry said steinmeier was still seeking to contact farhang , who studied in germany and speaks fluent german , to express his regrets personally .
disciplinary measures on thursday , chancellor angela merkel 's office ordered disciplinary measures be taken against three intelligence service members , including uhrlau and the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd president ernst uhrlau has been the target of intense criticism uhrlau was brought before the parliamentary control commission on wednesday and thursday and told of the bundestag 's displeasure . he has faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal , but the parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- stopped short of demanding he step down . farhang was angered by the revelation that he had been spied on , telling the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung that the implication that he was in complicity with the taliban had endangered him and his family .
another german daily , the mitteldeutsche zeitung , reported on saturday that other afghan ministers feared they had been monitored as well by the bnd , which had allegedly also eavesdropped on farhang 's phone calls .
six of the 20 afghan cabinet ministers have spent part of their lives in germany and speak german , the newspaper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.04.2008 politics does n't belong at olympics , says un sport advisor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are , above all , a festival for the athletes , said lemke un special advisor on sport willi lemke said an olympic boycott would n't achieve anything and would just hurt the athletes .
the ioc is the wrong address for human rights issues , he added . dw-world.de : mr. lemke , does the united nations consider the olympic games to be endangered by the conflict in tibet ? willi lemke : the united nations wants the olympic games in china to go peacefully and in the olympic spirit .
we want the games to take place in a way that brings people together and promotes the un 's millennium development goals .
that 's why we 'll be closely observing what happens in china over the next weeks and months . what are the aims of the un millennium goals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke said the un does n't support an olympic boycott there are eight development goals that should be reached by the year 2015 .
one of them is fighting poverty in the world .
education for everyone , equality , climate and environmental protection , and human rights are also included . human rights are not just a burning topic in china but in the whole world .
of course , the focus is on china right now because of the olympic games .
that 's why the united nations is interested in the progress that 's been made there in the last few months and years .
but the developments of the last months have also raised a lot of new questions . what position does the un take in discussions about a possible boycott of the olympic games ? we can not endorse a boycott ; we 're of the same opinion as the international olympic committee .
a boycott would affect the athletes most of all , which would be unthinkable for us . the united nations very much wants it to be a big celebration for the athletes .
but sports always take place within a society .
the soccer world cup in germany , for example , was a grandiose success , not just from an athletic but also a political point of view .
germany presented soccer in a wonderful way - and it 's just the same with china .
everyone was aware of china 's form of government when the ioc awarded them the games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lemke compared the olympics to the world cup a boycott would above all affect the athletes from all over the world who have trained for the event over the past few years .
besides , similar boycotts have never achieved anything relevant in the past .
there definitely wo n't be a majority at the ioc or at the un who support a boycott of the games . what can athletes do against human rights violations ? unfortunately , human rights are violated in many countries in the world .
it 's wrong to push this problem off onto the ioc .
these issues should be brought up with political bodies , human rights organizations and the un . i think it 's the wrong approach to demand that sports organizations solve these political problems just a few weeks before the olympic games .
but it is the view of the ioc that the athletes - as responsible citizens - have the right to express themselves on political issues .
we do n't want to silence the athletes .
but political topics should n't be discussed in the context of a sports competition . international regulations have been laid down to ensure that the event locations remain free from demonstrations .
it should be a festival for the athletes , not just in terms of sports but also as a sign of friendship between nations .
when 25,000 journalists and lots of athletes from around the world meet in beijing , there will be many possibilities for communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics should be a success for china , said lemke what can the un special advisor on sport do to help make the olympic games a success ? un secretary general ban ki-moon has given me three tasks .
first , i am to advocate sports as an instrument to promote development and peace and represent the interests of sports and , above all , the secretary general , in the un .
secondly , i should play a representative role .
when ban ki-moon is n't able to participate in large sports events , i will take his place , accompany or advise him . thirdly , i should serve as a mediator between the media , the international olympic committee , the united nations and the event organizers .
the olympic games should be a success for the chinese and for the whole world .
but the games are n't just an event for the chinese , but also for the sports world and the international olympic committee . we want to bring people together and not draw them apart . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only 1,000 of 3,200 licensed gambling firms have donated money , says the responsibility in gambling trust .
the trust has reached its target of £ 3.6m in voluntary donations - but says many firms have not given anything .
the culture secretary has previously said the government may introduce a compulsory levy .
the money is used to treat problem gamblers and to fund research into gambling addiction . "
all we have available to us are the names and addresses of operators .
we do n't have the information about what they do or how big they are . "
john greenway , rigt chairman this year , the trust has raised £ 100,000 more than the original £ 3.5m target .
but the trust says the money came mainly from the larger companies , such as the big high street betting firms and casino operators .
this means the majority of smaller licensed gambling operators , including casinos , bookies , bingo halls and gambling websites , gave nothing .

" we sent around 3,200 letters twice , but all we have available to us are the names and addresses of operators .

" i think we can , but i think those parts of the industry which have been most generous to us want to make sure they 're not subsidising non-payers . "
but ian semell from the gambling therapy website doubts that extra money can be raised using current methods - and he thinks there is a need for much more funding .
" perhaps they need to have somebody out there actively campaigning and getting to know the people that run these companies , and using a salesman technique to go out there and actually ask people for money .

only 1,000 of 3,200 licensed gambling firms have donated money , says the responsibility in gambling trust .
the trust has reached its target of £ 3.6m in voluntary donations - but says many firms have not given anything .
the culture secretary has previously said the government may introduce a compulsory levy .
the money is used to treat problem gamblers and to fund research into gambling addiction .
all we have available to us are the names and addresses of operators .
we do n't have the information about what they do or how big they are .
john greenway , rigt chairman this year , the trust has raised £ 100,000 more than the original £ 3.5m target .
but the trust says the money came mainly from the larger companies , such as the big high street betting firms and casino operators .
this means the majority of smaller licensed gambling operators , including casinos , bookies , bingo halls and gambling websites , gave nothing .
rigt chairman john greenway says all it can do is write to companies to remind them of their responsibilities .
" we sent around 3,200 letters twice , but all we have available to us are the names and addresses of operators .
we do n't have the information about what they do or how big they are , " he said .
the gambling commission review will be published in autumn despite this , mr greenway remains optimistic about reaching their target of £ 7m in voluntary contributions by 2010 .
" i think we can , but i think those parts of the industry which have been most generous to us want to make sure they 're not subsidising non-payers . "

this means the majority of smaller licensed gambling operators , including casinos , bookies , bingo halls and gambling websites , gave nothing .
rigt chairman john greenway says all it can do is write to companies to remind them of their responsibilities .
" we sent around 3,200 letters twice , but all we have available to us are the names and addresses of operators .
we do n't have the information about what they do or how big they are , " he said .
the gambling commission review will be published in autumn despite this , mr greenway remains optimistic about reaching their target of £ 7m in voluntary contributions by 2010 .
" i think we can , but i think those parts of the industry which have been most generous to us want to make sure they 're not subsidising non-payers . "
but ian semell from the gambling therapy website doubts that extra money can be raised using current methods - and he thinks there is a need for much more funding .
" perhaps they need to have somebody out there actively campaigning and getting to know the people that run these companies , and using a salesman technique to go out there and actually ask people for money .
" because at the end of the day , if they do n't contribute , i 'm sure there will be an enforced levy , " he said .
' not acceptable ' successive culture secretaries have threatened a compulsory levy if the industry does not contribute more .
most recently , andy burnham said in february that he was surprised by the low level of donations - at that point only 360 firms had contributed .
he said it was not acceptable , and asked the industry to deliver a substantial increase in contributions or face a statutory levy .
it 's difficult to get money out of these people - some of them are operating from overseas don foster lib dem culture spokesman liberal democrat culture spokesman don foster told bbc radio 5 live that problem gambling was " a major and growing problem " .
he said the amount contributed was about £ 14 per problem gambler in the uk , compared with £ 44 in new zealand and £ 40 in canada .
" it 's the online gamblers on the whole who are not contributing , " mr foster said .
" it 's difficult to get money out of these people - some of them are operating from overseas .
" we 've got to say once and for all , ' here is the amount we want - £ 7m plus , in a couple of years ' .
" let 's use that as the threat to the industry .
cough up double what 's being paid now or else we have a compulsory levy to raise that amount of money . "
the gambling commission is currently reviewing the effectiveness and level of the current voluntary arrangements for the gambling industry 's funding for gambling research , treatment and public education .
its findings , due to be published this autumn , will be taken into account by the department of culture , media and sport and will affect the likelihood of a compulsory levy .

it 's time to go on safari . "
the clock says 5.30 .
getting out of bed and opening the flaps of the tent , you pause for a while on the small veranda .
the vista is stunning : flat open fields with the gentle curve of the coast and soft blue of the sea in the middle distance .
close by , some giraffes lope past , and the wildebeest are grazing by the watering hole .
southern africa ?
kenya ?
no .
try a bit closer to home .
try kent .
for this is the " african " safari experience at lympne wildlife park near dover .
the idea is to recreate a mini-safari , with authentic lodge tents and african rangers , in 100 acres of land where more than 300 animals roam free .
warren cathro is the ranger and host on the two safaris you take on the overnight stay .
he 's got more than 20 years ' experience in conservation work in zimbabwe , and is never short of a tale of his exploits in africa , whether it 's catching black rhino or transporting giraffes by train .
" if you look at it in the context of what we have available here , it is very , very close - as close as you are going to get in europe , " he says .
" and if we can get parks like this functioning , and breeding up stock to send over to africa , there is hope for the wildlife out there . "
warren is talking about the crash in the african wildlife population , which is now being addressed by european wildlife parks .
money from these mini-safaris will go towards the conservation work at lympne .
it is the only conservation body in the world to be sending critically endangered black rhino back to african countries such as tanzania to help boost populations there .
it also has re-introduction programmes for gorillas in gabon in west africa .
obviously , it 's never going to be exactly like the african safari experience - predators such as cheetahs are going to be introduced , but they will be penned in , and wo n't be reacting with the herbivores -lrb- another thing that 's different about lympne and africa - health and safety requirements -rrb- .
but , the organisers say , it does give you a little slice of the work that is being done thousands of miles from the kentish coast .

madonna is not called the material girl for nothing .
last year 's highest earning musician , according to forbes magazine , has already made millions from her latest album hard candy - before it is even released .
that is because it has already proved a tasty proposition for advertisers .
madonna has added to her fortune by signing lucrative deals with three major companies ahead of hard candy 's release .
vodafone customers have had a chance to listen to seven tracks from the album already .
us tv viewers have been hearing a version of the number one single 4 minutes on an advert for shampoo since february .
and miles away -lrb- the album 's expected second single -rrb- is already a drama 's theme tune on japanese television .
according to claire beale , editor of advertising trade magazine campaign , it is a great move .
" madonna 's been really shrewd with this deal , " she says .
" she 's managed to piggyback a massive global ad spend .
the brand is spending millions of pounds reaching consumers and her music is there with it . "
and ms beale believes madonna , famous for keeping ahead of the trends , is breaking new ground in advertising .
" the difference here is that madonna is herself a big brand so it 's quite rare to find someone of her stature breaking one of their new tracks on a commercial soundtrack .
" and that 's part of the buzz about it , because we are all talking about it , so market value is enhanced dramatically . "
of course , not every artist has madonna 's track record - but getting onto a tv advert can pay off for musicians trying to break into the charts . "
it 's the best thing you can possibly have - as long as the ad is not too cheesy " jamie hartman ben 's brother british band ben 's brother ended up finding success in the states when their song stuttering -lrb- kiss me again -rrb- became the soundtrack to a chewing gum ad .
singer songwriter jamie hartman says : " it was one of those songs that randomly got chosen to be up for this commercial ahead of a track by muse .
" it ended up being a huge track for us .
people heard the song on the ad , went to find us on the net and suddenly they found us on a myspace page and things went a bit nuts .
" going from 200 hits a day on myspace , we went to 10,000 a day in the space of a week . "
the track has now been included on the band 's debut album beta male fairytales , which their record company has decided to re-release following this newfound success .
hartman says : " the great thing about advertising is it reaches million and millions of people and these big companies spend tens of millions of pounds , which usually the record companies do n't necessarily want to spend themselves .
" it works both ways really .
it 's the best thing you can possibly have , as long as the ad is not too cheesy , which luckily this one was n't . "
perhaps the ultimate union between a brand and band is dance act groove armada 's new deal .
after leaving record company sony bmg , groove armada 's andy cato and tom findlay signed an all encompassing deal with bacardi rum .
the dj duo are being paid an unspecified wage and the drinksmaker funds their new material .
in return , bacardi will be allowed to use groove armada 's latest tracks in their advertising campaigns - but will not retain the copyright , which remains with the dance act .
it is the kind of deal that new company harvest entertainment has been set up to broker . "
you no longer have to sign with a major record label to be successful and earn revenues " ric salmon harvest entertainment with more than 50 years of experience in the record industry , its directors are looking at new ways to bring music to the masses through partnerships between brands and bands .
managing director ric salmon explains : " when artists get to the end of their deals , they now have a choice and it 's as simple as that .
" because of that , we are living in an incredible most revolutionary time , the music industry has ever seen .
artists have now got a choice , and there a now three or four routes an artist can take . "
his business partner matt jagger agrees : " you no longer have to sign with a major record label to be successful and earn revenues .
" and this is one of the new routes to market that an artist can take .
some are going down a venture capital route , some artists are signing with a live agency .
" this is pairing an artist with a like minded consumer brand who they can work with as a route to market . "
the company is currently finding brand partnership deals for madness , placebo and mcfly .
any suggestion that bands are selling out to big business are quickly quashed by mr salmon .
" a good example is the prince and mail on sunday deal , " he says .
" a phenomenal way of three million people getting his album for free .
" i do n't think as a consumer he was selling out .
it seized an incredible consumer opportunity , to get three million albums on the coffee table . "
mr jagger adds : " and -lsb- it -rsb- was a great deal for the artist because his previous album had sold 100,000 . "

last year 's highest earning musician , according to forbes magazine , has already made millions from her latest album hard candy - before it is even released .
that is because it has already proved a tasty proposition for advertisers .
madonna has added to her fortune by signing lucrative deals with three major companies ahead of hard candy 's release .
vodafone customers have had a chance to listen to seven tracks from the album already .
us tv viewers have been hearing a version of the number one single 4 minutes on an advert for shampoo since february .
and miles away -lrb- the album 's expected second single -rrb- is already a drama 's theme tune on japanese television .
according to claire beale , editor of advertising trade magazine campaign , it is a great move .
ben 's brother got their big break when their music was used on a tv ad " madonna 's been really shrewd with this deal , " she says .
" she 's managed to piggyback a massive global ad spend .
the brand is spending millions of pounds reaching consumers and her music is there with it . "
and ms beale believes madonna , famous for keeping ahead of the trends , is breaking new ground in advertising .
" the difference here is that madonna is herself a big brand so it 's quite rare to find someone of her stature breaking one of their new tracks on a commercial soundtrack .
" and that 's part of the buzz about it , because we are all talking about it , so market value is enhanced dramatically . "
of course , not every artist has madonna 's track record - but getting onto a tv advert can pay off for musicians trying to break into the charts .
it 's the best thing you can possibly have - as long as the ad is not too cheesy jamie hartman ben 's brother british band ben 's brother ended up finding success in the states when their song stuttering -lrb- kiss me again -rrb- became the soundtrack to a chewing gum ad .
singer songwriter jamie hartman says : " it was one of those songs that randomly got chosen to be up for this commercial ahead of a track by muse .
" it ended up being a huge track for us .
people heard the song on the ad , went to find us on the net and suddenly they found us on a myspace page and things went a bit nuts .
" going from 200 hits a day on myspace , we went to 10,000 a day in the space of a week . "
the track has now been included on the band 's debut album beta male fairytales , which their record company has decided to re-release following this newfound success .
hartman says : " the great thing about advertising is it reaches million and millions of people and these big companies spend tens of millions of pounds , which usually the record companies do n't necessarily want to spend themselves .
bacardi will use groove armada tracks in their ad campaigns " it works both ways really .
it 's the best thing you can possibly have , as long as the ad is not too cheesy , which luckily this one was n't . "
perhaps the ultimate union between a brand and band is dance act groove armada 's new deal .
after leaving record company sony bmg , groove armada 's andy cato and tom findlay signed an all encompassing deal with bacardi rum .
the dj duo are being paid an unspecified wage and the drinksmaker funds their new material .
in return , bacardi will be allowed to use groove armada 's latest tracks in their advertising campaigns - but will not retain the copyright , which remains with the dance act .
it is the kind of deal that new company harvest entertainment has been set up to broker .

managing director ric salmon explains : " when artists get to the end of their deals , they now have a choice and it 's as simple as that .
" because of that , we are living in an incredible most revolutionary time , the music industry has ever seen .
artists have now got a choice , and there a now three or four routes an artist can take . "
his business partner matt jagger agrees : " you no longer have to sign with a major record label to be successful and earn revenues .
" and this is one of the new routes to market that an artist can take .
