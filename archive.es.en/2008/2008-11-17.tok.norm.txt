some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .
" the only clear signal from this g20 was the acceleration of the birth of a new world order , " the italian paper said , noting that the only participants that held the financial reserves to take part in re-launching the international monetary fund were saudi arabia and china . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will demand that the trial be open , " politkovskaya 's son ilya politkovsky told the news agency afp .
" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial .

" we will demand that the trial be open , " politkovskaya 's son ilya politkovsky told the news agency afp .
" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial . " one of the four defendants in the case , pavel ryaguzov , is a federal security service agent , meaning special attention will likely go towards keeping the minutia of the case out of public reach . ryaguzov is suspected of having provided politkovskaya 's home address to her killers and is charged with abuse of office .
three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .
she was a prominent investigative journalist in russia 's tightly controlled media landscape . her stories for bi-weekly publication novaya gazeta focused mainly on human rights abuses committed by russian troops and pro-moscow militias in conflict-torn chechnya . case politicized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya fiercely opposed the conflict in chechnya the case has received significant attention in the international media , but many fear stoppers have been placed on the investigation 's progress . " based on experience , we know that this type of case is never resolved in our country , " said boris tymoshenko of the glasnost defense foundation .
but it 's still positive that at least a part of the case has gone to court this time . " he said there was " an absence of political will " for cases of this nature . igor yakovenko , who represents the russian journalists ' association , said the russian government has not been pushing for answers to politkovskaya 's murder . " politkovskaya 's colleagues are content with the work of investigators looking into the murder .
but the officials have encountered problems and the investigation has been politicized , " he told deutsche welle . unknown killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya , politkovskaya 's son , has called for a public trial two years after her murder , both politkovskaya 's killer and the individual who are thought to have ordered it are still at large . it is believed a man named rustam makhmudov was contracted to kill the journalist and has since fled russia .
the person who ordered the killing has never been identified . " i do n't have any hope that the name of the person who ordered the killing will be revealed ... the people who will be tried do n't have direct contact with him , it 's a criminal group that did this for the money , " politkovsky said . two of the defendants , chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov - brothers to rustam makhmudov - are accused of having followed politkovskaya in her last weeks . the fourth defendant , sergei khadzhikurbanov , is a former police investigator from the moscow police 's organized crime unit . russia is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists to work in , with 49 killed since 1992 . the new york-based committee to protect journalists ranks the federation third deadliest for journalists after iraq and algeria . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .
fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .

fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .

he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .

for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .
but that was n't the information heilmann objected to in the online biography of him on wikipedia .
he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .

importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .

no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 17.11.2008 archrivals germany and england gear up for friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " friendlies " between rivals germany and england do n't always remain friendly another chapter in one of the oldest rivalries in international soccer will be written this week as england and germany lock horns in an international friendly in berlin on wednesday . the two nations , whose histories are inextricably linked by the 1966 world cup final , won by england on home soil , have met 26 times in all , including the period when germany played as west germany . of those , england have won 11 , the germans have won 10 and there have been five draws . despite their 1966 triumph - which remains their only major tournament win - england have suffered plenty of heartbreak at the hands of the germans , going down to them on penalties in both the semi-finals of the world cup in 1990 and in the 1996 european championships . a famous 5-1 win by england in a world cup qualifier in munich in 2001 wiped away many of the bad memories , although the germans did win their last encounter , another friendly in 2007 . this time , both sides are in something of a transition period .
england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .

with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .
" i remember the first time we played against switzerland and we played without confidence . " but now we have played and won four qualifiers for the world cup , and i can see the confidence in the players .
this is the most important thing . " injuries on german side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial third goal in the germany-england game of 1966 germany will be without chelsea midfielder michael ballack , who has only just returned from injury , and also torsten frings , who had criticized manager loew after he was dropped from the squad to play wales and russia in world cup qualifying matches . defenders philipp lahm , marcell jansen , christian pander and clemens fritz are all unavailable through injury , so loew is likely to follow capello 's example by experimenting with some relatively unknown players at international level . " we want to use the last game of the year to try a few things out and to look at some new players , " loew said .
" the three new members of the squad have earned their place through their achievements . " police on alert german police say they expect around 8,000 england fans to come to berlin for the friendly , most of whom have tickets for the match at berlin 's olympic stadium .
still , police say around 250 known troublemakers are expected to come to germany without tickets , and they are prepared for possible trouble . bildunterschrift : the germany and england teams some 4,500 police officers are to be in the german capital on wednesday night to deal with any disturbances . " we have prepared our deployments of officers as carefully as possible for this game , because disturbances can not be excluded , " said a berlin police spokesman . german police also expect some trouble from home-grown hooligans and say they have issued warnings to about 80 individuals with a history of hooliganism . british and german police forces have exchanged information in recent months and known hooligans who come to germany will be detained at the point of entry .
german officials are posting english-speaking police at railway stations and two berlin airports to meet arriving england fans . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.11.2008 no ' polish plumber ' wave - migration low after eu expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the hopes of probably more than a few french , polish plumbers like this one did not overrun france like an anti-eu campaign had warned contrary to popular belief , the european union 's expansion towards central and eastern europe has not sparked a massive influx of polish plumbers or bulgarian builders to the bloc 's richest nations , figures due out tuesd according to the european commission 's latest report , more and more workers from the eu 's 12 newest member states have been relocating to germany or britain since being allowed to move freely around the 27-member bloc . however , their numbers remain small in relative terms .
in fact , the eu 's richer nations continue to receive a far higher share of foreign immigrants from the developing world . for instance , the number of bulgarians and romanians who found a job in one of the eu 's 15 older member states grew to 1.6 million in 2007 , up from 1.3 million in 2006 - when those two countries were not yet part of the eu .
most of them have headed to spain and italy . but bulgarians and romanians still account for just 0.4 percent of the total population of the eu 's richest nations , compared to 0.3 percent in 2006 . meanwhile , citizens from poland and from the other nine countries that joined the eu in 2004 now account for 0.5 percent of the resident population of the eu 's richest nations , up from 0.3 percent in 2004 .
of the about 2 million who have left their home country , most have moved to ireland and britain . non-eu immigration up by contrast , the number of non-eu citizens now living in the eu-15 has increased from 14 million in 2003 to 17.4 million in 2007 . concerns about the invasion of " polish plumbers " - a symbol of cheap labor - are thought to have played a major role in convincing many french to vote " no " in 2005 in a referendum on the now defunct eu constitution . but commission figures show that the share of foreign residents from new eu member states has remained stable at 0.1 percent since 2003 . officials in brussels were expected to conclude on the basis of the report that enlargement has not led to major disturbances to the labor markets of the eu 's richest member states . despite this , austria and germany are still considering extending limits on the influx of workers from some of the new eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .

the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .
" the only clear signal from this g20 was the acceleration of the birth of a new world order , " the italian paper said , noting that the only participants that held the financial reserves to take part in re-launching the international monetary fund were saudi arabia and china . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .
" the only clear signal from this g20 was the acceleration of the birth of a new world order , " the italian paper said , noting that the only participants that held the financial reserves to take part in re-launching the international monetary fund were saudi arabia and china . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial . " one of the four defendants in the case , pavel ryaguzov , is a federal security service agent , meaning special attention will likely go towards keeping the minutia of the case out of public reach . ryaguzov is suspected of having provided politkovskaya 's home address to her killers and is charged with abuse of office .
three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .
she was a prominent investigative journalist in russia 's tightly controlled media landscape . her stories for bi-weekly publication novaya gazeta focused mainly on human rights abuses committed by russian troops and pro-moscow militias in conflict-torn chechnya . case politicized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya fiercely opposed the conflict in chechnya the case has received significant attention in the international media , but many fear stoppers have been placed on the investigation 's progress .

but the officials have encountered problems and the investigation has been politicized , " he told deutsche welle . unknown killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya , politkovskaya 's son , has called for a public trial two years after her murder , both politkovskaya 's killer and the individual who are thought to have ordered it are still at large . it is believed a man named rustam makhmudov was contracted to kill the journalist and has since fled russia .
the person who ordered the killing has never been identified . " i do n't have any hope that the name of the person who ordered the killing will be revealed ... the people who will be tried do n't have direct contact with him , it 's a criminal group that did this for the money , " politkovsky said . two of the defendants , chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov - brothers to rustam makhmudov - are accused of having followed politkovskaya in her last weeks . the fourth defendant , sergei khadzhikurbanov , is a former police investigator from the moscow police 's organized crime unit . russia is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists to work in , with 49 killed since 1992 . the new york-based committee to protect journalists ranks the federation third deadliest for journalists after iraq and algeria . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal allows for officials from the eu and china to carry out coordinated checks on producers to ensure safety standards are being met . chinese officials will also be given access to the eu 's rapid alert system for feed and food -lrb- rasff -rrb- , where authorities can exchange information about what measures are being taken to ensure food safety . the deal " substantially strengthens the systems of safety controls for product and food safety between the eu and china , " said consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva . after the agreement was signed , nancy a. nord from the us consumer product safety commission joined her counterparts from the eu and china to consider possible three-way cooperation which could include common safety standards for toys . the european commission says half of all dangerous products seized by european authorities last year came from china . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.11.2008 fierce clashes in dr congo despite ceasefire promises : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no end in sight to hostilities that have caused a humanitarian disaster in dr congo the congolese army and tutsi rebels have engaged in some of the worst clashes for a week despite rebel leader laurent nkunda saying he supports peace in eastern democratic republic of congo , the un said monday . there was heavy firing between nkunda 's national congress for the defence of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and the congolese army from early afternoon sunday until late evening , lieutenant colonel jean-paul dietrich , military spokesman for the un peacekeeping mission in dr congo , told german news agency dpa .
" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .
fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .
fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .
fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.11.2008 german mp 's wikipedia lockdown unleashes flood of donations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocked wikipedia deutschland users showed their support with increased donations leftist german politician lutz heilmann inadvertently marred his reputation by taking legal action intended to preserve it , inciting hundreds of blocked users to make donations to free online information forum wikipedia . lutz heilmann , a member of the german parliament , or bundestag , objected to certain information contained about him in an online article posted at german wikipedia , so he hired a lawyer and had the site shut down .
for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .
but that was n't the information heilmann objected to in the online biography of him on wikipedia .
he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .
men however are in favour of the treaty by 48 per cent compared to 38 per cent who plan to vote " no " , with the remaining15 percent having no opinion . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "

ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .

gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance .

but the government made no promises , and gave no cash . merkel said after meeting with leaders of adam opel gmbh that it was " not yet determined " whether the automaker would be given one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government . opel is seeking credit guarantees from berlin to counter a financial squeeze , triggered by dwindling sales and problems with its parent company general motors . taking part in the meeting at the chancellor 's office were opel chief executive hans demant , the head of gm 's european operations carl-peter forster and the head of the company 's employees ' council klaus franz . opel was expected to present details of its financial situation and explain why it needed the government to stump up an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in guarantees . merkel said that government officials planned further talks on the issue and should make a decision by christmas . industry-wide aid rejected finance minister peer steinbrueck , who also took part in the talks , earlier ruled out a general program to stimulate the country 's automobile industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , left , and glos are wary of a state aid package for opel " the state can not act as a replacement for private consumption and is not responsible for the errors of the industry , " he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper . economy minister michael glos had also voiced opposition earlier to a bail-out plan for the industry , hit by a major drop in sales due to the global economic slowdown . an opel spokesman has said the carmaker would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of gm deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary were affected . gm could get the cash ? glos , who was also at monday 's meeting , expressed concern that any financial support for opel could find its way to gm , which is facing a serious cash shortage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm , opel 's american parent , is hurting badly " we certainly have to know whether the money will remain in germany , " glos told german television .
" issues related to the american parent still need to be cleared up . " the us congress was due to meet this week do discuss a request by gm and fellow automakers ford and chrysler for billions of dollars in emergency aid to help them out of the current crisis . close to one-in-five workers are employed directly or indirectly in the german automobile sector . opel employs 25,700 workers at four factories in germany , but experts say an additional 50,000 jobs would be at stake if the company were allowed to go to the wall .
along with other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw , opel has announced temporary plant closures after a huge drop in orders . setting a precedent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short-term forecast is not great for opel the state governments of hesse , north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate , where opel manufacturing plants are located , have signalled a willingness to participate in loan guarantees . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin wanted to avoid setting a precedent .
he said the government would do all it could to help the ailing carmaker , but had to take into consideration eu regulations governing competition and subsidies . analysts said granting state aid to a single company could be viewed as discriminatory by brussels and meet with opposition .
eu competition regulators might take a dim view of any state help to opel because of it being deemed unfair to other european carmakers such as france 's renault or italy 's fiat . the german parliament last week approved a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars as part of a 12-billion-euro package designed to stimulate domestic consumption . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .

" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .

the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .

" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order .

the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .

iceland will repay thousands of foreign savers who had money in now-frozen accounts the european commission on monday said the agreement reached with several eu states on how to repay thousands of foreigns who had accounts in iceland paves the way for aid to start flowing to the country , including a package from the international monetary fund worth as much as $ 6 billion . those accounts have been at the center of a tensions between iceland and its european neighbors .
britain and the netherlands have been delaying the imf package , which has deprived iceland of badly needed funds to revive its currency trade and restart the economy . " we welcome the announcement by iceland that it will apply eu rules on the protection of bank deposits , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for the european commission , said at a press conference on monday . imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday that the lender would finalize a rescue package for iceland on nov .

it stipulates that retail and wholesale depositors are entitled to about 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,290 -rrb- per account . economic meltdown the global financial crisis has led to the collapse of iceland 's currency , the crown , and the government took over three of its largest banks . haarde told parliament recently that the country 's public debt would increase from 29 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- at the end of 2007 to just over 100 percent of gdp at the end of 2009 . the cost of the banking crisis could be as high as 85 percent of gdp , or 1.1 trillion kronur -lrb- 7.2 billion euros , 9.4 billion dollars -rrb- , he said . frosty relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister geir haarde of iceland relations between iceland and britain and the netherlands , in particular , have been strained over the issue of savers who had no more access to money desposited in the icesave accounts of landsbanki , one of the banks that collapsed last month . about 300,000 britons had accounts in icesave , totalling about $ 6 billion .
the uk government had used anti-terrorist legislation to freeze the assets of collapsing icelandic banks in a bid to protect british savers ' deposits . the dutch finance ministry said last month it had reached an agreement in principle under which iceland would reimburse dutch savers for up to 20,887 euros -lrb- $ 26,490 -rrb- per person for money deposited with icesave . the netherlands said it would extend a loan of 1.3 billion euros to iceland to make this possible .
dutch authorities would then compensate depositors for anything above that amount up to 100,000 euros . but as of the end of last week , a dutch finance ministry spokeswoman said the legal documents to flesh out the memorandum of understanding had not been finalized . the weekend agreement did not make it immediately clear how the icebank deposits would be covered .
the total amount is estimated to be about 600 billion icelandic crowns -lrb- 3.5 billion euros -rrb- .
haarde said he hoped other countries would help cover the costs , and that additional funds could be raised by selling off the bank 's assets . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 17.11.2008 european press review : media questions merits of g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european editorial writers had different opinions on the outcome of the g20 summit reaction to the impact of the g20 summit was mixed in the european media .
some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .
" the only clear signal from this g20 was the acceleration of the birth of a new world order , " the italian paper said , noting that the only participants that held the financial reserves to take part in re-launching the international monetary fund were saudi arabia and china . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will demand that the trial be open , " politkovskaya 's son ilya politkovsky told the news agency afp .
" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial . " one of the four defendants in the case , pavel ryaguzov , is a federal security service agent , meaning special attention will likely go towards keeping the minutia of the case out of public reach . ryaguzov is suspected of having provided politkovskaya 's home address to her killers and is charged with abuse of office .
three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .
she was a prominent investigative journalist in russia 's tightly controlled media landscape . her stories for bi-weekly publication novaya gazeta focused mainly on human rights abuses committed by russian troops and pro-moscow militias in conflict-torn chechnya . case politicized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya fiercely opposed the conflict in chechnya the case has received significant attention in the international media , but many fear stoppers have been placed on the investigation 's progress . " based on experience , we know that this type of case is never resolved in our country , " said boris tymoshenko of the glasnost defense foundation .
but it 's still positive that at least a part of the case has gone to court this time . " he said there was " an absence of political will " for cases of this nature . igor yakovenko , who represents the russian journalists ' association , said the russian government has not been pushing for answers to politkovskaya 's murder . " politkovskaya 's colleagues are content with the work of investigators looking into the murder .
but the officials have encountered problems and the investigation has been politicized , " he told deutsche welle . unknown killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya , politkovskaya 's son , has called for a public trial two years after her murder , both politkovskaya 's killer and the individual who are thought to have ordered it are still at large . it is believed a man named rustam makhmudov was contracted to kill the journalist and has since fled russia .
the person who ordered the killing has never been identified . " i do n't have any hope that the name of the person who ordered the killing will be revealed ... the people who will be tried do n't have direct contact with him , it 's a criminal group that did this for the money , " politkovsky said . two of the defendants , chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov - brothers to rustam makhmudov - are accused of having followed politkovskaya in her last weeks . the fourth defendant , sergei khadzhikurbanov , is a former police investigator from the moscow police 's organized crime unit . russia is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists to work in , with 49 killed since 1992 . the new york-based committee to protect journalists ranks the federation third deadliest for journalists after iraq and algeria . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will demand that the trial be open , " politkovskaya 's son ilya politkovsky told the news agency afp .
" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial . " one of the four defendants in the case , pavel ryaguzov , is a federal security service agent , meaning special attention will likely go towards keeping the minutia of the case out of public reach . ryaguzov is suspected of having provided politkovskaya 's home address to her killers and is charged with abuse of office .
three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .
she was a prominent investigative journalist in russia 's tightly controlled media landscape . her stories for bi-weekly publication novaya gazeta focused mainly on human rights abuses committed by russian troops and pro-moscow militias in conflict-torn chechnya . case politicized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya fiercely opposed the conflict in chechnya the case has received significant attention in the international media , but many fear stoppers have been placed on the investigation 's progress .

but it 's still positive that at least a part of the case has gone to court this time . " he said there was " an absence of political will " for cases of this nature . igor yakovenko , who represents the russian journalists ' association , said the russian government has not been pushing for answers to politkovskaya 's murder . " politkovskaya 's colleagues are content with the work of investigators looking into the murder .
but the officials have encountered problems and the investigation has been politicized , " he told deutsche welle . unknown killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya , politkovskaya 's son , has called for a public trial two years after her murder , both politkovskaya 's killer and the individual who are thought to have ordered it are still at large . it is believed a man named rustam makhmudov was contracted to kill the journalist and has since fled russia .
the person who ordered the killing has never been identified . " i do n't have any hope that the name of the person who ordered the killing will be revealed ... the people who will be tried do n't have direct contact with him , it 's a criminal group that did this for the money , " politkovsky said . two of the defendants , chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov - brothers to rustam makhmudov - are accused of having followed politkovskaya in her last weeks . the fourth defendant , sergei khadzhikurbanov , is a former police investigator from the moscow police 's organized crime unit . russia is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists to work in , with 49 killed since 1992 . the new york-based committee to protect journalists ranks the federation third deadliest for journalists after iraq and algeria . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .
but that was n't the information heilmann objected to in the online biography of him on wikipedia .
he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .

for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .
but that was n't the information heilmann objected to in the online biography of him on wikipedia .
he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .

" we want to use the last game of the year to try a few things out and to look at some new players , " loew said .
" the three new members of the squad have earned their place through their achievements . " police on alert german police say they expect around 8,000 england fans to come to berlin for the friendly , most of whom have tickets for the match at berlin 's olympic stadium .

" we will demand that the trial be open , " politkovskaya 's son ilya politkovsky told the news agency afp .
" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial . " one of the four defendants in the case , pavel ryaguzov , is a federal security service agent , meaning special attention will likely go towards keeping the minutia of the case out of public reach . ryaguzov is suspected of having provided politkovskaya 's home address to her killers and is charged with abuse of office .
three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .
she was a prominent investigative journalist in russia 's tightly controlled media landscape . her stories for bi-weekly publication novaya gazeta focused mainly on human rights abuses committed by russian troops and pro-moscow militias in conflict-torn chechnya . case politicized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya fiercely opposed the conflict in chechnya the case has received significant attention in the international media , but many fear stoppers have been placed on the investigation 's progress . " based on experience , we know that this type of case is never resolved in our country , " said boris tymoshenko of the glasnost defense foundation .
but it 's still positive that at least a part of the case has gone to court this time . " he said there was " an absence of political will " for cases of this nature . igor yakovenko , who represents the russian journalists ' association , said the russian government has not been pushing for answers to politkovskaya 's murder . " politkovskaya 's colleagues are content with the work of investigators looking into the murder .
but the officials have encountered problems and the investigation has been politicized , " he told deutsche welle . unknown killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya , politkovskaya 's son , has called for a public trial two years after her murder , both politkovskaya 's killer and the individual who are thought to have ordered it are still at large . it is believed a man named rustam makhmudov was contracted to kill the journalist and has since fled russia .
the person who ordered the killing has never been identified . " i do n't have any hope that the name of the person who ordered the killing will be revealed ... the people who will be tried do n't have direct contact with him , it 's a criminal group that did this for the money , " politkovsky said . two of the defendants , chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov - brothers to rustam makhmudov - are accused of having followed politkovskaya in her last weeks . the fourth defendant , sergei khadzhikurbanov , is a former police investigator from the moscow police 's organized crime unit . russia is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists to work in , with 49 killed since 1992 . the new york-based committee to protect journalists ranks the federation third deadliest for journalists after iraq and algeria . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the uk government had used anti-terrorist legislation to freeze the assets of collapsing icelandic banks in a bid to protect british savers ' deposits . the dutch finance ministry said last month it had reached an agreement in principle under which iceland would reimburse dutch savers for up to 20,887 euros -lrb- $ 26,490 -rrb- per person for money deposited with icesave . the netherlands said it would extend a loan of 1.3 billion euros to iceland to make this possible .
dutch authorities would then compensate depositors for anything above that amount up to 100,000 euros . but as of the end of last week , a dutch finance ministry spokeswoman said the legal documents to flesh out the memorandum of understanding had not been finalized . the weekend agreement did not make it immediately clear how the icebank deposits would be covered .
the total amount is estimated to be about 600 billion icelandic crowns -lrb- 3.5 billion euros -rrb- .
haarde said he hoped other countries would help cover the costs , and that additional funds could be raised by selling off the bank 's assets . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.11.2008 fierce clashes in dr congo despite ceasefire promises : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no end in sight to hostilities that have caused a humanitarian disaster in dr congo the congolese army and tutsi rebels have engaged in some of the worst clashes for a week despite rebel leader laurent nkunda saying he supports peace in eastern democratic republic of congo , the un said monday . there was heavy firing between nkunda 's national congress for the defence of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and the congolese army from early afternoon sunday until late evening , lieutenant colonel jean-paul dietrich , military spokesman for the un peacekeeping mission in dr congo , told german news agency dpa .
" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .

a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .

in fact , the eu 's richer nations continue to receive a far higher share of foreign immigrants from the developing world . for instance , the number of bulgarians and romanians who found a job in one of the eu 's 15 older member states grew to 1.6 million in 2007 , up from 1.3 million in 2006 - when those two countries were not yet part of the eu .
most of them have headed to spain and italy . but bulgarians and romanians still account for just 0.4 percent of the total population of the eu 's richest nations , compared to 0.3 percent in 2006 . meanwhile , citizens from poland and from the other nine countries that joined the eu in 2004 now account for 0.5 percent of the resident population of the eu 's richest nations , up from 0.3 percent in 2004 .
of the about 2 million who have left their home country , most have moved to ireland and britain . non-eu immigration up by contrast , the number of non-eu citizens now living in the eu-15 has increased from 14 million in 2003 to 17.4 million in 2007 . concerns about the invasion of " polish plumbers " - a symbol of cheap labor - are thought to have played a major role in convincing many french to vote " no " in 2005 in a referendum on the now defunct eu constitution . but commission figures show that the share of foreign residents from new eu member states has remained stable at 0.1 percent since 2003 . officials in brussels were expected to conclude on the basis of the report that enlargement has not led to major disturbances to the labor markets of the eu 's richest member states . despite this , austria and germany are still considering extending limits on the influx of workers from some of the new eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in fact , the eu 's richer nations continue to receive a far higher share of foreign immigrants from the developing world . for instance , the number of bulgarians and romanians who found a job in one of the eu 's 15 older member states grew to 1.6 million in 2007 , up from 1.3 million in 2006 - when those two countries were not yet part of the eu .
most of them have headed to spain and italy . but bulgarians and romanians still account for just 0.4 percent of the total population of the eu 's richest nations , compared to 0.3 percent in 2006 . meanwhile , citizens from poland and from the other nine countries that joined the eu in 2004 now account for 0.5 percent of the resident population of the eu 's richest nations , up from 0.3 percent in 2004 .
of the about 2 million who have left their home country , most have moved to ireland and britain . non-eu immigration up by contrast , the number of non-eu citizens now living in the eu-15 has increased from 14 million in 2003 to 17.4 million in 2007 . concerns about the invasion of " polish plumbers " - a symbol of cheap labor - are thought to have played a major role in convincing many french to vote " no " in 2005 in a referendum on the now defunct eu constitution . but commission figures show that the share of foreign residents from new eu member states has remained stable at 0.1 percent since 2003 . officials in brussels were expected to conclude on the basis of the report that enlargement has not led to major disturbances to the labor markets of the eu 's richest member states . despite this , austria and germany are still considering extending limits on the influx of workers from some of the new eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .
men however are in favour of the treaty by 48 per cent compared to 38 per cent who plan to vote " no " , with the remaining15 percent having no opinion . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .
men however are in favour of the treaty by 48 per cent compared to 38 per cent who plan to vote " no " , with the remaining15 percent having no opinion . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 17.11.2008 serbia under increasing eu pressure over mladic manhunt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has been underground since 2006 serbia 's failure to capture suspected war criminal ratko mladic is damaging its chances of joining the european union , a serbian minister said monday . belgrade 's integration into europe is intimately linked with its cooperation with the hague-based international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , which indicted mladic and his now-captured former boss radovan karadzic .
but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .

" we want to use the last game of the year to try a few things out and to look at some new players , " loew said .
" the three new members of the squad have earned their place through their achievements . " police on alert german police say they expect around 8,000 england fans to come to berlin for the friendly , most of whom have tickets for the match at berlin 's olympic stadium .

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .
" i remember the first time we played against switzerland and we played without confidence . " but now we have played and won four qualifiers for the world cup , and i can see the confidence in the players .
this is the most important thing .

" we want to use the last game of the year to try a few things out and to look at some new players , " loew said .
" the three new members of the squad have earned their place through their achievements . " police on alert german police say they expect around 8,000 england fans to come to berlin for the friendly , most of whom have tickets for the match at berlin 's olympic stadium .
still , police say around 250 known troublemakers are expected to come to germany without tickets , and they are prepared for possible trouble . bildunterschrift : the germany and england teams some 4,500 police officers are to be in the german capital on wednesday night to deal with any disturbances . " we have prepared our deployments of officers as carefully as possible for this game , because disturbances can not be excluded , " said a berlin police spokesman . german police also expect some trouble from home-grown hooligans and say they have issued warnings to about 80 individuals with a history of hooliganism . british and german police forces have exchanged information in recent months and known hooligans who come to germany will be detained at the point of entry .

but the government made no promises , and gave no cash . merkel said after meeting with leaders of adam opel gmbh that it was " not yet determined " whether the automaker would be given one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government . opel is seeking credit guarantees from berlin to counter a financial squeeze , triggered by dwindling sales and problems with its parent company general motors . taking part in the meeting at the chancellor 's office were opel chief executive hans demant , the head of gm 's european operations carl-peter forster and the head of the company 's employees ' council klaus franz . opel was expected to present details of its financial situation and explain why it needed the government to stump up an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in guarantees . merkel said that government officials planned further talks on the issue and should make a decision by christmas . industry-wide aid rejected finance minister peer steinbrueck , who also took part in the talks , earlier ruled out a general program to stimulate the country 's automobile industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , left , and glos are wary of a state aid package for opel " the state can not act as a replacement for private consumption and is not responsible for the errors of the industry , " he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper . economy minister michael glos had also voiced opposition earlier to a bail-out plan for the industry , hit by a major drop in sales due to the global economic slowdown . an opel spokesman has said the carmaker would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of gm deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary were affected . gm could get the cash ? glos , who was also at monday 's meeting , expressed concern that any financial support for opel could find its way to gm , which is facing a serious cash shortage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm , opel 's american parent , is hurting badly " we certainly have to know whether the money will remain in germany , " glos told german television .
" issues related to the american parent still need to be cleared up . " the us congress was due to meet this week do discuss a request by gm and fellow automakers ford and chrysler for billions of dollars in emergency aid to help them out of the current crisis . close to one-in-five workers are employed directly or indirectly in the german automobile sector . opel employs 25,700 workers at four factories in germany , but experts say an additional 50,000 jobs would be at stake if the company were allowed to go to the wall .
along with other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw , opel has announced temporary plant closures after a huge drop in orders . setting a precedent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short-term forecast is not great for opel the state governments of hesse , north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate , where opel manufacturing plants are located , have signalled a willingness to participate in loan guarantees . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin wanted to avoid setting a precedent .
he said the government would do all it could to help the ailing carmaker , but had to take into consideration eu regulations governing competition and subsidies . analysts said granting state aid to a single company could be viewed as discriminatory by brussels and meet with opposition .
eu competition regulators might take a dim view of any state help to opel because of it being deemed unfair to other european carmakers such as france 's renault or italy 's fiat . the german parliament last week approved a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars as part of a 12-billion-euro package designed to stimulate domestic consumption . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an economic program for the entire automobile industry makes no sense , " steinbrueck told the mass-circulation daily bild , adding that the state is " not responsible for errors committed by industrialists . " economy minister michael glos has also voiced opposition to a bail-out plan for the auto industry , which has been hit by a major drop in sales due to the global economic slowdown . request for credit guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has requested state aid to get through stormy times opel , which employs some 25,000 people across germany , said on friday it had asked berlin and regional states for credit guarantees to ensure its financing . the request follows a gm announcement that , in the wake of global market turmoil and the crisis in the us automobile sector , it would be seeking help in countries where it has major operations .

but the government made no promises , and gave no cash . merkel said after meeting with leaders of adam opel gmbh that it was " not yet determined " whether the automaker would be given one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government . opel is seeking credit guarantees from berlin to counter a financial squeeze , triggered by dwindling sales and problems with its parent company general motors . taking part in the meeting at the chancellor 's office were opel chief executive hans demant , the head of gm 's european operations carl-peter forster and the head of the company 's employees ' council klaus franz . opel was expected to present details of its financial situation and explain why it needed the government to stump up an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in guarantees . merkel said that government officials planned further talks on the issue and should make a decision by christmas . industry-wide aid rejected finance minister peer steinbrueck , who also took part in the talks , earlier ruled out a general program to stimulate the country 's automobile industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , left , and glos are wary of a state aid package for opel " the state can not act as a replacement for private consumption and is not responsible for the errors of the industry , " he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper . economy minister michael glos had also voiced opposition earlier to a bail-out plan for the industry , hit by a major drop in sales due to the global economic slowdown . an opel spokesman has said the carmaker would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of gm deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary were affected . gm could get the cash ? glos , who was also at monday 's meeting , expressed concern that any financial support for opel could find its way to gm , which is facing a serious cash shortage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm , opel 's american parent , is hurting badly " we certainly have to know whether the money will remain in germany , " glos told german television .
" issues related to the american parent still need to be cleared up . " the us congress was due to meet this week do discuss a request by gm and fellow automakers ford and chrysler for billions of dollars in emergency aid to help them out of the current crisis . close to one-in-five workers are employed directly or indirectly in the german automobile sector . opel employs 25,700 workers at four factories in germany , but experts say an additional 50,000 jobs would be at stake if the company were allowed to go to the wall .
along with other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw , opel has announced temporary plant closures after a huge drop in orders . setting a precedent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short-term forecast is not great for opel the state governments of hesse , north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate , where opel manufacturing plants are located , have signalled a willingness to participate in loan guarantees . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin wanted to avoid setting a precedent .
he said the government would do all it could to help the ailing carmaker , but had to take into consideration eu regulations governing competition and subsidies . analysts said granting state aid to a single company could be viewed as discriminatory by brussels and meet with opposition .
eu competition regulators might take a dim view of any state help to opel because of it being deemed unfair to other european carmakers such as france 's renault or italy 's fiat . the german parliament last week approved a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars as part of a 12-billion-euro package designed to stimulate domestic consumption . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .

" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .

" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action .

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .

three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .

" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial .

three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .

the deal allows for officials from the eu and china to carry out coordinated checks on producers to ensure safety standards are being met . chinese officials will also be given access to the eu 's rapid alert system for feed and food -lrb- rasff -rrb- , where authorities can exchange information about what measures are being taken to ensure food safety . the deal " substantially strengthens the systems of safety controls for product and food safety between the eu and china , " said consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva . after the agreement was signed , nancy a. nord from the us consumer product safety commission joined her counterparts from the eu and china to consider possible three-way cooperation which could include common safety standards for toys . the european commission says half of all dangerous products seized by european authorities last year came from china . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.11.2008 fierce clashes in dr congo despite ceasefire promises : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no end in sight to hostilities that have caused a humanitarian disaster in dr congo the congolese army and tutsi rebels have engaged in some of the worst clashes for a week despite rebel leader laurent nkunda saying he supports peace in eastern democratic republic of congo , the un said monday . there was heavy firing between nkunda 's national congress for the defence of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and the congolese army from early afternoon sunday until late evening , lieutenant colonel jean-paul dietrich , military spokesman for the un peacekeeping mission in dr congo , told german news agency dpa .
" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .
fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .
but there have been repeated clashes despite the ceasefire .
dietrich said all indications are that the cndp was intent on gaining more ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced people can now be found all over eastern dr congo " they are now trying to move northwards to take kanyabayonga - 175 kilometres north of goma , " he said .
" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .
rebel leader wants government talks nkunda , who has repeatedly said he would respect the ceasefire while fighting continued , has insisted on direct talks with the dr congo government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel leader laurent nkunda , center , has been dismissed as a war críminal the rebel general has warned that unless a line of communication with the government was opened , his forces - believed to number between 4,000 and 6,000 - would march on the national capital kinshasa .
but the dr congolese government has dismissed nkunda as a war criminal and refused a meeting with him .
nkunda was left out of talks in nairobi on friday , nov .
7 , attended by un secretary general ban ki-moon , dr congo 's president joseph kabila and rwanda 's president paul kagame .
fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .
however , many observers say that the ethnic dimension is merely a pretext for various militias to seize control of land rich in gold , tin and coltan , which is widely used in electronic devices . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last ten days or more they have taken more and more terrain under their control . "
a spokesman for the renegade general nkunda said government forces had been pushed back to vitshumbi , about 15 kilometers northeast of riwindi .
government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .

more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .

" yesterday we had a lot of clashes in riwindi - 125 kilometres north of goma , the capital of north kivu province - and its outskirts , " dietrich said .
the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .

for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .
but that was n't the information heilmann objected to in the online biography of him on wikipedia .
he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the government made no promises , and gave no cash . merkel said after meeting with leaders of adam opel gmbh that it was " not yet determined " whether the automaker would be given one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government . opel is seeking credit guarantees from berlin to counter a financial squeeze , triggered by dwindling sales and problems with its parent company general motors . taking part in the meeting at the chancellor 's office were opel chief executive hans demant , the head of gm 's european operations carl-peter forster and the head of the company 's employees ' council klaus franz . opel was expected to present details of its financial situation and explain why it needed the government to stump up an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in guarantees . merkel said that government officials planned further talks on the issue and should make a decision by christmas . industry-wide aid rejected finance minister peer steinbrueck , who also took part in the talks , earlier ruled out a general program to stimulate the country 's automobile industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , left , and glos are wary of a state aid package for opel " the state can not act as a replacement for private consumption and is not responsible for the errors of the industry , " he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper . economy minister michael glos had also voiced opposition earlier to a bail-out plan for the industry , hit by a major drop in sales due to the global economic slowdown . an opel spokesman has said the carmaker would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of gm deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary were affected . gm could get the cash ? glos , who was also at monday 's meeting , expressed concern that any financial support for opel could find its way to gm , which is facing a serious cash shortage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm , opel 's american parent , is hurting badly " we certainly have to know whether the money will remain in germany , " glos told german television .
" issues related to the american parent still need to be cleared up . " the us congress was due to meet this week do discuss a request by gm and fellow automakers ford and chrysler for billions of dollars in emergency aid to help them out of the current crisis . close to one-in-five workers are employed directly or indirectly in the german automobile sector . opel employs 25,700 workers at four factories in germany , but experts say an additional 50,000 jobs would be at stake if the company were allowed to go to the wall .
along with other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw , opel has announced temporary plant closures after a huge drop in orders . setting a precedent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short-term forecast is not great for opel the state governments of hesse , north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate , where opel manufacturing plants are located , have signalled a willingness to participate in loan guarantees . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin wanted to avoid setting a precedent .
he said the government would do all it could to help the ailing carmaker , but had to take into consideration eu regulations governing competition and subsidies . analysts said granting state aid to a single company could be viewed as discriminatory by brussels and meet with opposition .
eu competition regulators might take a dim view of any state help to opel because of it being deemed unfair to other european carmakers such as france 's renault or italy 's fiat . the german parliament last week approved a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars as part of a 12-billion-euro package designed to stimulate domestic consumption . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the government made no promises , and gave no cash . merkel said after meeting with leaders of adam opel gmbh that it was " not yet determined " whether the automaker would be given one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government . opel is seeking credit guarantees from berlin to counter a financial squeeze , triggered by dwindling sales and problems with its parent company general motors . taking part in the meeting at the chancellor 's office were opel chief executive hans demant , the head of gm 's european operations carl-peter forster and the head of the company 's employees ' council klaus franz . opel was expected to present details of its financial situation and explain why it needed the government to stump up an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in guarantees . merkel said that government officials planned further talks on the issue and should make a decision by christmas . industry-wide aid rejected finance minister peer steinbrueck , who also took part in the talks , earlier ruled out a general program to stimulate the country 's automobile industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , left , and glos are wary of a state aid package for opel " the state can not act as a replacement for private consumption and is not responsible for the errors of the industry , " he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper . economy minister michael glos had also voiced opposition earlier to a bail-out plan for the industry , hit by a major drop in sales due to the global economic slowdown . an opel spokesman has said the carmaker would only make use of the guarantees if the situation of gm deteriorated to the point that production and project development at its german subsidiary were affected . gm could get the cash ? glos , who was also at monday 's meeting , expressed concern that any financial support for opel could find its way to gm , which is facing a serious cash shortage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm , opel 's american parent , is hurting badly " we certainly have to know whether the money will remain in germany , " glos told german television .
" issues related to the american parent still need to be cleared up . " the us congress was due to meet this week do discuss a request by gm and fellow automakers ford and chrysler for billions of dollars in emergency aid to help them out of the current crisis . close to one-in-five workers are employed directly or indirectly in the german automobile sector . opel employs 25,700 workers at four factories in germany , but experts say an additional 50,000 jobs would be at stake if the company were allowed to go to the wall .
along with other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw , opel has announced temporary plant closures after a huge drop in orders . setting a precedent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short-term forecast is not great for opel the state governments of hesse , north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate , where opel manufacturing plants are located , have signalled a willingness to participate in loan guarantees . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin wanted to avoid setting a precedent .
he said the government would do all it could to help the ailing carmaker , but had to take into consideration eu regulations governing competition and subsidies . analysts said granting state aid to a single company could be viewed as discriminatory by brussels and meet with opposition .
eu competition regulators might take a dim view of any state help to opel because of it being deemed unfair to other european carmakers such as france 's renault or italy 's fiat . the german parliament last week approved a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars as part of a 12-billion-euro package designed to stimulate domestic consumption . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cndp seized control of the riwindi area during the fighting , which saw one indian un peacekeeper at a nearby base sustain minor injuries in crossfire .
no further exchanges of fire were reported monday morning .
the clashes took place as nkunda told un peace envoy olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria , that he would stick to a recent ceasefire and support a un-backed peace process if the government also did so .
nkunda called a ceasefire over two weeks ago as his troops were on the verge of taking goma .

government troops " have no choice but to run away across the lake or through the forest , " the spokesman said .
" we are going to advance on vitshumbi and silence the government forces .
we are going to impose a ceasefire on them . "
thousands still displaced government soldiers looted from civilians and also raped women last week as they retreated from kanyabayonga area .
aid agencies say that fighting between nkunda 's cndp and government forces has displaced at least 250,000 people since late august .
poor security has impeded access to the displaced , but a world food program convoy on friday succeeded in crossing the front lines to deliver food to tens of thousands in the towns of rutshuru and kiwanja .

fears of enlarged conflict there are fears that the fighting could reignite the 1998-2003 war which sucked in many other african nations , including angola , rwanda and zimbabwe .
more than 5 million people are estimated to have died as a result of that five-year conflict in the resource-rich nation , most of them from hunger and disease .
there have been persistent reports of angolan soldiers on the ground in the dr congo during the last few weeks of fighting , though angola has denied these reports .
southern african leaders have said they would send a peacekeeping force in to the conflict-stricken state if necessary .
some dr congo leaders have accused rwanda of backing nkunda , who says he is fighting to protect tutsis from hutu militias .
the armed hutu groups were implicated in the 1994 massacres in rwanda , when 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed .
the hutus fled to dr congo after tutsis forces led by kagame seized power .

for two days access to the popular web pages was blocked because of a preliminary injunction that barred the german site from displaying more than its start page . although the start page had to be shut down , the content of german wikipedia remained online for the duration because the servers of the free online encyclopedia are in the us and not under german jurisdiction . heilmann , 42 , a member of the far left party , die linke , is the only mp who was previously officially employed by the stasi , the former east germany 's secret police . soon after his election in 2005 , revelations and controversy surfaced about his previous career .
but that was n't the information heilmann objected to in the online biography of him on wikipedia .
he opposed claims made there that he had n't completed his university degree , and that he had been involved in a mail-order pornography business in lübeck . heilmann took offense at the " false , derisive content " which he claimed " violated his personal rights " .
he pressed charges against wikimedia deutschland , and also filed legal complaints against three online authors . mps attempts to ban site result in windfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilmann shut down the wikipedia site for two days heilmann said he would lift the injunction as soon as the offensive material was removed from the article .
on friday , nov .
14 , the site was blocked ; online users wanting to access the german wikipedia pages were greeted only by a request to donate money , part of a recent fund-raising campaign . two days later the site was once again online and heilmann apologized to wikipedia users .
a flurry of negative headlines and commentaries criticizing this latest exploit saw his popularity sink to an all-time low . in a rushed attempt to save face , heilmann issued a press release on sunday , nove .
17 , stating that he would discontinue legal action against wikimedia deutschland now that the offensive material had been removed . he indicated he would continue to pursue legal action against individual authors .
heilmann expressed his regret that wikipedia users had been affected , saying that had not been his intention . show of support massively increases revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmi wales , founder of wikipedia , was quite happy it probably was also not heilmann 's intention to inadvertently promote the online encyclopedia .
but masses of online users expressed their solidarity with the free and open resource , even reaching into their pockets . on saturday and sunday , donations soared to the tune of 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 40,734 -rrb- , compared to 2,000 – 3,000 eusors on the days previously . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .

" we want to use the last game of the year to try a few things out and to look at some new players , " loew said .
" the three new members of the squad have earned their place through their achievements . " police on alert german police say they expect around 8,000 england fans to come to berlin for the friendly , most of whom have tickets for the match at berlin 's olympic stadium .

" we have prepared our deployments of officers as carefully as possible for this game , because disturbances can not be excluded , " said a berlin police spokesman . german police also expect some trouble from home-grown hooligans and say they have issued warnings to about 80 individuals with a history of hooliganism . british and german police forces have exchanged information in recent months and known hooligans who come to germany will be detained at the point of entry .

england , under fabio capello , have won four out of four world cup qualifiers , while germany , led by joachim loew , are top of their qualifying group . time to experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's torsten frings , left , and coach joachim loew since taking over as england manager at the start of the year , capello has instilled some confidence into his side and the results and performances have been encouraging .
with a number of injuries to high-profile players , the italian has promised to use the match to experiment with a number of players . striker wayne rooney and defender rio ferdinand , both of whom missed manchester united 's victory over stoke city at the weekend , had already been ruled out , while both joe cole and ashley cole were not considered because of hamstring trouble . liverpool captain steven gerrard has been asked to report to the squad despite his club saying he would be out for seven to 10 days because of a torn muscle .
gerrard is unlikely to travel to berlin , but captain john terry , who has been struggling with a foot injury , is expected to be fit to lead the side . with wes brown , emile heskey and joe hart also out , capello will use the game to see some lesser-known players , and michael mancienne , a defender on loan at wolves from chelsea , could make an appearance . " i think the confidence of the players is different now , " capello said .
" i remember the first time we played against switzerland and we played without confidence . " but now we have played and won four qualifiers for the world cup , and i can see the confidence in the players .

" we want to use the last game of the year to try a few things out and to look at some new players , " loew said .
" the three new members of the squad have earned their place through their achievements . " police on alert german police say they expect around 8,000 england fans to come to berlin for the friendly , most of whom have tickets for the match at berlin 's olympic stadium .

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .

no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .

the uk government had used anti-terrorist legislation to freeze the assets of collapsing icelandic banks in a bid to protect british savers ' deposits . the dutch finance ministry said last month it had reached an agreement in principle under which iceland would reimburse dutch savers for up to 20,887 euros -lrb- $ 26,490 -rrb- per person for money deposited with icesave . the netherlands said it would extend a loan of 1.3 billion euros to iceland to make this possible .
dutch authorities would then compensate depositors for anything above that amount up to 100,000 euros . but as of the end of last week , a dutch finance ministry spokeswoman said the legal documents to flesh out the memorandum of understanding had not been finalized . the weekend agreement did not make it immediately clear how the icebank deposits would be covered .

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .
men however are in favour of the treaty by 48 per cent compared to 38 per cent who plan to vote " no " , with the remaining15 percent having no opinion . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .
" the only clear signal from this g20 was the acceleration of the birth of a new world order , " the italian paper said , noting that the only participants that held the financial reserves to take part in re-launching the international monetary fund were saudi arabia and china . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some editorialists praised the summit as a historic and others said it was long on rhetoric and short on specific practical solutions . the european media was divided over the results of the g20 weekend summit in washington , with some newspapers optimistic and others more skeptical about the goals set out at the gathering of leaders from the world 's largest economic powers can be achieved . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung , the success of the summit " remains an open question . "
the daily broadsheet highlighted what it characterized as a " huge transatlantic divide on how to achieve new financial structures for the 21st century . "
the paper pointed out , " on one side there was france 's nicolas sarkozy with his grandiose plans for regulating the international financial markets and on the other side - the americans , along with possibly the british , concerned about the role of new york and london as the world 's leading financial centers , who could be opposed to some necessary reforms . " the munich-based newspaper was cautious about what to expect from the summit , " much hope is invested in us president-elect barack obama , who has assembled an extraordinary team of economic advisors .
still one should not expect too much when the next world financial summit convenes at the end of april in london - roughly 100 days since obama would assume office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right nations were at the negotiating table , some papers said germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung praised the summit as a " first step on the way to a new world financial order , " adding that " important industrial and emerging economies all committed themselves to an improved global framework for reforming the financial markets .
this is no small achievement . "
the daily warned , however , against overregulation of the financial markets , saying that the global framework in place should prevent the financial markets from falling into the abyss again .
in the paper 's view , regulation should open enough not to stifle innovation and free capital flows of a market economy .
" it is critical to differentiate between absolutely essential regulation and superfluous reforms , " according to monday 's editorial . german daily die welt was optimistic , characterizing the summit as a " historic gathering of 20 of the world 's most important economies to put together a detailed road map for the new financial order . "
the daily also praised the world leaders for their " commitment to open markets and determination to renounce protectionist measures . " britain 's financial times said " the g20 summit is as historic as the crisis it responds to .
it might even prove the one bright light in the gathering darkness that this group -lrb- of leading industrial powers and emerging countries -rrb- could meet and commit itself to a substantial agenda . "
the summit and plans to meet again in april 2009 show belated recognition of the shift in the balance of economic power with economic heavyweights among developing nations , according to the paper .
" fortunately at the rhetorical level , the leaders seem to understand that they must hang together or hang separately , " the ft wrote .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate . "
the financial daily also warned that the incoming obama administration should avoid being " attracted by lures of protectionism " and stressed the need for joint action .
" the agenda is ambitious .
it can only achieve objectives if all significant countries cooperate ... the world working together can emerge healthy from this crisis .
if it does not , no government however powerful will be able to deliver on its promises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting that included developing nations shows a shifting economic world balance the french newspaper le monde said in its sunday edition that the world leaders had agreed to " declarations of principle , " leaving the hard implementation of the reforms to their finance ministers , and also emphasized the need for western nations and the emerging countries such as china and brazil to find global solutions to the collapse of the world financial markets , putting the onus on politicians to provide leadership .
" the world awaits much from this summit , " the paper commented .
" if the world 's political leaders do n't manager to deliver on their promises , one has good reason to denounce their lack of resolution . " spain 's el pais called the summit the " first necessary step , though still modest , to reforming the world financial architecture . "
the paper went on to describe the meeting as " serious and urgent , " but added that it was too short on specifics and proposed only " generic principles to reform the financial system and very general lines of economic action . " an editorial in the monday edition of the swiss daily neue züricher zeitung was scathing and characterized the outcome of the summit as " full of huge and empty words . "
it took issue with the remarks made by german chancellor angela merkel , who said " all market participants , all products and all markets ought to be stringently supervised and regulated . "
the newspaper postulated " how then ?
are there any guarantees in the future that nation-states would not collapse ?
and would financial breakdown of the state be any less catastrophic than collapse of the market failures ? " finally italy 's la repubblica 's dramatic headline called the g20 gathering a " summit of lies . " and called into question the leaders ' promise to seek coordinated growth .
" the only clear signal from this g20 was the acceleration of the birth of a new world order , " the italian paper said , noting that the only participants that held the financial reserves to take part in re-launching the international monetary fund were saudi arabia and china . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will demand that the trial be open , " politkovskaya 's son ilya politkovsky told the news agency afp .
" my mother was a journalist and i think it 's impossible to have … a closed trial . " one of the four defendants in the case , pavel ryaguzov , is a federal security service agent , meaning special attention will likely go towards keeping the minutia of the case out of public reach . ryaguzov is suspected of having provided politkovskaya 's home address to her killers and is charged with abuse of office .
three others , including a former police investigator , are also being tried for the killing . politkovskaya , who was 48 at the time of her death , was shot in the stairwell outside her moscow apartment in october 2006 in what most believe was a contract killing .
she was a prominent investigative journalist in russia 's tightly controlled media landscape . her stories for bi-weekly publication novaya gazeta focused mainly on human rights abuses committed by russian troops and pro-moscow militias in conflict-torn chechnya . case politicized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya fiercely opposed the conflict in chechnya the case has received significant attention in the international media , but many fear stoppers have been placed on the investigation 's progress . " based on experience , we know that this type of case is never resolved in our country , " said boris tymoshenko of the glasnost defense foundation .
but it 's still positive that at least a part of the case has gone to court this time . " he said there was " an absence of political will " for cases of this nature . igor yakovenko , who represents the russian journalists ' association , said the russian government has not been pushing for answers to politkovskaya 's murder . " politkovskaya 's colleagues are content with the work of investigators looking into the murder .

the deal allows for officials from the eu and china to carry out coordinated checks on producers to ensure safety standards are being met . chinese officials will also be given access to the eu 's rapid alert system for feed and food -lrb- rasff -rrb- , where authorities can exchange information about what measures are being taken to ensure food safety . the deal " substantially strengthens the systems of safety controls for product and food safety between the eu and china , " said consumer affairs commissioner meglena kuneva . after the agreement was signed , nancy a. nord from the us consumer product safety commission joined her counterparts from the eu and china to consider possible three-way cooperation which could include common safety standards for toys . the european commission says half of all dangerous products seized by european authorities last year came from china . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.11.2008 irish likely to approve lisbon treaty in new referendum : poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest weakness of the yes campaign is among women and young voters if the lisbon treaty addressed issues of special concern to the irish , such as the country 's stance on abortion , taxation and political neutrality , a new poll indicates more " yes " than " no " votes . irish voters , who had rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum last june , plunging the european union into a crisis , said they may approve a revised document , according to a tns poll conducted by the irish times .
in the poll , the public was asked how they would vote if the treaty was modified to contain opt out clauses for issues of special concern , such as ireland 's abortion laws , which are far more restrictive than most members of the 27 nation bloc and the country 's special stance on political neutrality and taxation .
the poll , which was carried out for the european commission and the irish government last week , surveyed a broad swath of voters .
it showed that if such issues were clarified in special declarations , 43 % of voters would vote in favour of the treaty and 39 % would vote against it , with the remaining respondents expressing no opinion . a representative sampling of 1,000 voters were questioned in face to face interview and is subject to a three percent margin of error .
the poll also showed a difference of views based on socio-economic class , with those well-off voting two to one in favour of the treaty and those in lower income groups voting more heavily on the " no " side .
the most substantial shift was among the rural population .
farmers are now in favour of the treaty by 46 per cent compared to only 32 per cent when the last irish times poll before the referendum was held last june .
interestingly , the big weakness of the yes campaign is among women and the youngest voters .
in the 18- to 24-year old age category , 32 percent plan to vote for the treaty , 38 percent against it and the remaining 30 percent having no opinion about it .
among women , 40 per cent intend to vote no compared with 38 per cent yes and 23 per cent in the " do n't know " category .
men however are in favour of the treaty by 48 per cent compared to 38 per cent who plan to vote " no " , with the remaining15 percent having no opinion . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of dealing with the icty , admitted his country was no closer to capturing mladic than at any point during its hunt for the former bosnian serb general .
" we do n't have any trace that leads to mladic , unless a miracle happens , " ljajic said .
" at this moment , there is nobody who can say ' mladic is in serbia , ' or ' mladic is n't in serbia ' . "
eu keen to see mladic captured a bi-annual report by icty war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz , evaluating whether serbia has been fully compliant with the tribunal in its hunt for war criminals , is due to be submitted to the un securitiy council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contents of brammertz 's report may damage serbia 's eu bid the report , based on two days of talks in belgrade with senior political and security officials , is integral to serbia 's efforts to show europe it is making progress in the hunt for mladic .
importantly , this forward motion is seen as a condition for the european union to unblock a trade and aid agreement with serbia and move the nation of around 7.5 million people closer to eu membership .
netherlands sets high bar but ljajic said eu member the netherlands has set an uphill course for belgrade 's membership aspirations .
ljajic said amsterdam had gone one step further than asking for mandatory serbian cooperation with the icty and insists only the capture and transfer of mladic would earn its approval .
" even if the report by serge brammertz about serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal is totally positive , the netherlands will block the application of the agreement , " said ljajic .
" the international community is no longer interested in our efforts , our actions , our exercises , our activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic and mladic are held responsible for the srebrenica massacre " they are interested in concrete results , because we already showed our readiness and political will " by arresting mladic 's wartime boss , radovan karadzic , in the serbian capital four months ago , he added .
no clue to mladic whereabouts mladic was believed to be hiding inside serbia until 2006 , but has since dropped off investigators ' radars .
the former bosnian serb general was indicted by the icty in 1995 for genocide and other crimes against humanity .
he personally commanded the operations in srebrenica in july 1995 , when 8,000 muslim boys and men were executed .
he moved freely in serbia after the bosnian war ended in late 1995 and went underground after slobodan milosevic 's regime fell in october 2000 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in fact , the eu 's richer nations continue to receive a far higher share of foreign immigrants from the developing world . for instance , the number of bulgarians and romanians who found a job in one of the eu 's 15 older member states grew to 1.6 million in 2007 , up from 1.3 million in 2006 - when those two countries were not yet part of the eu .
most of them have headed to spain and italy . but bulgarians and romanians still account for just 0.4 percent of the total population of the eu 's richest nations , compared to 0.3 percent in 2006 . meanwhile , citizens from poland and from the other nine countries that joined the eu in 2004 now account for 0.5 percent of the resident population of the eu 's richest nations , up from 0.3 percent in 2004 .
of the about 2 million who have left their home country , most have moved to ireland and britain . non-eu immigration up by contrast , the number of non-eu citizens now living in the eu-15 has increased from 14 million in 2003 to 17.4 million in 2007 . concerns about the invasion of " polish plumbers " - a symbol of cheap labor - are thought to have played a major role in convincing many french to vote " no " in 2005 in a referendum on the now defunct eu constitution . but commission figures show that the share of foreign residents from new eu member states has remained stable at 0.1 percent since 2003 . officials in brussels were expected to conclude on the basis of the report that enlargement has not led to major disturbances to the labor markets of the eu 's richest member states . despite this , austria and germany are still considering extending limits on the influx of workers from some of the new eu countries . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were more offences resulting in injury , although knife crime accounted for only 4 % of the most serious violent crime .
supt paul james said : " we know that our streets are not overflowing with knives , but we believe that one solitary knife in the wrong hands is one knife too many .
" we would urge anyone who owns a knife to take this opportunity to make a stand against knife crime .

mr davenport is backing the initiative after his son was stabbed an inch to the left of his heart by a 15-year-old boy as he rode his bike through cardiff city centre .
he said : " my son very nearly lost his life .
he was attacked by a group of boys and was stabbed in the chest by one of them .

many were built in the years after world war ii to provide a better standard of living for millions of people .
some estates are success stories but others are among the most deprived places in the uk .
the seacroft estate in leeds was begun in the post-war years .
it has continued to expand and around 18,000 people now live there .
part of it is judged to be within england 's 10 % most deprived locations .
over the past two months , the bbc 's nicola pearson has been spending time with people who live and work in seacroft .
these are some of their stories .

it 'll take you about two minutes to find one ; only the other day i saw two references to this scary-sounding beast .
anyone would think there were no normal , no boring , no average council estates in existence .

having grown up on a large , but fairly run-of-the-mill council estate myself , i can see that there 's a grain of truth in the cliche .
it was a self-contained world , in senses both good and bad .
on one hand , its spacious homes gave people like my grandparents a chance to live in a house with a garden , which was all they 'd ever wanted .
on the other , it was isolated , plain and cold in appearance , and stigmatised from the outset by people from the richer part of the borough , who would tell you that the place you lived in was " a den of iniquity " .
sports teams from the posher schools would be frightened of playing netball with you because they assumed you 'd want to beat them up .
its " tough " reputation preceded it and made you painfully aware of its almost segregated nature .
tough and tougher to an extent living on an estate is tough , or at least more difficult than it is to live in more affluent places .
you 're likely to have been sent there to live , rather than being able to take your pick where to live .
you 're more likely to have difficulty picking up well-paid work due to a combination of prejudice towards your postcode and your estate 's poor connections to other parts of town .
you 're more likely to go to a school that is underfunded relative to the needs of its pupils .
but just because living on an estate can be tough does n't make it a " tough council estate " .
that 's a different kettle of fish .
estates , and by extension the people who live on them , are feared and picked on because they are set apart by the way in which they were built .
from its inception at the end of the 19th century , council housing had a specific purpose - to house working-class people in conditions that gave them light and space .
estates were built far from town centres , creating a new , far-off terminus for the bus or tram and making it expensive and tiring to get to work .
you were suddenly right on the edge of town , far from the action and , as often as not , far from friends and family .
if you stuck it out and earned well , you eventually got the chance to buy your council house .
but as the economy changed , the connection between housing for working-class people and the lack of good jobs for working-class people became more solid .
these days , estates are places where you are much more likely than the rest of the population to be living in poverty .
now that , if nothing else , is tough .

if you ever want to wind me up , then show me a newspaper article that uses the phrase " tough council estate " .
it 'll take you about two minutes to find one ; only the other day i saw two references to this scary-sounding beast .
anyone would think there were no normal , no boring , no average council estates in existence .
whoever coined this phrase tapped into a deep sense - easy to hold if you 've never lived on one - that estates are strange , to-be-avoided places full of people who are not quite like the rest of us .
having grown up on a large , but fairly run-of-the-mill council estate myself , i can see that there 's a grain of truth in the cliche .
it was a self-contained world , in senses both good and bad .
on one hand , its spacious homes gave people like my grandparents a chance to live in a house with a garden , which was all they 'd ever wanted .
on the other , it was isolated , plain and cold in appearance , and stigmatised from the outset by people from the richer part of the borough , who would tell you that the place you lived in was " a den of iniquity " .
sports teams from the posher schools would be frightened of playing netball with you because they assumed you 'd want to beat them up .
its " tough " reputation preceded it and made you painfully aware of its almost segregated nature .
tough and tougher to an extent living on an estate is tough , or at least more difficult than it is to live in more affluent places .
you 're likely to have been sent there to live , rather than being able to take your pick where to live .
you 're more likely to have difficulty picking up well-paid work due to a combination of prejudice towards your postcode and your estate 's poor connections to other parts of town .
you 're more likely to go to a school that is underfunded relative to the needs of its pupils .
but just because living on an estate can be tough does n't make it a " tough council estate " .
that 's a different kettle of fish .
estates , and by extension the people who live on them , are feared and picked on because they are set apart by the way in which they were built .
from its inception at the end of the 19th century , council housing had a specific purpose - to house working-class people in conditions that gave them light and space .
estates were built far from town centres , creating a new , far-off terminus for the bus or tram and making it expensive and tiring to get to work .
you were suddenly right on the edge of town , far from the action and , as often as not , far from friends and family .
if you stuck it out and earned well , you eventually got the chance to buy your council house .
but as the economy changed , the connection between housing for working-class people and the lack of good jobs for working-class people became more solid .
these days , estates are places where you are much more likely than the rest of the population to be living in poverty .
now that , if nothing else , is tough .

rick snow , andover estate , london " i lived in rented accommodation in london before buying an ex-council house on the andover estate in north london .
everyone makes out living on a housing estate must be really bad , but it 's not .
occasionally kids scream and that , but on the whole i 've had no problems and i feel as safe as i would anywhere in london .
there are all sorts of people here - young , old , families .
there 's a really nice family upstairs and their kids play football outside , which is really sweet .
people are just living their lives and getting on with it .
where i live is n't luxurious , but the apartment is great and is a good size - much better than the places i rented .
i bought here because it was all i could afford and it was a great opportunity to get on the housing ladder .
i come home from work and it 's really quiet .
i would recommend it .
basically , the only thing that 's different between my estate and the private housing at the barbican , for example , is shed loads of money to keep the place looking better .
where i live is not really high rise ; there are trees and nice paths .
sometimes there is rubbish around , but it 's because people do n't have cars to take things to the dump , so they pile it at one end of the road for the council to take away .
ann widdecombe came here for her tv documentary and described it as being fraught with danger and people living in fear - that 's just not true . "
moanne angus , cairncry estate , aberdeen " i 've lived in the cairncry estate in aberdeen for 12 years now and have lived on council housing estates all my life .
everyone knows everyone else here .
it 's a mixture of low-rise flats and multi-story housing .
i live in one of the multi-stories with my 13 year old daughter june and my husband jack .
it 's really nice - the communal areas are carpeted , we have a caretaker , everywhere is nice and warm .
there 's no graffiti anywhere .
the only complaint my daughter has is that we ca n't have chickens !
there 's a little play area outside for toddlers and for older children there 's the community education centre with loads of activities such as an after school club and street football .
the local swimming pool is nearby and the youth club has different activities every night for various age groups .
i know about 90 % of the people who live here .
i see them on the street , at the bus stop , in the lifts .
i would notice if i had n't seen a neighbour for a while or if they were n't in the lift at the normal time each day .
i have knocked on my neighbour 's door round the corner a few times to check if she 's ok when the weather has been bad and when i was n't out much due to a bad leg , people were asking my husband if i was all right . "
andrew byrne , beeston hill , leeds " i moved up to leeds from london and bought a house on a housing estate in the beeston hill area of leeds , just bordering the bismarck estate .
i 've been here seven years now and i love it here .
i much prefer it to living in london ; the people here are friendlier and i would say there 's less trouble .
you get the odd bit of kid trouble , but it 's nothing much .
where i lived in london - fulham - is an expensive area but people were killed , i was burgled twice and my cousin was beaten up three times .
in fulham i would n't go out at night , whereas here i do n't have any problems .
i also have the best neighbours i have ever had .
on one side there 's an elderly couple and they sometimes bring me food .
on the other there 's a young couple and they 're lovely too .
when i was away from home while my dad was ill they looked after my house .
in london i was ill for a month with pneumonia and even though my neighbours knew i was ill not one of them came to see if i was ok .
no-one helped me when i moved away from london , but when i moved in here on a freezing december day people brought me hot cups of tea .
i moved to leeds for work and i was a bit worried about what it would be like to live on this estate , but i love it .
i could afford to live elsewhere , but i do n't want to move .
the vast majority of people work .
it really annoys me when people say housing estates are hotbeds of crime .
before i lived here i used to think that .
now i think it 's a great place . "

i moved to leeds for work and i was a bit worried about what it would be like to live on this estate , but i love it .
i could afford to live elsewhere , but i do n't want to move .
the vast majority of people work .
it really annoys me when people say housing estates are hotbeds of crime .
before i lived here i used to think that .
now i think it 's a great place .

rick snow , andover estate , london i lived in rented accommodation in london before buying an ex-council house on the andover estate in north london .
everyone makes out living on a housing estate must be really bad , but it 's not .
occasionally kids scream and that , but on the whole i 've had no problems and i feel as safe as i would anywhere in london .
there are all sorts of people here - young , old , families .
there 's a really nice family upstairs and their kids play football outside , which is really sweet .
people are just living their lives and getting on with it .
rick snow bought a house on the andover estate .
where i live is n't luxurious , but the apartment is great and is a good size - much better than the places i rented .
i bought here because it was all i could afford and it was a great opportunity to get on the housing ladder .
i come home from work and it 's really quiet .
i would recommend it .
basically , the only thing that 's different between my estate and the private housing at the barbican , for example , is shed loads of money to keep the place looking better .
where i live is not really high rise ; there are trees and nice paths .
sometimes there is rubbish around , but it 's because people do n't have cars to take things to the dump , so they pile it at one end of the road for the council to take away .
ann widdecombe came here for her tv documentary and described it as being fraught with danger and people living in fear - that 's just not true .
moanne angus , cairncry estate , aberdeen i 've lived in the cairncry estate in aberdeen for 12 years now and have lived on council housing estates all my life .
everyone knows everyone else here .
it 's a mixture of low-rise flats and multi-story housing .
i live in one of the multi-stories with my 13 year old daughter june and my husband jack .
it 's really nice - the communal areas are carpeted , we have a caretaker , everywhere is nice and warm .
there 's no graffiti anywhere .
the only complaint my daughter has is that we ca n't have chickens !
there 's a little play area outside for toddlers and for older children there 's the community education centre with loads of activities such as an after school club and street football .
the local swimming pool is nearby and the youth club has different activities every night for various age groups .
i know about 90 % of the people who live here .
i see them on the street , at the bus stop , in the lifts .
i would notice if i had n't seen a neighbour for a while or if they were n't in the lift at the normal time each day .
i have knocked on my neighbour 's door round the corner a few times to check if she 's ok when the weather has been bad and when i was n't out much due to a bad leg , people were asking my husband if i was all right .
andrew byrne , beeston hill , leeds i moved up to leeds from london and bought a house on a housing estate in the beeston hill area of leeds , just bordering the bismarck estate .
i 've been here seven years now and i love it here .
i much prefer it to living in london ; the people here are friendlier and i would say there 's less trouble .
you get the odd bit of kid trouble , but it 's nothing much .
where i lived in london - fulham - is an expensive area but people were killed , i was burgled twice and my cousin was beaten up three times .
in fulham i would n't go out at night , whereas here i do n't have any problems .
i also have the best neighbours i have ever had .
on one side there 's an elderly couple and they sometimes bring me food .
on the other there 's a young couple and they 're lovely too .
when i was away from home while my dad was ill they looked after my house .
in london i was ill for a month with pneumonia and even though my neighbours knew i was ill not one of them came to see if i was ok .
no-one helped me when i moved away from london , but when i moved in here on a freezing december day people brought me hot cups of tea .

rick snow , andover estate , london i lived in rented accommodation in london before buying an ex-council house on the andover estate in north london .
everyone makes out living on a housing estate must be really bad , but it 's not .
occasionally kids scream and that , but on the whole i 've had no problems and i feel as safe as i would anywhere in london .
there are all sorts of people here - young , old , families .
there 's a really nice family upstairs and their kids play football outside , which is really sweet .
people are just living their lives and getting on with it .
rick snow bought a house on the andover estate .
where i live is n't luxurious , but the apartment is great and is a good size - much better than the places i rented .
i bought here because it was all i could afford and it was a great opportunity to get on the housing ladder .
i come home from work and it 's really quiet .
i would recommend it .
basically , the only thing that 's different between my estate and the private housing at the barbican , for example , is shed loads of money to keep the place looking better .
where i live is not really high rise ; there are trees and nice paths .
sometimes there is rubbish around , but it 's because people do n't have cars to take things to the dump , so they pile it at one end of the road for the council to take away .
ann widdecombe came here for her tv documentary and described it as being fraught with danger and people living in fear - that 's just not true .
moanne angus , cairncry estate , aberdeen i 've lived in the cairncry estate in aberdeen for 12 years now and have lived on council housing estates all my life .
everyone knows everyone else here .
it 's a mixture of low-rise flats and multi-story housing .
i live in one of the multi-stories with my 13 year old daughter june and my husband jack .
it 's really nice - the communal areas are carpeted , we have a caretaker , everywhere is nice and warm .
there 's no graffiti anywhere .
the only complaint my daughter has is that we ca n't have chickens !
there 's a little play area outside for toddlers and for older children there 's the community education centre with loads of activities such as an after school club and street football .
the local swimming pool is nearby and the youth club has different activities every night for various age groups .
i know about 90 % of the people who live here .
i see them on the street , at the bus stop , in the lifts .
i would notice if i had n't seen a neighbour for a while or if they were n't in the lift at the normal time each day .
i have knocked on my neighbour 's door round the corner a few times to check if she 's ok when the weather has been bad and when i was n't out much due to a bad leg , people were asking my husband if i was all right .
andrew byrne , beeston hill , leeds i moved up to leeds from london and bought a house on a housing estate in the beeston hill area of leeds , just bordering the bismarck estate .
i 've been here seven years now and i love it here .
i much prefer it to living in london ; the people here are friendlier and i would say there 's less trouble .
you get the odd bit of kid trouble , but it 's nothing much .
where i lived in london - fulham - is an expensive area but people were killed , i was burgled twice and my cousin was beaten up three times .
in fulham i would n't go out at night , whereas here i do n't have any problems .
i also have the best neighbours i have ever had .
on one side there 's an elderly couple and they sometimes bring me food .
on the other there 's a young couple and they 're lovely too .
when i was away from home while my dad was ill they looked after my house .

rick snow , andover estate , london i lived in rented accommodation in london before buying an ex-council house on the andover estate in north london .
everyone makes out living on a housing estate must be really bad , but it 's not .
occasionally kids scream and that , but on the whole i 've had no problems and i feel as safe as i would anywhere in london .
there are all sorts of people here - young , old , families .
there 's a really nice family upstairs and their kids play football outside , which is really sweet .
people are just living their lives and getting on with it .
rick snow bought a house on the andover estate .
where i live is n't luxurious , but the apartment is great and is a good size - much better than the places i rented .
i bought here because it was all i could afford and it was a great opportunity to get on the housing ladder .
i come home from work and it 's really quiet .
i would recommend it .
basically , the only thing that 's different between my estate and the private housing at the barbican , for example , is shed loads of money to keep the place looking better .
where i live is not really high rise ; there are trees and nice paths .
sometimes there is rubbish around , but it 's because people do n't have cars to take things to the dump , so they pile it at one end of the road for the council to take away .
ann widdecombe came here for her tv documentary and described it as being fraught with danger and people living in fear - that 's just not true .
moanne angus , cairncry estate , aberdeen i 've lived in the cairncry estate in aberdeen for 12 years now and have lived on council housing estates all my life .
everyone knows everyone else here .
it 's a mixture of low-rise flats and multi-story housing .
i live in one of the multi-stories with my 13 year old daughter june and my husband jack .
it 's really nice - the communal areas are carpeted , we have a caretaker , everywhere is nice and warm .
there 's no graffiti anywhere .
the only complaint my daughter has is that we ca n't have chickens !
there 's a little play area outside for toddlers and for older children there 's the community education centre with loads of activities such as an after school club and street football .
the local swimming pool is nearby and the youth club has different activities every night for various age groups .
i know about 90 % of the people who live here .
i see them on the street , at the bus stop , in the lifts .
i would notice if i had n't seen a neighbour for a while or if they were n't in the lift at the normal time each day .
i have knocked on my neighbour 's door round the corner a few times to check if she 's ok when the weather has been bad and when i was n't out much due to a bad leg , people were asking my husband if i was all right .
andrew byrne , beeston hill , leeds i moved up to leeds from london and bought a house on a housing estate in the beeston hill area of leeds , just bordering the bismarck estate .
i 've been here seven years now and i love it here .
i much prefer it to living in london ; the people here are friendlier and i would say there 's less trouble .
you get the odd bit of kid trouble , but it 's nothing much .
where i lived in london - fulham - is an expensive area but people were killed , i was burgled twice and my cousin was beaten up three times .
in fulham i would n't go out at night , whereas here i do n't have any problems .
i also have the best neighbours i have ever had .
on one side there 's an elderly couple and they sometimes bring me food .
on the other there 's a young couple and they 're lovely too .
