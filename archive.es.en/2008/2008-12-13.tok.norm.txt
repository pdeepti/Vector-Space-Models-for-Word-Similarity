a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .

because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "
the lbb is still legally responsible for the consequences , he said .

customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "
the lbb is still legally responsible for the consequences , he said .

the european union admits that billions are needed for the task , but early-morning talks on starting the process during the dec .
1-12 conference in poznan , poland , led nowhere .
india angrily accused rich nations of " callousness , strategizing and obfuscation , " noting that victims of climate change are often the poorest of the poor .
" we 're going to have to put much more energy into bridging the growing gap between the two sides , " ghana 's envoy told the meeting .
" it 's the vision gap and that is not a good sign for the future . "
waiting for obama the two-week talks brought little progress on the most contentious issues - notably , cuts in emissions blamed for global warming - partly because other countries are waiting for barack obama to take over as us president on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate victims often suffer from poverty as well the 189-nation meeting was part of efforts to bring about a deal next december for rich and poor countries to cut output of heat-trapping gases , mainly carbon dioxide emitted when fossil fuels burn .
but the emotional language at the wrap-up session underlined the challenge of stepping up the fight against global warming during an economic slump , a theme many speakers raised throughout the meeting .
delegates late friday passed a work plan that confirms the 2009 target date and outlines the path for intense negotiations to be held in copenhagen next december .
" from now on , it 's for real , " said yvo de boer , the top un climate official .
climate fund agreed industrialized countries broke the deadlock on the long-dormant climate impact fund by agreeing that poor nations can draw money directly , not go through an international aid bureaucracy .
the fund finances projects such as sea walls and reversing desertification .
with developing nations under pressure to agree to emissions cuts , the aid deal could help bring about a grand bargain on fighting climate change next year .
" it is a very big achievement , " polish environment minister maciej nowicki said .
" this will lay the necessary groundwork for an ambitious outcome in copenhagen . "
at issue is finding a global treaty to replace the kyoto protocol , which binds rich countries to cuts and expires in 2012 .
environmental groups focused on the lack of big-money pledges . " we urgently needed a decision on increased future funding ... but we did n't get there , " said barry coates of oxfam , the international charity .
eu leaders say europe far ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore has been an outspoken advocate of climate action also friday , european union leaders in brussels removed an obstacle by agreeing on how each member country should contribute to clean-air targets .
the eu-wide goal is to cut emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
while environmentalists said the accord goes too easy on polluting industries and coal-using utilities , eu leaders said it was evidence that the 27-nation bloc leads the world in tackling climate change .
former us vice president al gore fired up un delegates with an impassioned plea for a global warming accord , saying human survival may be at risk unless rich and poor countries bridge their gaps .
gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize for drawing attention to climate change , drew two standing ovations and cheers by delegates .
applause rippled through the conference room when he evoked obama 's pledges to move beyond president george w. bush 's climate policy and engage washington " vigorously " in un negotiations . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu leaders unite on climate plan and lisbon treaty european union leaders have approved a set of laws on fighting climate change , a plan for rescuing the economy from recession and a way out of the impasse caused by ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty .

a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .
13 .
because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "

a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .

because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "

a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .
13 .
because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "
the lbb is still legally responsible for the consequences , he said .
the lbb case is the latest in a series of privacy scandals that have recently hit germany , including several at deutsche telekom , the country 's telecommunications giant . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .

the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .

khedira had given stuttgart the lead on the stroke of halftime and got the equalizer after munich had massimo oddo sent off late in the match . munich have 35 points for a one-point advantage over surprise package tsg hoffenheim , who need a draw on sunday against schalke to go into the six-week winter break at the top of the standings on goal difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira shot flew past munich goalkeeper michael rensing hertha berlin and sv hamburg have 33 apiece and bayer leverkusen 32 .

borowski slotted home in the 48th after former germany goalkeeper jens lehmann parried bastian schweinsteiger 's shot , and then fed toni on the counter in the 66th minute , the italy forward tapping in from close range . oddo was sent off five minutes from time for a ruthless tackle , and khedira scored again late for the final draw with a spectacular volley from the edge of the area . " it 's a pity to get the equalizer in the last minute .
the red card was crucial , " said klinsmann . stuttgart captain thomas hitzlsperger said : " we did n't give up , even against a team like bayern . " babbel called his team " sensational " saying , " we threw away a lead but fought hard to get the draw .

surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the budget shrinks , companies look for used machinery it 's not the first time outsourcing has boosted the private sector .
the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
statistically however , the security industry 's growth rate has exceeded overall economic development .
" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and future eu members drive the second-hand market nagel said he sees a similar trend developing in central asia .
" countries undergoing rapid economic growth often come looking for cheap high-quality machinery and equipment to keep pace with rising production . "
official estimates suggest that the used goods industry generates around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 131 billion -rrb- a year worldwide .
and this sector shows no signs of slowing , not at least while the credit crunch lasts .
florian hess , a trade fair organizer form karlsruhe , is still doing a tidy business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.12.2008 some german sectors profit despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession does n't necessarily mean economic loss for everyone in the face of the global financial crisis world economies are in freefall .
surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the budget shrinks , companies look for used machinery it 's not the first time outsourcing has boosted the private sector .
the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
statistically however , the security industry 's growth rate has exceeded overall economic development .
" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and future eu members drive the second-hand market nagel said he sees a similar trend developing in central asia .
" countries undergoing rapid economic growth often come looking for cheap high-quality machinery and equipment to keep pace with rising production . "
official estimates suggest that the used goods industry generates around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 131 billion -rrb- a year worldwide .
and this sector shows no signs of slowing , not at least while the credit crunch lasts .

the diplomatic upgrading paves the way for an eu-israel summit likely to be held next year and tri-yearly meetings between eu and israeli foreign ministers .
" it is the first time a prime minister of israel will formally meet european heads of state , " rafael barak , deputy director-general of the european department at the israeli foreign ministry , told dw-world .
" we have had meetings with mr. sarkozy , ms. merkel and mr. brown , but formally with the eu we 've never had an official meeting " he said .
" so the fact that now we have this framework to have this kind of summit will give the necessary advantage of high-level relations . "
but french foreign minister bernard kouchner said that " no political significance " should be attached to the decision to boost relations with israel .
" we also said ... that the ' deepening ' of relations with palestine would follow , " he told reporters .
it is " a little more difficult with the palestinians , because there is no state , so it will be more complicated . "
the palestinian authority has stood firmly against firmer eu-israel relations , insisting israel has not done enough to ease the humanitarian crisis in palestinian-inhabited areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for israel 's destruction common interests barak said israel would use the improved relations to work more closely with the eu on the question of iran , the palestinian conflict and israel 's northern border , which is shared with syria and lebanon .
" the three main aspects of our political agenda match with what is important for europe and stability in europe , " he said .
" these elements are part of our daily dialogue with the eu .
it 's not an easy task ... and the situation on the ground is not always an easy one .
but i think that being aware of the situation is important as is trying to solve all of this with a final status agreement -lrb- for palestine -rrb- .
" we know that membership of the eu is not in our cards so we are trying to improve our position with the eu . "
egypt quartet meeting but a long-elusive peace accord between israel and the palestinians looks no closer to realization , with the quartet on the middle east - the us , russia , the eu and un - which is involved in mediating the peace process , foreseeing at a meeting in sharm el-sheikh , egypt , on dec .
7 , that no major breakthroughs were likely in the immediate future .
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni stressed sunday that she would not sign " any agreement that does not serve israel 's interest and that is not detailed enough to be put into effect .
we are not there yet and it could take time . "
last november in the us city of annapolis , israeli and palestinian officials attempted to revive talks over solving key problems such as the status of jerusalem and the borders of a future palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said peace must serve israel 's interests barak , the deputy director-general , said that the presence of palestinian president mahmud abbas and livni at the egypt meeting sent a " strong message " that peace efforts were continuing .
" yes , the goal is a two-state solution .
we need more time , but we 're making progress .
yes , we would like to keep these conversations discreet .
yes , we ask the world , in particular the arab world , not to sit on the fence and try to offer support to the palestinians , " he said .

however , the contingent is n't specifically foreseen for dr congo . the rapid reaction force should , in the coming years , be able to conduct " simultaneously , outside its territory , a series of civilian missions and military operations of varying scope , " heads of state and government said in a joint statement issued at the end of two days of talks in brussels on friday , dec .
12 . providing fresh impetus to a common eu defense policy had been a pet project of french president nicolas sarkozy , whose six-month term as chairman of the bloc 's meetings expires at the end of the year . in their joint statement , eu leaders acknowledged the need to strengthen and optimize europe 's defense capabilities and vowed to work more closely with nato . friday 's statement said the bloc aims , with the implementation of a rapid reaction force , to be able to conduct up to 20 missions simultaneously . the eu is currently engaged in a number of peacekeeping or civilian operations around the world , including kosovo , afghanistan , georgia and chad .
it has just launched its first anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia , consisting of up to six warships and three surveillance aircraft . torn between eu and nato eu leaders , however , have been unable to agree on a peacekeeping mission to the democratic republic of congo , despite repeated requests from un secretary-general ban ki-moon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 250,000 people have been displaced by the violence the un currently has a 17,000-strong peacekeeping mission in dr congo , mainly with troops from african countries .
the mission has not been able to contain increasing violence between rebel laurent nkunda and pro-government militias . an estimated 250,000 people have been displaced from their homes in recent weeks . the issue of eu involvement has highlighted the problem of getting the bloc 's 27 member states to mobilize forces for eu missions while at the same time being asked to boost their contributions to nato operations around the world . the eu already has two battle groups consisting of 1,500 men each , one led by britain , the other by germany .
political obstacles have so far prevented their deployment . eu divided on role in dr congo critics say that the creation of a larger 60,000-strong force is an overly-ambitious target for the eu .
nato - which has 28 member states , one more than the eu - has spent nearly a decade trying to get its own member states to contribute to a rapid reaction force of just 25,000 soldiers . troop contributions to an eu force would be made on a voluntary basis . though he has championed a common eu defense force , sarkozy questioned the need for a dr congo mission . " is n't it better to draw on regional forces , who are ready to go , rather than european forces ? " he said . but belgium 's foreign minister karel de gucht said the bloc had " a moral responsibility " to intervene .

the european union admits that billions are needed for the task , but early-morning talks on starting the process during the dec .
1-12 conference in poznan , poland , led nowhere .
india angrily accused rich nations of " callousness , strategizing and obfuscation , " noting that victims of climate change are often the poorest of the poor .
" we 're going to have to put much more energy into bridging the growing gap between the two sides , " ghana 's envoy told the meeting .
" it 's the vision gap and that is not a good sign for the future . "
waiting for obama the two-week talks brought little progress on the most contentious issues - notably , cuts in emissions blamed for global warming - partly because other countries are waiting for barack obama to take over as us president on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate victims often suffer from poverty as well the 189-nation meeting was part of efforts to bring about a deal next december for rich and poor countries to cut output of heat-trapping gases , mainly carbon dioxide emitted when fossil fuels burn .
but the emotional language at the wrap-up session underlined the challenge of stepping up the fight against global warming during an economic slump , a theme many speakers raised throughout the meeting .
delegates late friday passed a work plan that confirms the 2009 target date and outlines the path for intense negotiations to be held in copenhagen next december .
" from now on , it 's for real , " said yvo de boer , the top un climate official .
climate fund agreed industrialized countries broke the deadlock on the long-dormant climate impact fund by agreeing that poor nations can draw money directly , not go through an international aid bureaucracy .
the fund finances projects such as sea walls and reversing desertification .
with developing nations under pressure to agree to emissions cuts , the aid deal could help bring about a grand bargain on fighting climate change next year .
" it is a very big achievement , " polish environment minister maciej nowicki said .
" this will lay the necessary groundwork for an ambitious outcome in copenhagen . "
at issue is finding a global treaty to replace the kyoto protocol , which binds rich countries to cuts and expires in 2012 .
environmental groups focused on the lack of big-money pledges . " we urgently needed a decision on increased future funding ... but we did n't get there , " said barry coates of oxfam , the international charity .
eu leaders say europe far ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore has been an outspoken advocate of climate action also friday , european union leaders in brussels removed an obstacle by agreeing on how each member country should contribute to clean-air targets .
the eu-wide goal is to cut emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
while environmentalists said the accord goes too easy on polluting industries and coal-using utilities , eu leaders said it was evidence that the 27-nation bloc leads the world in tackling climate change .
former us vice president al gore fired up un delegates with an impassioned plea for a global warming accord , saying human survival may be at risk unless rich and poor countries bridge their gaps .
gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize for drawing attention to climate change , drew two standing ovations and cheers by delegates .
applause rippled through the conference room when he evoked obama 's pledges to move beyond president george w. bush 's climate policy and engage washington " vigorously " in un negotiations . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .
13 .
because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "
the lbb is still legally responsible for the consequences , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.12.2008 some german sectors profit despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession does n't necessarily mean economic loss for everyone in the face of the global financial crisis world economies are in freefall .
surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the budget shrinks , companies look for used machinery it 's not the first time outsourcing has boosted the private sector .
the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
statistically however , the security industry 's growth rate has exceeded overall economic development .
" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and future eu members drive the second-hand market nagel said he sees a similar trend developing in central asia .
" countries undergoing rapid economic growth often come looking for cheap high-quality machinery and equipment to keep pace with rising production . "
official estimates suggest that the used goods industry generates around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 131 billion -rrb- a year worldwide .
and this sector shows no signs of slowing , not at least while the credit crunch lasts .
florian hess , a trade fair organizer form karlsruhe , is still doing a tidy business .
he organizes the annual resale fair and is fairly certain that next year 's figures will put him ten percent up in profit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.12.2008 some german sectors profit despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession does n't necessarily mean economic loss for everyone in the face of the global financial crisis world economies are in freefall .
surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the budget shrinks , companies look for used machinery it 's not the first time outsourcing has boosted the private sector .
the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
statistically however , the security industry 's growth rate has exceeded overall economic development .
" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and future eu members drive the second-hand market nagel said he sees a similar trend developing in central asia .
" countries undergoing rapid economic growth often come looking for cheap high-quality machinery and equipment to keep pace with rising production . "
official estimates suggest that the used goods industry generates around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 131 billion -rrb- a year worldwide .
and this sector shows no signs of slowing , not at least while the credit crunch lasts .
florian hess , a trade fair organizer form karlsruhe , is still doing a tidy business .
he organizes the annual resale fair and is fairly certain that next year 's figures will put him ten percent up in profit .
" it 's a second-hand merchant 's market , " he said . klaus ulrich -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

however , the contingent is n't specifically foreseen for dr congo . the rapid reaction force should , in the coming years , be able to conduct " simultaneously , outside its territory , a series of civilian missions and military operations of varying scope , " heads of state and government said in a joint statement issued at the end of two days of talks in brussels on friday , dec .
12 . providing fresh impetus to a common eu defense policy had been a pet project of french president nicolas sarkozy , whose six-month term as chairman of the bloc 's meetings expires at the end of the year . in their joint statement , eu leaders acknowledged the need to strengthen and optimize europe 's defense capabilities and vowed to work more closely with nato . friday 's statement said the bloc aims , with the implementation of a rapid reaction force , to be able to conduct up to 20 missions simultaneously . the eu is currently engaged in a number of peacekeeping or civilian operations around the world , including kosovo , afghanistan , georgia and chad .
it has just launched its first anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia , consisting of up to six warships and three surveillance aircraft . torn between eu and nato eu leaders , however , have been unable to agree on a peacekeeping mission to the democratic republic of congo , despite repeated requests from un secretary-general ban ki-moon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 250,000 people have been displaced by the violence the un currently has a 17,000-strong peacekeeping mission in dr congo , mainly with troops from african countries .
the mission has not been able to contain increasing violence between rebel laurent nkunda and pro-government militias . an estimated 250,000 people have been displaced from their homes in recent weeks . the issue of eu involvement has highlighted the problem of getting the bloc 's 27 member states to mobilize forces for eu missions while at the same time being asked to boost their contributions to nato operations around the world . the eu already has two battle groups consisting of 1,500 men each , one led by britain , the other by germany .
political obstacles have so far prevented their deployment . eu divided on role in dr congo critics say that the creation of a larger 60,000-strong force is an overly-ambitious target for the eu .
nato - which has 28 member states , one more than the eu - has spent nearly a decade trying to get its own member states to contribute to a rapid reaction force of just 25,000 soldiers . troop contributions to an eu force would be made on a voluntary basis . though he has championed a common eu defense force , sarkozy questioned the need for a dr congo mission . " is n't it better to draw on regional forces , who are ready to go , rather than european forces ? " he said . but belgium 's foreign minister karel de gucht said the bloc had " a moral responsibility " to intervene .
belgium was formerly a colonial power in dr congo . britain has continually favored contributing to the existing un force rather than sending a separate eu mission . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

borowski slotted home in the 48th after former germany goalkeeper jens lehmann parried bastian schweinsteiger 's shot , and then fed toni on the counter in the 66th minute , the italy forward tapping in from close range . oddo was sent off five minutes from time for a ruthless tackle , and khedira scored again late for the final draw with a spectacular volley from the edge of the area . " it 's a pity to get the equalizer in the last minute .
the red card was crucial , " said klinsmann . stuttgart captain thomas hitzlsperger said : " we did n't give up , even against a team like bayern . " babbel called his team " sensational " saying , " we threw away a lead but fought hard to get the draw . " the rest of the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's players had ample opportunity to celebrate in saturday 's other bundesliga action , hertha berlin won 4-0 over sc karlsruhe from maximilian nicu 's eighth-minute half-volley and three goals in the final 20 minutes from valeri domovchiyski , fabian lustenberger and raffael . hamburg remained tied on points with hertha with their seventh win in eight home games , with reliable croatian marksman mladen petric scoring the 1-0 winner over eintracht frankfurt with a diving header off piotr trochowski 's right-wing cross . leverkusen 's germany midfielder simon rolfes found an opening in the 77th minute but visiting energie cottbus salvaged a surprise 1-1 in the final minute from china 's shao jiayi . midtable werder bremen came from behind to beat vfl wolfsburg 2-1 , cologne won 2-1 at vfl bochum while hanover 96 and arminia bielefeld drew 1-1 .

a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .
13 .
because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "
the lbb is still legally responsible for the consequences , he said .

khedira had given stuttgart the lead on the stroke of halftime and got the equalizer after munich had massimo oddo sent off late in the match . munich have 35 points for a one-point advantage over surprise package tsg hoffenheim , who need a draw on sunday against schalke to go into the six-week winter break at the top of the standings on goal difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira shot flew past munich goalkeeper michael rensing hertha berlin and sv hamburg have 33 apiece and bayer leverkusen 32 .

but we would have preferred a win today . " beginners luck for babbel ? the 2007 champions stuttgart won their last two matches since coaching novice markus babbel took over , and he managed a lucky draw against the club he formerly played for , with munich missing french star franck ribery over a shoulder injury . the hosts grabbed the lead in first-half injury time when martin delpierre nodded on jan simak 's corner to the unmarked khedira , whose diving header found its way past michael rensing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was caught out on toni 's goal for bayern but munich rebounded after the break .

" it 's a pity to get the equalizer in the last minute .
the red card was crucial , " said klinsmann . stuttgart captain thomas hitzlsperger said : " we did n't give up , even against a team like bayern . " babbel called his team " sensational " saying , " we threw away a lead but fought hard to get the draw . " the rest of the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's players had ample opportunity to celebrate in saturday 's other bundesliga action , hertha berlin won 4-0 over sc karlsruhe from maximilian nicu 's eighth-minute half-volley and three goals in the final 20 minutes from valeri domovchiyski , fabian lustenberger and raffael . hamburg remained tied on points with hertha with their seventh win in eight home games , with reliable croatian marksman mladen petric scoring the 1-0 winner over eintracht frankfurt with a diving header off piotr trochowski 's right-wing cross . leverkusen 's germany midfielder simon rolfes found an opening in the 77th minute but visiting energie cottbus salvaged a surprise 1-1 in the final minute from china 's shao jiayi . midtable werder bremen came from behind to beat vfl wolfsburg 2-1 , cologne won 2-1 at vfl bochum while hanover 96 and arminia bielefeld drew 1-1 .

khedira had given stuttgart the lead on the stroke of halftime and got the equalizer after munich had massimo oddo sent off late in the match . munich have 35 points for a one-point advantage over surprise package tsg hoffenheim , who need a draw on sunday against schalke to go into the six-week winter break at the top of the standings on goal difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira shot flew past munich goalkeeper michael rensing hertha berlin and sv hamburg have 33 apiece and bayer leverkusen 32 . " the team has been first class over the past three months , " munich coach juergen klinsmann said after the game .
" we are very satisfied overall . " borowski said : " we stuttered a bit at the start of the season but then got going .
but we would have preferred a win today . " beginners luck for babbel ? the 2007 champions stuttgart won their last two matches since coaching novice markus babbel took over , and he managed a lucky draw against the club he formerly played for , with munich missing french star franck ribery over a shoulder injury . the hosts grabbed the lead in first-half injury time when martin delpierre nodded on jan simak 's corner to the unmarked khedira , whose diving header found its way past michael rensing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was caught out on toni 's goal for bayern but munich rebounded after the break .
borowski slotted home in the 48th after former germany goalkeeper jens lehmann parried bastian schweinsteiger 's shot , and then fed toni on the counter in the 66th minute , the italy forward tapping in from close range . oddo was sent off five minutes from time for a ruthless tackle , and khedira scored again late for the final draw with a spectacular volley from the edge of the area . " it 's a pity to get the equalizer in the last minute .
the red card was crucial , " said klinsmann . stuttgart captain thomas hitzlsperger said : " we did n't give up , even against a team like bayern . " babbel called his team " sensational " saying , " we threw away a lead but fought hard to get the draw . " the rest of the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's players had ample opportunity to celebrate in saturday 's other bundesliga action , hertha berlin won 4-0 over sc karlsruhe from maximilian nicu 's eighth-minute half-volley and three goals in the final 20 minutes from valeri domovchiyski , fabian lustenberger and raffael . hamburg remained tied on points with hertha with their seventh win in eight home games , with reliable croatian marksman mladen petric scoring the 1-0 winner over eintracht frankfurt with a diving header off piotr trochowski 's right-wing cross . leverkusen 's germany midfielder simon rolfes found an opening in the 77th minute but visiting energie cottbus salvaged a surprise 1-1 in the final minute from china 's shao jiayi . midtable werder bremen came from behind to beat vfl wolfsburg 2-1 , cologne won 2-1 at vfl bochum while hanover 96 and arminia bielefeld drew 1-1 .

but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .

the european union admits that billions are needed for the task , but early-morning talks on starting the process during the dec .
1-12 conference in poznan , poland , led nowhere .
india angrily accused rich nations of " callousness , strategizing and obfuscation , " noting that victims of climate change are often the poorest of the poor .
" we 're going to have to put much more energy into bridging the growing gap between the two sides , " ghana 's envoy told the meeting .
" it 's the vision gap and that is not a good sign for the future . "
waiting for obama the two-week talks brought little progress on the most contentious issues - notably , cuts in emissions blamed for global warming - partly because other countries are waiting for barack obama to take over as us president on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate victims often suffer from poverty as well the 189-nation meeting was part of efforts to bring about a deal next december for rich and poor countries to cut output of heat-trapping gases , mainly carbon dioxide emitted when fossil fuels burn .
but the emotional language at the wrap-up session underlined the challenge of stepping up the fight against global warming during an economic slump , a theme many speakers raised throughout the meeting .
delegates late friday passed a work plan that confirms the 2009 target date and outlines the path for intense negotiations to be held in copenhagen next december .
" from now on , it 's for real , " said yvo de boer , the top un climate official .
climate fund agreed industrialized countries broke the deadlock on the long-dormant climate impact fund by agreeing that poor nations can draw money directly , not go through an international aid bureaucracy .
the fund finances projects such as sea walls and reversing desertification .
with developing nations under pressure to agree to emissions cuts , the aid deal could help bring about a grand bargain on fighting climate change next year .
" it is a very big achievement , " polish environment minister maciej nowicki said .
" this will lay the necessary groundwork for an ambitious outcome in copenhagen . "
at issue is finding a global treaty to replace the kyoto protocol , which binds rich countries to cuts and expires in 2012 .
environmental groups focused on the lack of big-money pledges . " we urgently needed a decision on increased future funding ... but we did n't get there , " said barry coates of oxfam , the international charity .
eu leaders say europe far ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gore has been an outspoken advocate of climate action also friday , european union leaders in brussels removed an obstacle by agreeing on how each member country should contribute to clean-air targets .
the eu-wide goal is to cut emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
while environmentalists said the accord goes too easy on polluting industries and coal-using utilities , eu leaders said it was evidence that the 27-nation bloc leads the world in tackling climate change .
former us vice president al gore fired up un delegates with an impassioned plea for a global warming accord , saying human survival may be at risk unless rich and poor countries bridge their gaps .
gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize for drawing attention to climate change , drew two standing ovations and cheers by delegates .
applause rippled through the conference room when he evoked obama 's pledges to move beyond president george w. bush 's climate policy and engage washington " vigorously " in un negotiations . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin bank has reportedly lost data on thousands of credit card customers - including their pin numbers . strictly confidential information on over 10,000 credit card customers of the landesbank berlin -lrb- lbb -rrb- was anonymously sent to the frankfurter rundschau , the newspaper claimed on saturday , dec .

because the lbb is the country 's largest creditor , said the paper , many customers of other banks are also affected by the data breach .
customers ' names , addresses , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , transaction information and - in some cases - pin numbers were included on the micro-fiches the frankfurter rundschau had received .
the case " overshadows all previous cases in size and especially in the quality of data , " thilo weichert , director of the independent center for privacy protection in schleswig-holstein , told the berliner zeitung .
he said the lbb mishap was an " unbelievable and unique case . "
" the credit card accounts can be maxed out to their credit limit , " added weichert .
supposedly , the data leak originated with another company , atosworldline , which lbb had hired to do its accounting .
weichert criticized lbb 's practice of passing sensitive data on to third parties , calling it an " achilles ' heal and enormous loss of control . "
the lbb is still legally responsible for the consequences , he said .

surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .

the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .

" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .

" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

the diplomatic upgrading paves the way for an eu-israel summit likely to be held next year and tri-yearly meetings between eu and israeli foreign ministers .
" it is the first time a prime minister of israel will formally meet european heads of state , " rafael barak , deputy director-general of the european department at the israeli foreign ministry , told dw-world .
" we have had meetings with mr. sarkozy , ms. merkel and mr. brown , but formally with the eu we 've never had an official meeting " he said .
" so the fact that now we have this framework to have this kind of summit will give the necessary advantage of high-level relations . "
but french foreign minister bernard kouchner said that " no political significance " should be attached to the decision to boost relations with israel .
" we also said ... that the ' deepening ' of relations with palestine would follow , " he told reporters .
it is " a little more difficult with the palestinians , because there is no state , so it will be more complicated . "
the palestinian authority has stood firmly against firmer eu-israel relations , insisting israel has not done enough to ease the humanitarian crisis in palestinian-inhabited areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for israel 's destruction common interests barak said israel would use the improved relations to work more closely with the eu on the question of iran , the palestinian conflict and israel 's northern border , which is shared with syria and lebanon .
" the three main aspects of our political agenda match with what is important for europe and stability in europe , " he said .
" these elements are part of our daily dialogue with the eu .
it 's not an easy task ... and the situation on the ground is not always an easy one .
but i think that being aware of the situation is important as is trying to solve all of this with a final status agreement -lrb- for palestine -rrb- .
" we know that membership of the eu is not in our cards so we are trying to improve our position with the eu . "
egypt quartet meeting but a long-elusive peace accord between israel and the palestinians looks no closer to realization , with the quartet on the middle east - the us , russia , the eu and un - which is involved in mediating the peace process , foreseeing at a meeting in sharm el-sheikh , egypt , on dec .
7 , that no major breakthroughs were likely in the immediate future .
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni stressed sunday that she would not sign " any agreement that does not serve israel 's interest and that is not detailed enough to be put into effect .
we are not there yet and it could take time . "
last november in the us city of annapolis , israeli and palestinian officials attempted to revive talks over solving key problems such as the status of jerusalem and the borders of a future palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said peace must serve israel 's interests barak , the deputy director-general , said that the presence of palestinian president mahmud abbas and livni at the egypt meeting sent a " strong message " that peace efforts were continuing .
" yes , the goal is a two-state solution .
we need more time , but we 're making progress .
yes , we would like to keep these conversations discreet .
yes , we ask the world , in particular the arab world , not to sit on the fence and try to offer support to the palestinians , " he said .

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.12.2008 some german sectors profit despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession does n't necessarily mean economic loss for everyone in the face of the global financial crisis world economies are in freefall .
surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the budget shrinks , companies look for used machinery it 's not the first time outsourcing has boosted the private sector .
the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
statistically however , the security industry 's growth rate has exceeded overall economic development .
" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and future eu members drive the second-hand market nagel said he sees a similar trend developing in central asia .
" countries undergoing rapid economic growth often come looking for cheap high-quality machinery and equipment to keep pace with rising production . "
official estimates suggest that the used goods industry generates around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 131 billion -rrb- a year worldwide .
and this sector shows no signs of slowing , not at least while the credit crunch lasts .
florian hess , a trade fair organizer form karlsruhe , is still doing a tidy business .
he organizes the annual resale fair and is fairly certain that next year 's figures will put him ten percent up in profit .
" it 's a second-hand merchant 's market , " he said . klaus ulrich -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the contingent is n't specifically foreseen for dr congo . the rapid reaction force should , in the coming years , be able to conduct " simultaneously , outside its territory , a series of civilian missions and military operations of varying scope , " heads of state and government said in a joint statement issued at the end of two days of talks in brussels on friday , dec .
12 . providing fresh impetus to a common eu defense policy had been a pet project of french president nicolas sarkozy , whose six-month term as chairman of the bloc 's meetings expires at the end of the year . in their joint statement , eu leaders acknowledged the need to strengthen and optimize europe 's defense capabilities and vowed to work more closely with nato . friday 's statement said the bloc aims , with the implementation of a rapid reaction force , to be able to conduct up to 20 missions simultaneously . the eu is currently engaged in a number of peacekeeping or civilian operations around the world , including kosovo , afghanistan , georgia and chad .
it has just launched its first anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia , consisting of up to six warships and three surveillance aircraft . torn between eu and nato eu leaders , however , have been unable to agree on a peacekeeping mission to the democratic republic of congo , despite repeated requests from un secretary-general ban ki-moon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 250,000 people have been displaced by the violence the un currently has a 17,000-strong peacekeeping mission in dr congo , mainly with troops from african countries .
the mission has not been able to contain increasing violence between rebel laurent nkunda and pro-government militias . an estimated 250,000 people have been displaced from their homes in recent weeks . the issue of eu involvement has highlighted the problem of getting the bloc 's 27 member states to mobilize forces for eu missions while at the same time being asked to boost their contributions to nato operations around the world . the eu already has two battle groups consisting of 1,500 men each , one led by britain , the other by germany .
political obstacles have so far prevented their deployment . eu divided on role in dr congo critics say that the creation of a larger 60,000-strong force is an overly-ambitious target for the eu .
nato - which has 28 member states , one more than the eu - has spent nearly a decade trying to get its own member states to contribute to a rapid reaction force of just 25,000 soldiers . troop contributions to an eu force would be made on a voluntary basis . though he has championed a common eu defense force , sarkozy questioned the need for a dr congo mission . " is n't it better to draw on regional forces , who are ready to go , rather than european forces ? " he said . but belgium 's foreign minister karel de gucht said the bloc had " a moral responsibility " to intervene .
belgium was formerly a colonial power in dr congo . britain has continually favored contributing to the existing un force rather than sending a separate eu mission . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . representatives of various social groups would work together in the new democratic movement , ekho moskvy radio reported . the traditionally splintered russian opposition has been trying to unite against what it sees as an increasingly authoritarian kremlin . kasparov said he was " very optimistic " about the movement , which is aimed at challenging the government of prime minister vladimir putin .
critics have accused putin of undermining democracy in russia . " it is impossible to reform this regime , " kasparov said .
" our first goal is to dismantle putin 's regime .
this is the only way to restore freedom and political competition in the country . " the party , which plans to present its manifesto in the spring , does not have any official status . more than 300 opposition politicians from 45 regions took part in the meeting to form the party , russian media reported . members of several organizations , citizen movements and parties , including members of the liberal yabloko party , were represented at the convention . " for the first time in russian history , a true democratic movement which unites thousands of people is being formed here , " founding member vladimir milov told the gathering .

berlin has denied participating in combat operations . information from a pair of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful , retired us general james marks told news weekly der spiegel in an article released ahead of publication monday , dec .
15 . " reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . " details provided by the bnd agents about iraqi troops ' preparations convinced us war planners to push ahead the invasion and prevented an attack on baghdad 's airport after the german spies alerted the us to air defenses and oil trenches , marks added . the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report . not involved in combat operations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public opinion in germany was opposed to the war in iraq officials in berlin on saturday said germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war in any way . " what foreign minster -lsb- frank-walter -rsb- steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said . as the chief of staff to then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was responsible for overseeing intelligence operations .
under schroeder , germany was staunchly opposed to the war in iraq , and schroeder won re-election in 2002 thanks in large part due to this opposition . us col. carol stewart , who worked on gen. tommy franks ' staff at us central command , however , in the past also praised the bnd for its " excellent work " in iraq . " whoever says that these reports did not play a role in combat operations is living on a different planet , " she said , according to the welt newspaper . steinmeier is scheduled to testify thursday in front of a parliamentary committee investigating whether germany provided intelligence information to the united states during the iraq war . he has repeatedly said the germany did not provide any " active support of combat operations , " but has also added that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . " opposition politicians involved in the parliamentary investigation have said they plan to invite both marks and stewart to expand on their remarks to the press in front of the committee . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have had meetings with mr. sarkozy , ms. merkel and mr. brown , but formally with the eu we 've never had an official meeting " he said .
" so the fact that now we have this framework to have this kind of summit will give the necessary advantage of high-level relations . "
but french foreign minister bernard kouchner said that " no political significance " should be attached to the decision to boost relations with israel .
" we also said ... that the ' deepening ' of relations with palestine would follow , " he told reporters .
it is " a little more difficult with the palestinians , because there is no state , so it will be more complicated . "
the palestinian authority has stood firmly against firmer eu-israel relations , insisting israel has not done enough to ease the humanitarian crisis in palestinian-inhabited areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for israel 's destruction common interests barak said israel would use the improved relations to work more closely with the eu on the question of iran , the palestinian conflict and israel 's northern border , which is shared with syria and lebanon .
" the three main aspects of our political agenda match with what is important for europe and stability in europe , " he said .
" these elements are part of our daily dialogue with the eu .
it 's not an easy task ... and the situation on the ground is not always an easy one .
but i think that being aware of the situation is important as is trying to solve all of this with a final status agreement -lrb- for palestine -rrb- .
" we know that membership of the eu is not in our cards so we are trying to improve our position with the eu . "

7 , that no major breakthroughs were likely in the immediate future .
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni stressed sunday that she would not sign " any agreement that does not serve israel 's interest and that is not detailed enough to be put into effect .
we are not there yet and it could take time . "
last november in the us city of annapolis , israeli and palestinian officials attempted to revive talks over solving key problems such as the status of jerusalem and the borders of a future palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said peace must serve israel 's interests barak , the deputy director-general , said that the presence of palestinian president mahmud abbas and livni at the egypt meeting sent a " strong message " that peace efforts were continuing .
" yes , the goal is a two-state solution .
we need more time , but we 're making progress .
yes , we would like to keep these conversations discreet .
yes , we ask the world , in particular the arab world , not to sit on the fence and try to offer support to the palestinians , " he said .

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has received a set of eu guarantees sarkozy confirmed this move . " the lisbon process is relaunched .
the irish will be consulted again ...
if all member states ratify the treaty , then every member state will have a commissioner , " sarkozy said .
following the summit , eu commission president barroso also called on president elect barack obama to join europe in its bold steps towards repariing the economy and climate change .

surprisingly however , some german businesses are coming out on top : used machinery and security services seem to be riding the storm . despite dire warnings of slowing economic growth , some german industries are still firmly in the black .
on the smaller scale , second-hand markets and thrift stores have always met the demand for cheap goods .
lately though , it is the second-hand heavy goods industry that is booming .
the security industry also seems to thrive on global uncertainties .
companies attempting to cut costs are outsourcing security to private firms , which - with the added fear-factor that has plagued society since 9/11 - are the beneficiaries of someone else 's crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the budget shrinks , companies look for used machinery it 's not the first time outsourcing has boosted the private sector .
the german military uses non-state companies for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
statistically however , the security industry 's growth rate has exceeded overall economic development .
" growth in this sector is likely to stay steady at between three and five percent , " said oliver arning of the german security services business association -lrb- bwds -rrb- .
" people just feel happier and safer when they feel the presence of security personnel . "
second-hand is in demand second-hand dealers are recession 's other winners with a growing demand for heavy goods and automobiles .
company directors and financiers in charge of the purse strings have become hesitant about investing in new goods and equipment .
" during economic lows people do n't want to invest in expensive , new equipment , " said jens nagel , director of the association of german exporters .
" we are seeing a surge in demand for good high-quality used machinery and equipment from germany . "
energy efficient and clean energy second-hand products have also become profit spinners , specifically in foodstuff production and packaging .
operating machinery and second-hand cars are another sector in high demand .
international markets broaden second-hand consumers are predominantly foreign buyers from recent eu member states or countries expecting to join the bloc in the near future .
according to nagel , imports of german used goods have risen in romania , bulgaria , the balkans and turkey .
more recently , interested buyers from africa have also joined the scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and future eu members drive the second-hand market nagel said he sees a similar trend developing in central asia .
" countries undergoing rapid economic growth often come looking for cheap high-quality machinery and equipment to keep pace with rising production . "
official estimates suggest that the used goods industry generates around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 131 billion -rrb- a year worldwide .
and this sector shows no signs of slowing , not at least while the credit crunch lasts .
florian hess , a trade fair organizer form karlsruhe , is still doing a tidy business .
he organizes the annual resale fair and is fairly certain that next year 's figures will put him ten percent up in profit .
" it 's a second-hand merchant 's market , " he said . klaus ulrich -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is historic what is happening here .
you will not find another continent in the world that is giving itself such binding targets " on climate change , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the summit in brussels , said friday , dec .
12 .
" europe has passed its credibility test .
we mean business when we speak about climate , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said .
key to clinching a climate deal on friday was an agreement to boost the funding of experimental power stations which would pump their greenhouse gases underground , officials close to the talks told dpa news agency .
sarkozy had proposed gifting such stations 200 million permits to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the main greenhouse gas -rrb- .
but after britain objected , that figure was raised to 300 million - a cash value of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- at current prices .
sarkozy had already won poland 's support by promising that polish power stations would get a substantial free allowance of co2 permits until 2020 , and german and italian approval by promising to give free permits to any industries threatened by competition from countries with less stringent climate-protection laws .
finance plan also agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is economic relief on the way now a plan has been agreed ?
the meeting also approved a plan by the european commission to give the eu 's economy a boost equivalent to " about 1.5 percent " of total economic output - weakening an earlier french call for it to be " at least " 1.5 percent .
" everybody has agreed that this is a very serious crisis .
everybody agrees that there is a need for an economic recovery on the basis of the -lrb- commission -rrb- plan , " sarkozy said .
however , eu leaders rejected a franco-british call for member states to cut vat on green goods and labor-intensive services such as restaurants , postponing the debate until a meeting of finance ministers in the spring .
strategy aligned for ireland the leaders also agreed to an irish plan aimed at winning popular support for the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which irish voters rejected in a referendum in june .
following a report from irish prime minister brian cowen , they promised to guarantee ireland 's independence on questions of tax , abortion and neutrality .
they also vowed that every member state would always be allowed to nominate a member of the commission - if the irish government tries to ratify the treaty by the end of october 2009 .
the guarantees to ireland can be made legally binding by writing them into a treaty for croatia 's accession to the eu in 2010 or 2011 , he said .
cowen applauded the guarantees , saying he was prepared to call a new referendum for the lisbon treaty .
" i have said that i would be prepared to return to the public with a new package and seek their approval of it , " he told reporters after the summit .

for the government 's response , see below .
dear jeremy , i am writing , as chair of the uk statistics authority , to express my concern about yesterday 's announcement of statistics related to knife crime .
it has been reported to me by the national statistician 's office that officials or advisers in no. 10 downing street caused the home office to issue a press release which prematurely published provisional statistics for hospital admissions for knife or sharp instrument wounding .
this press release said that " the number of teenagers admitted to hospital for knife or sharp instrument wounding in nine ... police force areas fell by 27 % according to new figures published today " .
these statistics were not due for publication for some time , and had not therefore been through the regular process of checking and quality assurance .
the statisticians who produced them , together with the national statistician , tried unsuccessfully to prevent their premature , irregular and selective release .
i hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics , and incompatible with the high standards which we are all seeking to establish .
i would be grateful for your comments , and for your assurance that there will be no repetition of this breach of the national statistics code of practice .
i am copying this letter to the cabinet secretary and to david normington at the home office ; and , because the uk statistics authority reports directly to parliament , to tony wright mp , chair of the public administration select committee and to keith vaz mp , chair of the home affairs select committee .
yours sincerely sir michael scholar full text of letter from jeremy heywood to sir michael scholar dear sir michael thank you for your letter of today 's date regarding the publication of statistics relating to knife crime .
first let me make clear that the prime minister and all his ministers , officials and advisers take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics .
in this case - given continuing strong public interest in knife crime trends and the government 's desire to make available the latest relevant management information and data as soon as possible , insufficient attention appears to have been given to the views of the nhs information centre statisticians on whether one specific data set included in the tackling knives action programme fact sheet was ready for publication .
the national statistician 's concern about this was only brought to no 10 's attention yesterday morning , after the data had already been released .
the prime minister remains strongly committed to building public trust in official statistics and to the new measures he has put in place to safeguard their independence .
in light of your letter , sir gus o 'donnell will discuss with the permanent secretaries of the departments involved and the national statistician any lessons to be learned from this case and remind all staff and advisers of the procedures that must be followed to protect the integrity of official statistics .
i am copying this letter to the recipients of yours and to hugh taylor at the department of health .

for the government 's response , see below .
dear jeremy , i am writing , as chair of the uk statistics authority , to express my concern about yesterday 's announcement of statistics related to knife crime .
it has been reported to me by the national statistician 's office that officials or advisers in no. 10 downing street caused the home office to issue a press release which prematurely published provisional statistics for hospital admissions for knife or sharp instrument wounding .
this press release said that " the number of teenagers admitted to hospital for knife or sharp instrument wounding in nine ... police force areas fell by 27 % according to new figures published today " .
these statistics were not due for publication for some time , and had not therefore been through the regular process of checking and quality assurance .
the statisticians who produced them , together with the national statistician , tried unsuccessfully to prevent their premature , irregular and selective release .
i hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics , and incompatible with the high standards which we are all seeking to establish .
i would be grateful for your comments , and for your assurance that there will be no repetition of this breach of the national statistics code of practice .
i am copying this letter to the cabinet secretary and to david normington at the home office ; and , because the uk statistics authority reports directly to parliament , to tony wright mp , chair of the public administration select committee and to keith vaz mp , chair of the home affairs select committee .
yours sincerely sir michael scholar full text of letter from jeremy heywood to sir michael scholar dear sir michael thank you for your letter of today 's date regarding the publication of statistics relating to knife crime .
first let me make clear that the prime minister and all his ministers , officials and advisers take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics .
in this case - given continuing strong public interest in knife crime trends and the government 's desire to make available the latest relevant management information and data as soon as possible , insufficient attention appears to have been given to the views of the nhs information centre statisticians on whether one specific data set included in the tackling knives action programme fact sheet was ready for publication .
the national statistician 's concern about this was only brought to no 10 's attention yesterday morning , after the data had already been released .
the prime minister remains strongly committed to building public trust in official statistics and to the new measures he has put in place to safeguard their independence .
in light of your letter , sir gus o 'donnell will discuss with the permanent secretaries of the departments involved and the national statistician any lessons to be learned from this case and remind all staff and advisers of the procedures that must be followed to protect the integrity of official statistics .
i am copying this letter to the recipients of yours and to hugh taylor at the department of health .

first let me make clear that the prime minister and all his ministers , officials and advisers take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics .
in this case - given continuing strong public interest in knife crime trends and the government 's desire to make available the latest relevant management information and data as soon as possible , insufficient attention appears to have been given to the views of the nhs information centre statisticians on whether one specific data set included in the tackling knives action programme fact sheet was ready for publication .
the national statistician 's concern about this was only brought to no 10 's attention yesterday morning , after the data had already been released .
the prime minister remains strongly committed to building public trust in official statistics and to the new measures he has put in place to safeguard their independence .
in light of your letter , sir gus o 'donnell will discuss with the permanent secretaries of the departments involved and the national statistician any lessons to be learned from this case and remind all staff and advisers of the procedures that must be followed to protect the integrity of official statistics .
i am copying this letter to the recipients of yours and to hugh taylor at the department of health .

sir michael scholar , head of the uk statistics authority , said officials pleaded with no 10 not to release " unchecked " and " selective " numbers .
the government admitted " insufficient attention " was given to the authority 's views on releasing the data .
mps are to carry out an inquiry into the release of the data .
the government 's decision has also been criticised by senior labour backbenchers .
the authority 's protests were over-ruled by ministers eager to show a crackdown on knife crime in england was working .
responding to sir michael 's letter of complaint , permanent secretary at 10 downing street , jeremy heywood said " the prime minister and all his ministers , officials and advisers take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics " .
but he added : " in this case ... insufficient attention appears to have been given to the views of the nhs information centre statisticians on whether one specific data set included in the tackling knives action programme fact sheet was ready for publication . "
' political manipulation ' in a press release issued on thursday , number 10 and the home office said there had been a sharp fall in the number of teenagers caught carrying knives in england and hospital admissions due to knife wounds in areas targeted by police .
they pointed to a 17 % fall in serious injuries and deaths across nine police force areas over the past six months as well as a 27 % fall in hospital admissions .
sir michael told the bbc that government statisticians had asked number 10 not to publish the data until march when the knife crime campaign would have ended and it could be properly checked and published in its proper context .
asked why downing street had acted against the advice of officials , he said : " the government was making a series of announcements about this issue and felt its case would be put better if it could publish these numbers . "
" i hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics " sir michael scholar , uk statistics authority mark easton 's blog in full : watchdog 's letter the government had " breached " the code governing official statistics by publishing just " one part " of the numbers .
tony wright , the labour chairman of the commons public administration committee , said his committee will carry out the inquiry .
he told the bbc 's today programme : " we are going to find out exactly what happened in this case and make sure that an edict goes out across whitehall that it never happens again .
" we need to find out who in number 10 and who in the home office thought they could do this . "
he added : " there is a new regime for the release of official statistics and this breaks the rules and it should n't have done . "
conservative leader david cameron said an apology was needed from gordon brown .
he told sky news : " we are not going to get anywhere with a government giving us dodgy statistics and deliberately disobeying what its own statistics authority is saying .
" it really is an appalling way to behave .
the prime minister has got to own up to it , he 's got to apologise for it and he 's got to make sure it never happens again . "
' accurate statistics ' immigration minister phil woolas said the government had to accept the criticism but denied the figures had been manipulated .
" the idea that there is a conspiracy behind this , i goodness wish that whitehall was so sophisticated , i can assure you it 's not .
" but the fact of the matter is that crime by knives has fallen , an that surely is what is important . "
however keith vaz , labour mp and chairman of the commons home affairs committee , said the early release of figures " greatly undermined " public trust in the government .
he said : " it is important that we have accurate statistics that we can rely upon in order to craft policy to resolve problems as well to gauge when legislation is working .
public trust is greatly undermined by actions such as this . "
the bbc 's mark easton said the episode was damaging for trust in crime figures and official statistics in general .
the figures covered the period since the home office launched a £ 2m campaign in june to crack down on knife carrying in 10 " hotspots " including london , greater manchester and the west midlands .

he told the bbc 's today programme : " we are going to find out exactly what happened in this case and make sure that an edict goes out across whitehall that it never happens again .
" we need to find out who in number 10 and who in the home office thought they could do this . "
he added : " there is a new regime for the release of official statistics and this breaks the rules and it should n't have done . "
conservative leader david cameron said an apology was needed from gordon brown .
he told sky news : " we are not going to get anywhere with a government giving us dodgy statistics and deliberately disobeying what its own statistics authority is saying .
" it really is an appalling way to behave .
the prime minister has got to own up to it , he 's got to apologise for it and he 's got to make sure it never happens again . "
' accurate statistics ' immigration minister phil woolas said the government had to accept the criticism but denied the figures had been manipulated .
" the idea that there is a conspiracy behind this , i goodness wish that whitehall was so sophisticated , i can assure you it 's not .

however keith vaz , labour mp and chairman of the commons home affairs committee , said the early release of figures " greatly undermined " public trust in the government .
he said : " it is important that we have accurate statistics that we can rely upon in order to craft policy to resolve problems as well to gauge when legislation is working .

the bbc 's mark easton said the episode was damaging for trust in crime figures and official statistics in general .

sir michael scholar , head of the uk statistics authority , said officials pleaded with no 10 not to release " unchecked " and " selective " numbers .
the government admitted " insufficient attention " was given to the authority 's views on releasing the data .
mps are to carry out an inquiry into the release of the data .
the government 's decision has also been criticised by senior labour backbenchers .
the authority 's protests were over-ruled by ministers eager to show a crackdown on knife crime in england was working .
responding to sir michael 's letter of complaint , permanent secretary at 10 downing street , jeremy heywood said " the prime minister and all his ministers , officials and advisers take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics " .
but he added : " in this case ... insufficient attention appears to have been given to the views of the nhs information centre statisticians on whether one specific data set included in the tackling knives action programme fact sheet was ready for publication . "
' political manipulation ' in a press release issued on thursday , number 10 and the home office said there had been a sharp fall in the number of teenagers caught carrying knives in england and hospital admissions due to knife wounds in areas targeted by police .
they pointed to a 17 % fall in serious injuries and deaths across nine police force areas over the past six months as well as a 27 % fall in hospital admissions .
sir michael told the bbc that government statisticians had asked number 10 not to publish the data until march when the knife crime campaign would have ended and it could be properly checked and published in its proper context .
asked why downing street had acted against the advice of officials , he said : " the government was making a series of announcements about this issue and felt its case would be put better if it could publish these numbers . "
i hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics sir michael scholar , uk statistics authority mark easton 's blog in full : watchdog 's letter the government had " breached " the code governing official statistics by publishing just " one part " of the numbers .
tony wright , the labour chairman of the commons public administration committee , said his committee will carry out the inquiry .
he told the bbc 's today programme : " we are going to find out exactly what happened in this case and make sure that an edict goes out across whitehall that it never happens again .
" we need to find out who in number 10 and who in the home office thought they could do this . "
he added : " there is a new regime for the release of official statistics and this breaks the rules and it should n't have done . "
conservative leader david cameron said an apology was needed from gordon brown .
he told sky news : " we are not going to get anywhere with a government giving us dodgy statistics and deliberately disobeying what its own statistics authority is saying .
" it really is an appalling way to behave .
the prime minister has got to own up to it , he 's got to apologise for it and he 's got to make sure it never happens again . "
' accurate statistics ' immigration minister phil woolas said the government had to accept the criticism but denied the figures had been manipulated .
" the idea that there is a conspiracy behind this , i goodness wish that whitehall was so sophisticated , i can assure you it 's not .
" but the fact of the matter is that crime by knives has fallen , an that surely is what is important . "
however keith vaz , labour mp and chairman of the commons home affairs committee , said the early release of figures " greatly undermined " public trust in the government .
he said : " it is important that we have accurate statistics that we can rely upon in order to craft policy to resolve problems as well to gauge when legislation is working .
public trust is greatly undermined by actions such as this . "
the bbc 's mark easton said the episode was damaging for trust in crime figures and official statistics in general .
the figures covered the period since the home office launched a £ 2m campaign in june to crack down on knife carrying in 10 " hotspots " including london , greater manchester and the west midlands .

the disused wards at cefn coed hospital in swansea are set to be demolished but work can not begin until the bat have an alternative home to move into .
now the abm university nhs trust is to submit a planning application to build the home in the hospital 's grounds .
its hoped the bat house could be ready for the creatures ' spring return from their winter hibernation caves .
paul stauber , the trust 's director of planning , said : " the buildings are disused wards and have been derelict for some time .
" they are not only an eyesore , but are subject to vandalism and theft , and we have had to put extra fencing and 24-hour security presence on site as a result .
the bat house will allow the old hospital wards to be demolished " they need to be demolished , and we hope to start knocking them down early in 2009 .
but before that happens , the bats must have a new home ready .
mr stauber said the bat house will look little different from an average wooden garden shed .
but it has been carefully designed by the trust 's consultant ecologists and bat experts from the countryside council for wales to ensure it is the perfect habitat for the bats to thrive .
" we will shortly be asking the city and county of swansea for planning permission to erect the bat house and , once that 's done , we can begin demolishing the old buildings , " added mr stauber .
the old wards at cefn coed have been targeted over the past year by vandals , and thieves eager to help themselves to valuable roofing lead , he said .
by stripping the roof they also exposed asbestos which for safety reasons has had to be made secure .
demolition team mr stauber added : " thieves pretending to be trust and council workers have accessed the site via private nearby residences , and i am sure residents living nearby will be very glad to see these old buildings razed to the ground . "
a specialist demolition team will dispose of the asbestos as the buildings come down .
the work is expected to take a few weeks and local residents will be kept informed about the timetable of works .
another planning application will be made later to use most of the cleared hospital site for a housing development .
a small section , close to the hospital chapel , is also earmarked for replacement buildings for long-stay patients .

now the abm university nhs trust is to submit a planning application to build the home in the hospital 's grounds .
its hoped the bat house could be ready for the creatures ' spring return from their winter hibernation caves .
paul stauber , the trust 's director of planning , said : " the buildings are disused wards and have been derelict for some time .
" they are not only an eyesore , but are subject to vandalism and theft , and we have had to put extra fencing and 24-hour security presence on site as a result .
the bat house will allow the old hospital wards to be demolished " they need to be demolished , and we hope to start knocking them down early in 2009 .
but before that happens , the bats must have a new home ready .
mr stauber said the bat house will look little different from an average wooden garden shed .
but it has been carefully designed by the trust 's consultant ecologists and bat experts from the countryside council for wales to ensure it is the perfect habitat for the bats to thrive .
" we will shortly be asking the city and county of swansea for planning permission to erect the bat house and , once that 's done , we can begin demolishing the old buildings , " added mr stauber .
the old wards at cefn coed have been targeted over the past year by vandals , and thieves eager to help themselves to valuable roofing lead , he said .
by stripping the roof they also exposed asbestos which for safety reasons has had to be made secure .
demolition team mr stauber added : " thieves pretending to be trust and council workers have accessed the site via private nearby residences , and i am sure residents living nearby will be very glad to see these old buildings razed to the ground . "
a specialist demolition team will dispose of the asbestos as the buildings come down .
the work is expected to take a few weeks and local residents will be kept informed about the timetable of works .
another planning application will be made later to use most of the cleared hospital site for a housing development .
a small section , close to the hospital chapel , is also earmarked for replacement buildings for long-stay patients .
