but critics of the deal say that the change is largely cosmetic . ending years of dispute among the country 's croat , predominantly muslim bosniak and serb leaders , bosnian lawmakers on wednesday , april 16 , approved reform bills geared at merging the police forces that have been separated along ethnic lines so far . eu enlargement officer olli rehn welcomed the move and said that the way had been paved to sign a so-called stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which is the first step towards eventual eu membership . the saa " will not only bring practical benefits in trade and thus for the economy of bosnia and herzegovina , but it is also the gateway towards candidate country status for eu accession , " rehn said , according to afp news service . while eu foreign ministers could sign the agreement as early as their next meeting on april 29 , they 're more likely to do so in may or june . serbian resistance since the 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two autonomous areas : the serb republika srpska and the bosniak-croat federation .
the bosnian serbs had resisted any proposals to merge the separate police forces , but now agreed on a watered-down compromise . the reform bills call for the creation of seven central-government bodies to coordinate the country 's police forces within a year after constitutional reform - which is not expected in the near future . eu officials , who had pushed for and end to separation of the forces along ethnic lines , have said that they 'd be willing to accept the bosnian agreement as long as it makes sure that ethnic bias is no longer an issue within the force . critics of the reform bill said that serbs had basically managed to block any real change . " the adopted law will not change the existing situation , " said alma colo of the bosniak nationalist party of democratic action -lrb- sda -rrb- , according to dpa news service . the lesser evil others , however , said that the deal had to be seen in terms of bosnia 's future within the eu . " it 's difficult to say if these laws are good , because nothing is absolutely good , " branko zrno , a croat parliamentarian , told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" it is true they do not resolve all the issues , but we have agreed on them in the interest of the -lrb- saa -rrb- signature . " bosnia , serbia and kosovo are the only states of the former yugoslavia that still have not singed saas .
relations between serbia and the eu soured after several members , including germany , recognized kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . slovenia is the only former yugoslav state that is already an eu member .

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .
in the space of 90 minutes , kuranyi went from the middle of the pack to the upper ranks of the bundesliga 's scoring list - and achieved a bit of personal redemption . long recovery from despair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has had to bear a lot of frustration the past two years as recently as last year , kuranyi was still bitter about what he called " the biggest disappointment of my year " - former germany coach juergen klinsmann 's decision to leave him off of the world cup squad . after learning he was out , kuranyi vented his feelings online in a blog entry . " i 'm truly speechless , " the striker wrote .
" i 'm deeply disappointed and know i am in for some sleepless nights .
i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .
but his second goal in particular - a 29-meter blast after a bit of nifty dribbling - showed that an in-form kuranyi can create - and convert - opportunities . and with klose having only scored once in the second half of the season , ironically against schalke on march 1 , kuranyi could make a case that he belong in germany 's starting 11 .
after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the president has made a disappointing speech that does not match up to the global challenge , " gabriel said thursday , april 17 , in reference to bush 's announcement a day priop on us emissions policy . in his speech , bush called for the growth in us greenhouse gas emissions to be stopped by 2025 " and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance . " bush said this were " realistic goals , " whereas " the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy . " the us president 's words marked a backward step from the united nations climate conference held in bali in december , where the us delegation made a last-minute decision to support a final summit document after previously opposing it , gabriel said . a need for caps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is n't leading as far as gabriel is concerned the german environment minister criticized bush 's refusal to back legislation to cap greenhouse-gas emissions . " without binding upper limits and reductions targets for the industrialized countries , climate change will not be stopped , " gabriel said .
" europe and the us must take the lead if others are to follow . " instead , with his proposals , the president is limping hopelessly behind , " he added .
" we are glad that there are other voices in the us . " stepping backwards the environment minister noted that the third meeting of the 16 so-called major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- -lrb- formerly major emitters meeting -rrb- was taking place in paris on thursday and friday , and said bush 's speech ran the risk of undermining a process initiated by the us itself . mem aims to draw together the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- countries with major developing economies , such as china , india and brazil , to combat climate change .
together , the 16 countries account for some 80 percent of world greenhouse-gas emissions . bush proposed the initiative ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june last year as a counterproposal to the kyoto protocol and mem was launched in september . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .
he 's raced in a number of hobby motorcycling events this year and done well - until the race in france .
but having gotten a bit more intimately acquainted with the tar in bresse than he probably would have liked , he might want to consider a set of training wheels while he gets the hang of the two-wheel thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .
he 's raced in a number of hobby motorcycling events this year and done well - until the race in france .
but having gotten a bit more intimately acquainted with the tar in bresse than he probably would have liked , he might want to consider a set of training wheels while he gets the hang of the two-wheel thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .
in the space of 90 minutes , kuranyi went from the middle of the pack to the upper ranks of the bundesliga 's scoring list - and achieved a bit of personal redemption . long recovery from despair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has had to bear a lot of frustration the past two years as recently as last year , kuranyi was still bitter about what he called " the biggest disappointment of my year " - former germany coach juergen klinsmann 's decision to leave him off of the world cup squad . after learning he was out , kuranyi vented his feelings online in a blog entry . " i 'm truly speechless , " the striker wrote .
" i 'm deeply disappointed and know i am in for some sleepless nights .
i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .
but his second goal in particular - a 29-meter blast after a bit of nifty dribbling - showed that an in-form kuranyi can create - and convert - opportunities . and with klose having only scored once in the second half of the season , ironically against schalke on march 1 , kuranyi could make a case that he belong in germany 's starting 11 .
after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .

" a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .

the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " i would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
too many foreigners , school kids say the results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among german school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in bad saarow , in the state of brandenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans said there were too many foreigners in germany in the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third german school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in germany .
another third said they pretty much agreed .
one in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners . the initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the interior ministry and the crime research institute of lower saxony , were published on thursday in the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .

schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " i would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
too many foreigners , school kids say the results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among german school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in bad saarow , in the state of brandenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans said there were too many foreigners in germany in the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third german school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in germany .
another third said they pretty much agreed .
one in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners . the initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the interior ministry and the crime research institute of lower saxony , were published on thursday in the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .
but the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the constitutional court . " it would be the greatest propaganda success the npd could achieve , " schoenbohm , a christian democrat , said . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .
losing steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd benefits from public money the cdu ministers have instead proposed that the npd be combated by changing legislation to prevent it from receiving government subsidies .
the npd has about 7,000 members and has seats in two regional state parliaments , both in the former communist east .
as a legitimate political party , it gets over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- in public funding per year . interior minister schaeuble had called for an end to the debate on wednesday . but berlin 's koerting , a social democrat , said the federal government coalition of christian democrats and social democrats should address it . " i have no doubt that the material is sufficient to prove the npd is hostile to the constitution , also at the constitutional court , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de proposed ban on right-wing npd loses steam germany 's interior minister said it 's " high time " the social democrats abandon their push for a ban of the right-wing npd .
the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely .

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .
" but the 2007 oscar-winner ' the lives of others ' marked a watershed as it dared to give the stasi a human face . " mendacious movies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main character in " the lives of others " was dismissed by many as unrealistic but to others , humanizing the stasi was precisely what made florian henckel von donnersmarck 's critically acclaimed thriller mendacious and misleading . as the movie scooped every prize going , former civil rights activist werner schulz wrote in the online version of die welt newspaper that it failed to reflect the harsh reality of life in communist east germany . " a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .
" but everybody has his own story and the man in this one simply did not know any better . " i think we should be more sensitive about individual destinies , " she added .
" nothing is ever black and white - that 's just too easy and cozy . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 18.02.2008 -rrb- they do n't know how unlucky they were , back in the gdr " the gdr will be nothing but a footnote in history , " said writer stefan heym in 1990 .
he turned out to be right - but young people 's ignorance of the not-so-distant past is now a cause for concern to education experts .

schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

" it would be the greatest propaganda success the npd could achieve , " schoenbohm , a christian democrat , said . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .
in the space of 90 minutes , kuranyi went from the middle of the pack to the upper ranks of the bundesliga 's scoring list - and achieved a bit of personal redemption . long recovery from despair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has had to bear a lot of frustration the past two years as recently as last year , kuranyi was still bitter about what he called " the biggest disappointment of my year " - former germany coach juergen klinsmann 's decision to leave him off of the world cup squad . after learning he was out , kuranyi vented his feelings online in a blog entry . " i 'm truly speechless , " the striker wrote .
" i 'm deeply disappointed and know i am in for some sleepless nights .
i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .
but his second goal in particular - a 29-meter blast after a bit of nifty dribbling - showed that an in-form kuranyi can create - and convert - opportunities . and with klose having only scored once in the second half of the season , ironically against schalke on march 1 , kuranyi could make a case that he belong in germany 's starting 11 .
after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .

" this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .
but the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the constitutional court . " it would be the greatest propaganda success the npd could achieve , " schoenbohm , a christian democrat , said . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .

the npd has about 7,000 members and has seats in two regional state parliaments , both in the former communist east .
as a legitimate political party , it gets over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- in public funding per year . interior minister schaeuble had called for an end to the debate on wednesday . but berlin 's koerting , a social democrat , said the federal government coalition of christian democrats and social democrats should address it .

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " i would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
too many foreigners , school kids say the results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among german school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in bad saarow , in the state of brandenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans said there were too many foreigners in germany in the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third german school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in germany .
another third said they pretty much agreed .
one in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners . the initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the interior ministry and the crime research institute of lower saxony , were published on thursday in the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .
but the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the constitutional court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .
" but the 2007 oscar-winner ' the lives of others ' marked a watershed as it dared to give the stasi a human face . " mendacious movies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main character in " the lives of others " was dismissed by many as unrealistic but to others , humanizing the stasi was precisely what made florian henckel von donnersmarck 's critically acclaimed thriller mendacious and misleading . as the movie scooped every prize going , former civil rights activist werner schulz wrote in the online version of die welt newspaper that it failed to reflect the harsh reality of life in communist east germany . " a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .
" but everybody has his own story and the man in this one simply did not know any better . " i think we should be more sensitive about individual destinies , " she added .

" " the president has made a disappointing speech that does not match up to the global challenge , " gabriel said thursday , april 17 , in reference to bush 's announcement a day priop on us emissions policy . in his speech , bush called for the growth in us greenhouse gas emissions to be stopped by 2025 " and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance . " bush said this were " realistic goals , " whereas " the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy . " the us president 's words marked a backward step from the united nations climate conference held in bali in december , where the us delegation made a last-minute decision to support a final summit document after previously opposing it , gabriel said . a need for caps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is n't leading as far as gabriel is concerned the german environment minister criticized bush 's refusal to back legislation to cap greenhouse-gas emissions . " without binding upper limits and reductions targets for the industrialized countries , climate change will not be stopped , " gabriel said .
" europe and the us must take the lead if others are to follow . " instead , with his proposals , the president is limping hopelessly behind , " he added .
" we are glad that there are other voices in the us . " stepping backwards the environment minister noted that the third meeting of the 16 so-called major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- -lrb- formerly major emitters meeting -rrb- was taking place in paris on thursday and friday , and said bush 's speech ran the risk of undermining a process initiated by the us itself . mem aims to draw together the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- countries with major developing economies , such as china , india and brazil , to combat climate change .
together , the 16 countries account for some 80 percent of world greenhouse-gas emissions . bush proposed the initiative ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june last year as a counterproposal to the kyoto protocol and mem was launched in september . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .
" but the 2007 oscar-winner ' the lives of others ' marked a watershed as it dared to give the stasi a human face . " mendacious movies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main character in " the lives of others " was dismissed by many as unrealistic but to others , humanizing the stasi was precisely what made florian henckel von donnersmarck 's critically acclaimed thriller mendacious and misleading . as the movie scooped every prize going , former civil rights activist werner schulz wrote in the online version of die welt newspaper that it failed to reflect the harsh reality of life in communist east germany . " a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .
" but everybody has his own story and the man in this one simply did not know any better . " i think we should be more sensitive about individual destinies , " she added .

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .
he 's raced in a number of hobby motorcycling events this year and done well - until the race in france .
but having gotten a bit more intimately acquainted with the tar in bresse than he probably would have liked , he might want to consider a set of training wheels while he gets the hang of the two-wheel thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " i would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
too many foreigners , school kids say the results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among german school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in bad saarow , in the state of brandenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans said there were too many foreigners in germany in the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third german school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in germany .
another third said they pretty much agreed .
one in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners . the initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the interior ministry and the crime research institute of lower saxony , were published on thursday in the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .
but the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the constitutional court . " it would be the greatest propaganda success the npd could achieve , " schoenbohm , a christian democrat , said . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .
losing steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd benefits from public money the cdu ministers have instead proposed that the npd be combated by changing legislation to prevent it from receiving government subsidies .
the npd has about 7,000 members and has seats in two regional state parliaments , both in the former communist east .
as a legitimate political party , it gets over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- in public funding per year . interior minister schaeuble had called for an end to the debate on wednesday . but berlin 's koerting , a social democrat , said the federal government coalition of christian democrats and social democrats should address it . " i have no doubt that the material is sufficient to prove the npd is hostile to the constitution , also at the constitutional court , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de proposed ban on right-wing npd loses steam germany 's interior minister said it 's " high time " the social democrats abandon their push for a ban of the right-wing npd .
the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely .
-lrb- 13.04.2008 -rrb- germany feels pressure to aid more christian iraqis germany is debating whether to give visas to more iraqi christian refugees , given their widespread mistreatment at home .
but some argue that singling out one minority is unfair .

no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency .

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .
in the space of 90 minutes , kuranyi went from the middle of the pack to the upper ranks of the bundesliga 's scoring list - and achieved a bit of personal redemption . long recovery from despair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has had to bear a lot of frustration the past two years as recently as last year , kuranyi was still bitter about what he called " the biggest disappointment of my year " - former germany coach juergen klinsmann 's decision to leave him off of the world cup squad . after learning he was out , kuranyi vented his feelings online in a blog entry . " i 'm truly speechless , " the striker wrote .
" i 'm deeply disappointed and know i am in for some sleepless nights .
i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .
but his second goal in particular - a 29-meter blast after a bit of nifty dribbling - showed that an in-form kuranyi can create - and convert - opportunities . and with klose having only scored once in the second half of the season , ironically against schalke on march 1 , kuranyi could make a case that he belong in germany 's starting 11 .
after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.04.2008 opinion : no reason for recession talk in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading economic research institutes on thursday , april 17 , published their outlook for the coming year .
according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .
he 's raced in a number of hobby motorcycling events this year and done well - until the race in france .
but having gotten a bit more intimately acquainted with the tar in bresse than he probably would have liked , he might want to consider a set of training wheels while he gets the hang of the two-wheel thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .
he 's raced in a number of hobby motorcycling events this year and done well - until the race in france .
but having gotten a bit more intimately acquainted with the tar in bresse than he probably would have liked , he might want to consider a set of training wheels while he gets the hang of the two-wheel thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " i would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
too many foreigners , school kids say the results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among german school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in bad saarow , in the state of brandenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans said there were too many foreigners in germany in the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third german school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in germany .
another third said they pretty much agreed .
one in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners . the initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the interior ministry and the crime research institute of lower saxony , were published on thursday in the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .
but the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the constitutional court . " it would be the greatest propaganda success the npd could achieve , " schoenbohm , a christian democrat , said . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .
losing steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd benefits from public money the cdu ministers have instead proposed that the npd be combated by changing legislation to prevent it from receiving government subsidies .
the npd has about 7,000 members and has seats in two regional state parliaments , both in the former communist east .
as a legitimate political party , it gets over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- in public funding per year . interior minister schaeuble had called for an end to the debate on wednesday . but berlin 's koerting , a social democrat , said the federal government coalition of christian democrats and social democrats should address it . " i have no doubt that the material is sufficient to prove the npd is hostile to the constitution , also at the constitutional court , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .

i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .

after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .

there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .

they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .

but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .

how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .
in the space of 90 minutes , kuranyi went from the middle of the pack to the upper ranks of the bundesliga 's scoring list - and achieved a bit of personal redemption . long recovery from despair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has had to bear a lot of frustration the past two years as recently as last year , kuranyi was still bitter about what he called " the biggest disappointment of my year " - former germany coach juergen klinsmann 's decision to leave him off of the world cup squad . after learning he was out , kuranyi vented his feelings online in a blog entry . " i 'm truly speechless , " the striker wrote .
" i 'm deeply disappointed and know i am in for some sleepless nights .
i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .
but his second goal in particular - a 29-meter blast after a bit of nifty dribbling - showed that an in-form kuranyi can create - and convert - opportunities . and with klose having only scored once in the second half of the season , ironically against schalke on march 1 , kuranyi could make a case that he belong in germany 's starting 11 .
after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the president has made a disappointing speech that does not match up to the global challenge , " gabriel said thursday , april 17 , in reference to bush 's announcement a day priop on us emissions policy . in his speech , bush called for the growth in us greenhouse gas emissions to be stopped by 2025 " and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance . " bush said this were " realistic goals , " whereas " the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy . " the us president 's words marked a backward step from the united nations climate conference held in bali in december , where the us delegation made a last-minute decision to support a final summit document after previously opposing it , gabriel said . a need for caps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is n't leading as far as gabriel is concerned the german environment minister criticized bush 's refusal to back legislation to cap greenhouse-gas emissions . " without binding upper limits and reductions targets for the industrialized countries , climate change will not be stopped , " gabriel said .
" europe and the us must take the lead if others are to follow . " instead , with his proposals , the president is limping hopelessly behind , " he added .
" we are glad that there are other voices in the us . " stepping backwards the environment minister noted that the third meeting of the 16 so-called major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- -lrb- formerly major emitters meeting -rrb- was taking place in paris on thursday and friday , and said bush 's speech ran the risk of undermining a process initiated by the us itself . mem aims to draw together the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- countries with major developing economies , such as china , india and brazil , to combat climate change .
together , the 16 countries account for some 80 percent of world greenhouse-gas emissions . bush proposed the initiative ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june last year as a counterproposal to the kyoto protocol and mem was launched in september . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.04.2008 opinion : no reason for recession talk in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading economic research institutes on thursday , april 17 , published their outlook for the coming year .
according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.04.2008 opinion : no reason for recession talk in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading economic research institutes on thursday , april 17 , published their outlook for the coming year .
according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .
" but the 2007 oscar-winner ' the lives of others ' marked a watershed as it dared to give the stasi a human face . " mendacious movies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main character in " the lives of others " was dismissed by many as unrealistic but to others , humanizing the stasi was precisely what made florian henckel von donnersmarck 's critically acclaimed thriller mendacious and misleading . as the movie scooped every prize going , former civil rights activist werner schulz wrote in the online version of die welt newspaper that it failed to reflect the harsh reality of life in communist east germany . " a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .
" but everybody has his own story and the man in this one simply did not know any better . " i think we should be more sensitive about individual destinies , " she added .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "

but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division .

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .

schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

the couple met and fell in love in 1981 when kaiser was imprisoned by the east german communist regime for cultivating contacts in west germany and karlstedt was the ambitious young officer placed in charge of her interrogation . the attraction remained unspoken , and kaiser was sentenced to jail for three years .
but 16 years later , she tracked down her one-time tormentor to tell him how she felt .
they married and , in 2003 , published an account of their love story , which was adapted for the small screen and aired wednesday , april 16 . controversial theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor devid striesow played uwe whether her feelings can be attributed to stockholm syndrome - the emotional attachment to their captor sometimes experienced by hostages - or simply prove that there 's no knowing when love can strike , kaiser 's response has apparently been hard for german audiences to understand . ahead of its screening , the film drew comparisons to liliana cavani 's controversial 1974 movie " the night porter , " which starred charlotte rampling as a concentration camp survivor who renews a relationship 13 years after the end of world war ii with the former nazi ss officer who once persecuted her . both films were accused of sensationalism . " as nasty as it is lubricious , a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering , " said critic roger ebert about " the night porter . " diminishing suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe this week , historian hubertus knabe , the director of the memorial center at the former berlin-hohenschoenhausen prison used by the stasi , accused ard channel of commissioning a voyeuristic film that diminishes the suffering of the 200,000 people who were thrown in jail by east germany 's secret police , the stasi . " this film gives millions of people a skewed image of what it was like to be detained by the stasi , " he said in a statement .
" the time the stasi victims spent in jail were the worst moments of their lives .
none of them felt any love for the secret police members who interrogated them . " this extremely complex subject is not appropriate material for primetime television , " he said , adding that the movie conveyed the impression that being remanded on custody in the gdr was like " visiting a dating agency . " fair opinion meanwhile , der spiegel newsmagazine reported that eight victims ' associations had appealed in vain over the last year to the television station that produced the film , mdr , to halt production . " everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .
" but the 2007 oscar-winner ' the lives of others ' marked a watershed as it dared to give the stasi a human face . " mendacious movies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main character in " the lives of others " was dismissed by many as unrealistic but to others , humanizing the stasi was precisely what made florian henckel von donnersmarck 's critically acclaimed thriller mendacious and misleading . as the movie scooped every prize going , former civil rights activist werner schulz wrote in the online version of die welt newspaper that it failed to reflect the harsh reality of life in communist east germany . " a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .
" but everybody has his own story and the man in this one simply did not know any better . " i think we should be more sensitive about individual destinies , " she added .

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " i would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
too many foreigners , school kids say the results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among german school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in bad saarow , in the state of brandenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans said there were too many foreigners in germany in the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third german school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in germany .
another third said they pretty much agreed .
one in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners . the initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the interior ministry and the crime research institute of lower saxony , were published on thursday in the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
far-right ban the ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far-right npd party , which has been mooted by social democrats . the officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm said .
but the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the constitutional court . " it would be the greatest propaganda success the npd could achieve , " schoenbohm , a christian democrat , said . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .
losing steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd benefits from public money the cdu ministers have instead proposed that the npd be combated by changing legislation to prevent it from receiving government subsidies .
the npd has about 7,000 members and has seats in two regional state parliaments , both in the former communist east .
as a legitimate political party , it gets over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- in public funding per year . interior minister schaeuble had called for an end to the debate on wednesday . but berlin 's koerting , a social democrat , said the federal government coalition of christian democrats and social democrats should address it . " i have no doubt that the material is sufficient to prove the npd is hostile to the constitution , also at the constitutional court , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de proposed ban on right-wing npd loses steam germany 's interior minister said it 's " high time " the social democrats abandon their push for a ban of the right-wing npd .
the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely .

" " the president has made a disappointing speech that does not match up to the global challenge , " gabriel said thursday , april 17 , in reference to bush 's announcement a day priop on us emissions policy . in his speech , bush called for the growth in us greenhouse gas emissions to be stopped by 2025 " and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance . " bush said this were " realistic goals , " whereas " the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy . " the us president 's words marked a backward step from the united nations climate conference held in bali in december , where the us delegation made a last-minute decision to support a final summit document after previously opposing it , gabriel said . a need for caps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is n't leading as far as gabriel is concerned the german environment minister criticized bush 's refusal to back legislation to cap greenhouse-gas emissions . " without binding upper limits and reductions targets for the industrialized countries , climate change will not be stopped , " gabriel said .
" europe and the us must take the lead if others are to follow . " instead , with his proposals , the president is limping hopelessly behind , " he added .
" we are glad that there are other voices in the us . " stepping backwards the environment minister noted that the third meeting of the 16 so-called major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- -lrb- formerly major emitters meeting -rrb- was taking place in paris on thursday and friday , and said bush 's speech ran the risk of undermining a process initiated by the us itself . mem aims to draw together the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- countries with major developing economies , such as china , india and brazil , to combat climate change .
together , the 16 countries account for some 80 percent of world greenhouse-gas emissions . bush proposed the initiative ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june last year as a counterproposal to the kyoto protocol and mem was launched in september . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .

fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .

but driving a car and driving a motorcycle are two different animals - as schumi found out in a race in france . michael schumacher had a short day indeed last week at a race for hobby motorcyclists in bresse , france .
going into the first curve , the seven-time formula 1 champion improperly braked , nudged one of his fellow drivers and went skidding along the track .
other racers had to take immediate evasive action to avoid squashing schumi .
a motorcycling expert with the highly developed sense of the obvious later said that the german had put himself and others at considerable risk .
" motorcycling has gotten very safe , " superbike driver juergen oelschlager told the daily bild newspaper .
" but if you crash and another driver runs over you with his bike , it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
fortunately , schumi was spared such a fate .
he walked away from the accident with his ego bruised , but his body still intact .
schumacher retired from formula 1 in 2006 but has had difficulty cooling his passion for loud motors and high speeds .
he 's raced in a number of hobby motorcycling events this year and done well - until the race in france .
but having gotten a bit more intimately acquainted with the tar in bresse than he probably would have liked , he might want to consider a set of training wheels while he gets the hang of the two-wheel thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

striker kevin kuranyi was in danger of again being dropped from the german national squad .
but then he put four goals past cottbus . the 2006 world cup was fun for all in germany - but not for kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker was dropped from the german national squad shortly before the start of the tournament and ended up watching the event from home . it looked as though the same fate might befall him in the run-up to the 2008 european championships .
former schalke coach mirko slomka benched him for a league match early this month against rostock and took him out of a tight game against barcelona in the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the striker has been back in national dress for germany 's past few friendlies but kuranyi sealed a trip to the euro 2008 with a four-goal barrage against cottbus on tuesday , april 15 . " if nothing unforeseen happens , kevin will be at euro 2008 , " germany coach loew said in an interview with the koelner express newspaper on thursday . you have to go back to october 2004 to find a player scoring four times in a league match .
in the space of 90 minutes , kuranyi went from the middle of the pack to the upper ranks of the bundesliga 's scoring list - and achieved a bit of personal redemption . long recovery from despair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has had to bear a lot of frustration the past two years as recently as last year , kuranyi was still bitter about what he called " the biggest disappointment of my year " - former germany coach juergen klinsmann 's decision to leave him off of the world cup squad . after learning he was out , kuranyi vented his feelings online in a blog entry . " i 'm truly speechless , " the striker wrote .
" i 'm deeply disappointed and know i am in for some sleepless nights .
i keep asking myself : why me ?
why ca n't i be part of this once-in-a-lifetime event ? " kuranyi vowed to come back , but he has suffered from comparisons to his competition for places in germany 's attack .
kuranyi , critics said , was neither as efficient with his chances nor as skilled with the soccer ball as bayern 's miroslav klose or stuttgart 's mario gomez . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but before euro 2008 , kuranyi hopes schalke can qualify internationally kuranyi 's four-goal barrage may have come against a small club having a very off night .
but his second goal in particular - a 29-meter blast after a bit of nifty dribbling - showed that an in-form kuranyi can create - and convert - opportunities . and with klose having only scored once in the second half of the season , ironically against schalke on march 1 , kuranyi could make a case that he belong in germany 's starting 11 .
after all he has 14 goals overall - to klose 's 10 . there 's little chance that loew will take the harsh step of benching klose , who 's been a first-team stalwart for germany for years . but kuranyi can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that loew will now find it just as hard to leave him off the squad for euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everybody is complaining about a film they have not seen , " director connie walther told the magazine .
" how could they have formed a fair opinion ? " ethical message aside , reviews on thursday were largely positive .
the film was broadly praised for its unflinching depiction of stasi cruelty and skilled acting , while the daily tageszeitung said it represented a new stage in germans ' collective coming to terms with the country 's communist-era division . " after reunification , the way of looking at the stasi was initially hysterical , " the paper said .
" but the 2007 oscar-winner ' the lives of others ' marked a watershed as it dared to give the stasi a human face . " mendacious movies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main character in " the lives of others " was dismissed by many as unrealistic but to others , humanizing the stasi was precisely what made florian henckel von donnersmarck 's critically acclaimed thriller mendacious and misleading . as the movie scooped every prize going , former civil rights activist werner schulz wrote in the online version of die welt newspaper that it failed to reflect the harsh reality of life in communist east germany . " a stasi officer prepared to risk his life to save a dissident never existed , " he said , although he conceded that the film accurately captured the drab atmosphere of life behind the iron curtain . comedies such as the smash hit " goodbye lenin " and " nva " about the east german army , he pointed out , suggested that " the most serious problem in the gdr was that you might die of laughter . " however , claudia michelsen , who played the lead in " 12 means i love you , " herself grew up in communist east germany and said the film made her rethink a lot of stereotypes . " i always had this image that this is a stasi spy and he is an idiot and this is a victim and deserves pity , " she said .
" but everybody has his own story and the man in this one simply did not know any better . " i think we should be more sensitive about individual destinies , " she added .

" " the president has made a disappointing speech that does not match up to the global challenge , " gabriel said thursday , april 17 , in reference to bush 's announcement a day priop on us emissions policy . in his speech , bush called for the growth in us greenhouse gas emissions to be stopped by 2025 " and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance . " bush said this were " realistic goals , " whereas " the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy . " the us president 's words marked a backward step from the united nations climate conference held in bali in december , where the us delegation made a last-minute decision to support a final summit document after previously opposing it , gabriel said . a need for caps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is n't leading as far as gabriel is concerned the german environment minister criticized bush 's refusal to back legislation to cap greenhouse-gas emissions . " without binding upper limits and reductions targets for the industrialized countries , climate change will not be stopped , " gabriel said .
" europe and the us must take the lead if others are to follow . " instead , with his proposals , the president is limping hopelessly behind , " he added .
" we are glad that there are other voices in the us . " stepping backwards the environment minister noted that the third meeting of the 16 so-called major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- -lrb- formerly major emitters meeting -rrb- was taking place in paris on thursday and friday , and said bush 's speech ran the risk of undermining a process initiated by the us itself . mem aims to draw together the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- countries with major developing economies , such as china , india and brazil , to combat climate change .
together , the 16 countries account for some 80 percent of world greenhouse-gas emissions . bush proposed the initiative ahead of the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june last year as a counterproposal to the kyoto protocol and mem was launched in september . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.04.2008 opinion : no reason for recession talk in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's leading economic research institutes on thursday , april 17 , published their outlook for the coming year .
according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german exports to us hit by slowing american economy flagging economic growth in the us and the strong euro have dented german exports to the us , germany 's biggest export partner outside europe , the federal statistics office reported this week .

according to dw 's karl zawadzky , there 's no reason to get pessimistic . the title of the spring report of germany 's leading economic research institutes hits the nail on the head : " consequences of us real estate crisis dampen economic cycle . " that 's it .
and it could n't be any other way .
when the world 's largest economy slides into recession as a result of crises in the real-estate and banking sectors , it puts a damper on europe and , especially , the german economy , which is integrated into the global market like no other . a drop in private consumption and investment in the us hurt german exports even if only eight percent of them are headed for america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky on top of that , german banks also irresponsibly participated in reckless ventures with american subprime mortgages and now have to deal with enormous write-offs .
billions and billions of dollars and euros have been destroyed by bank managers who often did n't even understand what they were doing when they were buying american subprime mortgage packages . now the money 's missing as a lubricant for the real economy .
the consequences of the financial market crisis are far from having been dealt with .
banks are still mainly concerned with themselves , which is why economic institutes are counting on further economic downturns for the coming year .
there 's reason to believe that they 're not wrong . apart from the us recession and the crisis of the financial markets , three major risks are threatening the economic cycle : a strong euro , high oil prices and inflation , the latter having risen to 3.6 percent in the euro zone . that 's put the european central bank between a rock and hard place .
while it should counter the economic downturn with interest rate cuts , inflation can only be dealt with via higher interest rates .
since both can not happen at the same time , the bank has voiced concerns , but failed to act . the strong euro makes it more difficult to export goods to the dollar zone .
but at the same time , it means that rising import prices for crude oil and natural gas , which are paid for in dollars , will be cushioned once converted into euros and wo n't hit consumers that hard . still , dampened growth expectations are starting to get to companies and consumers .
actually , there 's no reason to drop the optimism about the economic outlook and start looking at the world through pessimistic glasses .
the german economy keeps growing , even if significantly slower - at 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.4 percent in 2009 - than during the previous two years . there 's no reason to talk about recession , either .
germany 's exports keep breaking records and carry the economy .
companies that cut their costs , modernized production and internationalized distribution and service during the last economic downturn are now reaping the benefits of these measures . production has reached full capacity in many firms in such a way that a slight increase in orders can no longer be dealt with via overtime , but leads to new hires . during the late 1990s , economic growth had to reach 2.5 percent to create new jobs - now , anything above 1 percent will lead to new positions despite ongoing streamlining . it means that the unemployment rate will keep dropping .
on average , less than three million people could be out of work next year . this should encourage politicians to support employment with further reforms .
unfortunately , the opposite is happening : faced with a general election next year , the government and political parties are rapidly losing their reform fervor . on top of the financial market crisis , the strong euro , the high oil price and inflation , the paused political reform is turning into a fifth risk for the economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the ministers failed to agree on a new attempt to ban the far-right npd . federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a european union initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees .
schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of eu interior ministers in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . "
no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept . the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , heribert rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make germany a magnet for refugees . berlin interior minister erhart koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.04.2008 modern art inspires bank employees , says head art buyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contemporary art keeps employees in touch with the present , said huette art cologne , which opened on wednesday , april 16 , is a prime stop for corporate art collectors with million-euro budgets .
the head of deutsche bank 's massive art collection explained why they buy top-notch office art . with over 53,000 individual pieces , deutsche bank has amassed one of the largest corporate art collections in the world .
its " art at work " initiative was started in 1979 .
dw-world.de spoke with friedhelm huette , global head of deutsche bank art , about which works the bank buys and why it 's important to hang modern art on office walls . dw-world.de : how do you decide which works of art to add to deutsche bank 's collection ? friedhelm huette : since we started collecting art , we have had clear criteria for deciding what to include .
the first is that we want to support young talent .
young means that the artists have already had two or three gallery exhibitions or an exhibit - artists who have already made a bit of progress in the art scene and developed their own position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes in the frame has to be suitable for an office the other point is making discoveries .
there may be artists to discover who have been active in the art scene for a long time but are n't well known or need to be rediscovered .
yesterday , for example , we bought works on paper by tony conrad at artcologne .
they 're from the 1970s and were n't known at all ; they 'd been hidden in a drawer since then and were on display for the very first time .
that is also a kind of discovery . we collect largely works on paper - that is , drawings , water colors , photography , collages .
that limits us to some extent .
our focus is also international .
we look to india , ukraine , brazil - the spectrum is wide . we inform ourselves at fairs like artcologne , read trade journals , visit studios , look through catalogues , and so on .
that way we can get an idea of which artists we want to take a look at .
but we are also open to surprises .
art fairs are always good for making discoveries . do you place greater emphasis on young , new artists , or on the established ones ? ninety percent of our works are from young artists . what kind of budget do you have to work with ? we do n't publish the budget for purchasing art .
but i can tell you that deutsche bank 's complete worldwide art budget - not just for purchases , that would give the wrong impression , but for all art-related activities like exhibitions , partnerships , personnnel , etc . - amounts to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.6 million -rrb- .
the works we buy generally cost between 500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 790 to 15,800 -rrb- each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank displays artwork in its branches all over the world corporate collections are known for avoiding controversial topics like sex , religion or violence .
how careful is deutsche bank about avoiding controversy ? those topics do n't necessarily have to be avoided completely .
it 's important to keep in mind that our collection isn ’ t kept in drawers , nor is it on display at exhibitions .
it appears at the work place - that ’ s the concept .
that 's a very important guideline .
nearly 80,000 employees work there and the art should be inspiring and sophisticated , but we do n't want to hurt any feelings . if , for example , a female employee works near a very tasteful nude and a male visitor asks her five times a day if it 's a portrait of her - we ca n't have that . also , things that are completely acceptable in european culture may not be appropriate in other parts of the world .
there are even major differences between europe and america ; what some consider harmless could be seen as politically incorrect elsewhere . can you give an example ? a japanese artist , miwa yanagi , did a photo series on elevator girls .
she multiplied them and they were sitting on the floor .
they were completely clothed .
but the works could n't be shown in tokyo because the employees were bothered by it , even though it did n't cause any problems here in europe . in the 30 years of collecting , we 've always said that very sexually explicit topics are not appropriate for the work place .
we could buy those kinds of works for the collection and put them on exhibit because they 're important pieces of art , but that will always be the exception because the idea is that we buy pieces to hang in offices and conference rooms .
that 's very different from a museum .
visiting a museum is a voluntary decision , but when people go to work , the art is there whether they want it or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art gives office workers a new perspective we want it to have a positive charisma and make the people think .
political and social topics are present - in works by -lsb- german artist joerg -rsb- immendorff or -lsb- south african artist william -rsb- kentridge , for example , who deal with germany 's past .
but making people personally uncomfortable can not be the point of a concept that is designed to make contemporary art accessible at the work place . the number of works that ca n't be considered at all is relatively small , though . what do you hope that the deutsche bank employees will gain from having art in their workplace ? two things .
first of all , that they take an interest in contemporary art .
we do n't leave them alone but offer numerous opportunities for them to learn more , through libraries , texts on the works , tours , or offsite tours in museums where they can see more works from the same artists . the second , which i mentioned before , is to bring up certain topics .
we believe that collecting and displaying contemporary work is particularly valuable in a company like ours that deals with people .
we have to respond to different situations and recognize and develop new ideas and we believe that contemporary art provides a particular opportunity to participate in the present - also through the foresight and seismology of the artists and contemporary art .
thoughts arise over future developments . contemporary art offers a special window to society , which people do n't always perceive while they 're inside the capsule of their everyday lives . does it work ? very much so .
the program is very successful .
branches worldwide participate voluntarily .
when a branch shows an interest in the art program , we develop a concept , but those who do n't want to can put up posters instead .
it 's not a requirement .
but the interest is very large , as is the employees ' interest in our informational programs about the art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedhelm huette is the global head of deutsche bank art to what extent is the art project a financial investment and to what extent does it represent a deeper commitment to the arts ? we 're making an investment in our employees by offering them something very special , for both the visual and intellectual work environments . so it 's not so much about the monetary value of the artwork ? no , not at all .
we invest in our employees and in society by supporting young and promising artists .
there 's a risk involved , because there 's no guarantee that the artists will be successful .
but we are convinced that what they put on paper is an interesting artistic statement that 's worth drawing attention to , regardless of whether or not it makes the artist famous or not . what do you expect from this year 's artcologne ? it should be better than last year because fewer galleries are represented .
i think my colleagues and i all agree that it should be reduced even more and that more galleries should be cut . interview : kate bowen , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world : merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable dw-world : as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight dw-world : germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals dw-world : german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 17.04.2008 illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested outside the brazilian embassy this week with tropical rainforests continuing to disappear at an alarming rate , the eu is partially to blame for importing illegally felled timber .
so what is brussels planning to do ? on monday , april 14 , greenpeace organized a demonstration outside the brazilian embassy in berlin to protest over-exploitation of tropical rainforests .
according to a recent greenpeace study , five hectares -lrb- 12.4 acres -rrb- of forest are destroyed in brazil per minute , with every hectare of forest burnt down releasing between 500 and 1100 tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
today , one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the destruction of the rainforests .
according to the world wildlife fund , areas the size of 30 football pitches are disappearing every minute .
the problem of illegal logging is particularly acute in indonesia , allegedly the world 's third largest producer of greenhouse gases .
once hailed as one of the best solutions to saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming , rising demand for palm oil has resulted in local companies burning woods and peat lands to make way for palm oil plantations which supply european markets .
the downside of the biodiesel boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palm oil plantation in aceh it 's a similar story in south america , spurred on by the biodiesel boom in europe and the eu 's controversial 2003 biofuels directive , which requires all member states to have 5.75 percent of transportation run by biofuel in 2010 .
" this leads to further destruction of the rainforests , " argues celia harvey from conservation international .
earlier this month , german environment minister sigmar gabriel scrapped government plans to raise compulsory bioethanol blending levels in fossil gasoline , citing the fact that the bioethanol used for blending in germany was imported largely from third-world countries where deforestation may have taken place to expand farmland .
less well-documented is the destruction of scandinavia 's forests , where logging is generally legal .
the world bank , however , estimates that approximately 50 percent of worldwide logging is illegal , while a recent report by friends of the earth also asserted that " half of the timber imported by the eu from high-risk areas -lsb- including central africa , the amazon , russia and indonesia -rsb- has been logged illegally . " changing the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say increased demand for agricultural products has prompted farmers to raze rainforest land for fields and pastures with the eu being the biggest importer , environmental groups are calling on brussels to introduce a tropical rainforest conservation law .
" european governments have to ensure that only legally sourced timber and timber from sustainable forestry reaches the markets , " said corinna hölzel from greenpeace .
in 2006 , both the social democrats and the christian democrats rejected a draft german law to protect the rainforests , on the grounds that it was too complicated and that eu legislation would be preferable .
but studies on the eu 's environment policies conducted at the free university in berlin show that effective legislation is only ever implemented when governments have the courage of their convictions and take the initiative .
" german politicians pay a lot of service to the principle that rainforest conservation is the best climate protection , " says johannes zahnen from the world wildlife fund .
switzerland , britain and the us , meanwhile , are already planning new legislation on timber trading .
eu takes action in march , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas announced that the commission will be proposing new measures to tackle illegal logging this may , amid fears that the current eu legislation is not effective enough .
a friends of the earth report recently alleged that illegally logged timber was used in a number of eu-funded construction projects , while the commission has admitted that 1000 square meters of illegally imported timber from indonesia was even used in the renovation of its headquarters in brussels .
commissioner dimas has now agreed that the illegal timber issue is " very important because it contributes to deforestation , which is detrimental for both climate change and biodiversity " - issues which the eu executive is " determined to fight . "
he said the eu executive had concluded voluntary agreements with malaysia , indonesia , cameroon and ghana , adding that discussions were underway to conclude similar accords with other countries . certification schemes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most consumers do n't ask where their furniture wood comes from these latest moves come in the wake of a voluntary licensing scheme for timber imports into the eu , designed to combat illegal timber felling first introduced in 2005 and inviting timber exporting countries to produce export licenses stating that their products were legally harvested .
but johannes zahnen says that much more needs to happen .
importers should be able to confirm that the material they purchase comes from a legal source with the help of certification and independent verification .
this system already applies to foodstuffs , he points out , so why should n't it apply to wood ?
consumers are generally oblivious to where their garden chairs have come from , and according to zahnen , most of the low-cost furniture sold in europe is made of illegally logged wood .
making the fight harder than it already is moreover , existing certifications are not always reliable .
the label pefc -lrb- program for the endorsement of forest certification schemes -rrb- , for example , is highly controversial .
it allegedly fails to include crucial environmental protections , including protection for old-growth forests , wilderness and other endangered forests .
it allows labeled products to contain non-certified content from most controversial sources , and it fails to require independent verification of wood products ' origins .
wwf and greenpeace recommend instead the stringent certification issued by the forest stewardship council .
the fsc , which is the world 's leading forest certification system , ensures that forests meet a set of globally applicable , independent , performance-based standards for ecologically , socially , and economically responsible forestry .
in may , at the 9th ordinary meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in bonn , the topic of illegal logging is set to top the agenda .
if no new efforts to combat the destruction of the rainforests are agreed upon , the fight to stop climate change will become even harder than it already is . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

senator clinton criticised her rival 's recent remark that working-class voters clung to guns and religion in difficult times , calling it " offensive " .
senator obama said the comments had been taken out of context .
both expressed confidence that either of them could beat republican john mccain in november 's election .
but both declined to confirm whether they would ask the other to be their vice-presidential running mate .
recent gaffes asked whether mr obama could win the presidential election , mrs clinton said emphatically : " yes , yes , yes . "
mr obama , asked the same question about mrs clinton 's electability , responded : " absolutely and i 've said so before . "
both rivals criticised john mccain 's economic plans , pledging not to raise taxes on those earning less than $ 200,000 a year .
the candidates ' 21st debate since the beginning of the campaign came days before 158 crucial delegates will be up for grabs in pennsylvania .
the 90-minute debate in philadelphia gave the candidates a chance to make their case to pennsylvania 's democratic voters .
but if barack obama had hoped this debate would concentrate on policy , he was disappointed , says the bbc 's jamie coomarasamy in philadelphia .
the first 45 minutes focused on recent gaffes , our correspondent says .
under fire mr obama said he mangled his description of the mood in economically struggling small towns .
" the problem that we have in our politics , which is fairly typical , is that you take one person 's statement , if it 's not properly phrased , and you just beat it to death , and that 's what senator clinton 's been doing , " said the illinois senator .
for her part , mrs clinton apologised for the first time for inaccurately saying she came under sniper fire in bosnia in 1996 .
critics said she had exaggerated the dangerousness of the situation .
in another recent embarrassment , mrs clinton 's chief strategist , mark penn , was forced to resign after it emerged that he had attended a meeting with colombian officials to promote a us trade pact with the country .
mrs clinton has publicly opposed the policy .
since the democratic hopefuls last faced-off in a debate seven weeks ago , mr obama has come in for more criticism other than the row over his comments about small-town americans .
he has also faced calls to distance himself from jeremiah wright , the pastor of his church , after clips of mr wright 's fiery sermons were shown on the internet .
because of the proportional system the democrats use to distribute delegates , neither candidate will emerge from the pennsylvania primary with much of an advantage over the other .
the latest count of pledged delegates to the party 's national convention in august , according to the associated press , gives mr obama the support of 1,638 delegates and mrs clinton 1,502 .

yasna provoste had already been suspended by the lower house of parliament , and she lost an upper house motion of confidence by one vote .
she is accused of failing to account for the disappearance of millions of dollars of school subsidies .
the move marks a new low for president michelle bachelet government .
ms provoste , 38 , is the first chilean minister to be impeached for 36 years , and it comes as ms bachelet 's approval ratings continue to slump .
as a young , female minister with indigenous roots , ms provoste represented exactly the kind of face the president wanted to promote when her centre-left government took office two years ago , the bbc 's gideon long in santiago says .
but a probe by official auditors found that subsidies had been paid to school which overstated the number of pupils they had enrolled .
about $ 580m was involved .
president bachelet 's government defended ms provoste , putting any financial discrepancies down to accounting mistakes , and saying pressure for her removal was politically motivated .
but the government was beaten in the senate by the votes of a handful of rebels who had recently defected , giving the opposition a parliamentary majority .
the worry for mrs bachelet is that the rebels will do the same in future votes , making her a lame duck president for her remaining two years in power , our correspondent says .

thousands of pounds have been taken between 19 august 2006 and 23 february 2008 from motorists parking in a diplomatic space which had expired .
the space in windsor street outside the consulate general of ukraine had been covered by a temporary traffic order .
a motorist towed illegally from the spot is urging drivers to claim .
during the 18 month period , 12 cars were impounded with a £ 135 recovery cost and a further 68 vehicles were issued with a £ 60 parking ticket , which was reduced to £ 30 if it was paid within 14 days .
there were a further 27 cancelled tickets .
a two-year traffic order was obtained on 19 august 2004 for the parking spot but wardens continued issuing tickets despite it not being renewed . "
i would urge any motorist who has been wrongly fined for parking in this spot to request their money back from the council " angry motorist a 43-year-old motorist , who wished to remain anonymous , said he was " angry and upset " when he found his car had " vanished " .
he said : " the whole street is full of residents parking bays and being a permit holder i therefore parked in the street .
" i thought my car had been stolen when i returned .
i am always so careful over where i park that i wanted to make sure i was definitely in the wrong so i requested a copy of the road traffic order and that 's when i discovered i had been unlawfully towed away .
" following a freedom of information request , i was angry and annoyed to discover that there were dozens of other motorists who had been fined or towed since the space had expired .
" i would urge any motorist who has been wrongly fined for parking in this spot to request their money back from the council . "
permanent slot an edinburgh city council spokesman said although motorists could not appeal after they had paid a fine , drivers who had parked in the expired diplomatic space could contact them .
he said : " the space for the consulate was clearly marked and signed , so any motorists who parked in it will have been aware that they should n't have been there .
" those who have paid any penalties and not appealed any notice are assumed to have accepted that it was served correctly .
" however , drivers have the right to appeal if they feel that they did not deserve a ticket , and there is a fair and consistent system in place which deals with these occasions . "
the space has since been granted a permanent diplomatic slot by the scottish government , which means motorists can be fined for parking in the spot .

the space in windsor street outside the consulate general of ukraine had been covered by a temporary traffic order .
a motorist towed illegally from the spot is urging drivers to claim .
during the 18 month period , 12 cars were impounded with a £ 135 recovery cost and a further 68 vehicles were issued with a £ 60 parking ticket , which was reduced to £ 30 if it was paid within 14 days .
there were a further 27 cancelled tickets .
a two-year traffic order was obtained on 19 august 2004 for the parking spot but wardens continued issuing tickets despite it not being renewed .

" those who have paid any penalties and not appealed any notice are assumed to have accepted that it was served correctly .
" however , drivers have the right to appeal if they feel that they did not deserve a ticket , and there is a fair and consistent system in place which deals with these occasions . "
the space has since been granted a permanent diplomatic slot by the scottish government , which means motorists can be fined for parking in the spot .

on thursday , the german pontiff is due to celebrate mass for 45,000 people at a new washington baseball stadium .
on wednesday morning , thousands of guests welcomed the pope , who was 81 on wednesday , to his first white house meeting with president george w bush .

charities are calling for action to prevent vulnerable teenagers falling through the care net .
there is particular concern for so-called looked after children between the ages of 16 and 21 .
a spokesman for the department for children and families said the children and young person 's bill would give more support for children leaving care .
the uk has more children than any other western european country locked up - about 3,000 compared to fewer than 400 in italy .
there are no government records for approximately 4,500 children - about 8 % of the total 60,000 children in the care system .
two-fifths of children in care achieve no gcses and only a fifth obtains five or more .
children based in the midlands interviewed for the bbc 's today programme complained that they were abandoned once they reached 16 .
they allege that they were removed from foster care or children ’ s homes and placed in private rented accommodation .
one 17-year-old girl said : " i found it really hard coming out of care .
children in care 3,000 children locked up compared to fewer than 400 in italy two-fifths of children in care achieve no gcses only a fifth obtains five or more gcses " from being looked after , so if you run off you always have someone to come and pick you up -lsb- to a situation when they -rsb- haven ’ t prepared you for the real world .
" they haven ’ t prepared you for life ’ s basic skills . "
other children recounted similar experiences of being abandoned to a life of petty crime , prostitution and drugs .

according to the howard league for penal reform , 46 % of children behind bars in youth custody have experienced the care system .
frances crook , the league ’ s director , told the bbc : " we are saying the prison system and the local authorities are not fulfilling their full obligations to look after children properly and there are perversely financial incentives for local authorities to encourage or allow their most difficult and challenging children to end up in prison because they then don ’ t have to pay for them .
the reality remains that for many young people ... they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them kathy evans , children 's society " these are children who should be looked after by the state properly but their needs are not being looked after . "
all too often , according to crook , there are no social workers at the prison gate to greet a child entitled to care on release .
the children ’ s society has particular concern for disabled children living away from home and unaccompanied refugee children .
kathy evans , the society ’ s director , said : " the situation has been changing .
" i think the government does recognise that to expect any 16-year-old - let alone one who has had a disrupted childhood in care - to live on their own and effectively to fend for themselves is really compounding problems .
" the reality remains that for many young people - unaccompanied children arriving at 15 and some young people who ’ ve only recently come into care at 15 or 16 - they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them . "
many childcare organisations point out that the state is removing children from hazardous situations at home and then effectively placing them in worse situations or conditions that are no better than they had experienced before being taken into care .
select committee the plight of looked after children after the age of 16 is currently the subject of an investigation by the select committee for children , schools and families .
the department for children , schools and families is currently steering new legislation through parliament aimed at improving care for children after 16 .
the government ’ s introduced 11 so-called right to be cared for pilot projects .
a spokesman said : " we want young people to be more actively involved in planning their transition to adulthood and ensure that they are effectively supported if needed beyond 21 .
" we know that the care system has not treated children in care in the way they deserve to be - that is why our children and young person ’ s bill is currently before parliament .
" the bill will secure more direct support for children in and leaving care . "

charities are calling for action to prevent vulnerable teenagers falling through the care net .
there is particular concern for so-called looked after children between the ages of 16 and 21 .
a spokesman for the department for children and families said the children and young person 's bill would give more support for children leaving care .
the uk has more children than any other western european country locked up - about 3,000 compared to fewer than 400 in italy .
there are no government records for approximately 4,500 children - about 8 % of the total 60,000 children in the care system .
two-fifths of children in care achieve no gcses and only a fifth obtains five or more .
children based in the midlands interviewed for the bbc 's today programme complained that they were abandoned once they reached 16 .

according to the howard league for penal reform , 46 % of children behind bars in youth custody have experienced the care system .
frances crook , the league ’ s director , told the bbc : " we are saying the prison system and the local authorities are not fulfilling their full obligations to look after children properly and there are perversely financial incentives for local authorities to encourage or allow their most difficult and challenging children to end up in prison because they then don ’ t have to pay for them .
the reality remains that for many young people ... they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them kathy evans , children 's society " these are children who should be looked after by the state properly but their needs are not being looked after . "
all too often , according to crook , there are no social workers at the prison gate to greet a child entitled to care on release .
the children ’ s society has particular concern for disabled children living away from home and unaccompanied refugee children .
kathy evans , the society ’ s director , said : " the situation has been changing .
" i think the government does recognise that to expect any 16-year-old - let alone one who has had a disrupted childhood in care - to live on their own and effectively to fend for themselves is really compounding problems .
" the reality remains that for many young people - unaccompanied children arriving at 15 and some young people who ’ ve only recently come into care at 15 or 16 - they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them . "
many childcare organisations point out that the state is removing children from hazardous situations at home and then effectively placing them in worse situations or conditions that are no better than they had experienced before being taken into care .
select committee the plight of looked after children after the age of 16 is currently the subject of an investigation by the select committee for children , schools and families .
the department for children , schools and families is currently steering new legislation through parliament aimed at improving care for children after 16 .
the government ’ s introduced 11 so-called right to be cared for pilot projects .
a spokesman said : " we want young people to be more actively involved in planning their transition to adulthood and ensure that they are effectively supported if needed beyond 21 .
" we know that the care system has not treated children in care in the way they deserve to be - that is why our children and young person ’ s bill is currently before parliament .
" the bill will secure more direct support for children in and leaving care . "

frances crook , the league ’ s director , told the bbc : " we are saying the prison system and the local authorities are not fulfilling their full obligations to look after children properly and there are perversely financial incentives for local authorities to encourage or allow their most difficult and challenging children to end up in prison because they then don ’ t have to pay for them .
the reality remains that for many young people ... they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them kathy evans , children 's society " these are children who should be looked after by the state properly but their needs are not being looked after . "
all too often , according to crook , there are no social workers at the prison gate to greet a child entitled to care on release .
the children ’ s society has particular concern for disabled children living away from home and unaccompanied refugee children .
kathy evans , the society ’ s director , said : " the situation has been changing .
" i think the government does recognise that to expect any 16-year-old - let alone one who has had a disrupted childhood in care - to live on their own and effectively to fend for themselves is really compounding problems .
" the reality remains that for many young people - unaccompanied children arriving at 15 and some young people who ’ ve only recently come into care at 15 or 16 - they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them . "
many childcare organisations point out that the state is removing children from hazardous situations at home and then effectively placing them in worse situations or conditions that are no better than they had experienced before being taken into care .
select committee the plight of looked after children after the age of 16 is currently the subject of an investigation by the select committee for children , schools and families .
the department for children , schools and families is currently steering new legislation through parliament aimed at improving care for children after 16 .
the government ’ s introduced 11 so-called right to be cared for pilot projects .
a spokesman said : " we want young people to be more actively involved in planning their transition to adulthood and ensure that they are effectively supported if needed beyond 21 .
" we know that the care system has not treated children in care in the way they deserve to be - that is why our children and young person ’ s bill is currently before parliament .
" the bill will secure more direct support for children in and leaving care . "

charities are calling for action to prevent vulnerable teenagers falling through the care net .
there is particular concern for so-called looked after children between the ages of 16 and 21 .
a spokesman for the department for children and families said the children and young person 's bill would give more support for children leaving care .
the uk has more children than any other western european country locked up - about 3,000 compared to fewer than 400 in italy .
there are no government records for approximately 4,500 children - about 8 % of the total 60,000 children in the care system .
two-fifths of children in care achieve no gcses and only a fifth obtains five or more .
children based in the midlands interviewed for the bbc 's today programme complained that they were abandoned once they reached 16 .
they allege that they were removed from foster care or children ’ s homes and placed in private rented accommodation .
one 17-year-old girl said : " i found it really hard coming out of care .
children in care 3,000 children locked up compared to fewer than 400 in italy two-fifths of children in care achieve no gcses only a fifth obtains five or more gcses " from being looked after , so if you run off you always have someone to come and pick you up -lsb- to a situation when they -rsb- haven ’ t prepared you for the real world .
" they haven ’ t prepared you for life ’ s basic skills . "
other children recounted similar experiences of being abandoned to a life of petty crime , prostitution and drugs .

according to the howard league for penal reform , 46 % of children behind bars in youth custody have experienced the care system .
frances crook , the league ’ s director , told the bbc : " we are saying the prison system and the local authorities are not fulfilling their full obligations to look after children properly and there are perversely financial incentives for local authorities to encourage or allow their most difficult and challenging children to end up in prison because they then don ’ t have to pay for them .
the reality remains that for many young people ... they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them kathy evans , children 's society " these are children who should be looked after by the state properly but their needs are not being looked after . "
all too often , according to crook , there are no social workers at the prison gate to greet a child entitled to care on release .
the children ’ s society has particular concern for disabled children living away from home and unaccompanied refugee children .
kathy evans , the society ’ s director , said : " the situation has been changing .
" i think the government does recognise that to expect any 16-year-old - let alone one who has had a disrupted childhood in care - to live on their own and effectively to fend for themselves is really compounding problems .
" the reality remains that for many young people - unaccompanied children arriving at 15 and some young people who ’ ve only recently come into care at 15 or 16 - they do face life on their own , unsupported in what can be very vulnerable and threatening environments for them . "
many childcare organisations point out that the state is removing children from hazardous situations at home and then effectively placing them in worse situations or conditions that are no better than they had experienced before being taken into care .
select committee the plight of looked after children after the age of 16 is currently the subject of an investigation by the select committee for children , schools and families .
the department for children , schools and families is currently steering new legislation through parliament aimed at improving care for children after 16 .
the government ’ s introduced 11 so-called right to be cared for pilot projects .
a spokesman said : " we want young people to be more actively involved in planning their transition to adulthood and ensure that they are effectively supported if needed beyond 21 .
" we know that the care system has not treated children in care in the way they deserve to be - that is why our children and young person ’ s bill is currently before parliament .
" the bill will secure more direct support for children in and leaving care . "

the script plan to release their debut album in august having cut their teeth in los angeles working with the likes of rodney jerkins and the neptunes , though , it is unlikely this trio of twentysomething dubliners have westlife or the reformed boyzone in their sights .
having travelled the uk supporting the hoosiers , glen power -lrb- drums and acoustic guitar -rrb- , mark sheehan -lrb- guitar and vocals -rrb- and danny o 'donaghue -lrb- keyboards and lead vocals -rrb- are now targeting the charts with their catchy debut track we cry -lrb- out 28 april -rrb- .
it has not been plain sailing for the threesome , however .
o 'donaghue suffered a collapsed lung in january , while power took a tumble in november that left him with a fractured skull .
so how exactly did your respective mishaps occur ?
glen power : i went into my local pub , went to the toilet and literally woke up in hospital - i 'd slipped and banged my head on the sink .
i 'd fractured my skull and had to have a blood clot removed .
i was really lucky , though : i could have had a stroke .
danny o 'donaghue : i woke up one morning and felt this heavy feeling from the inside .
i laid down but the pain did n't subside , so i went to my local gp .
he rushed me into the er room and within an hour i 'd gone through surgery .
my lungs are my money-makers so it was quite a scary thing to happen .
is that why your debut single is called we cry ?
o 'donaghue and sheehan grew up in the james street area of dublin mark sheehan : no , we do n't write songs in 10 minutes !
a song takes nurturing ; it 's an evolving thing .
there is a whole lifetime in our songs .
d o 'd : there is not a lot of hope in the song .
but out of all the things that have gone wrong in our lives , the message is " together we cry " .
as long as we 're here together we can find a way to share the burden .
things seem to be going right now , though .
for those yet to hear your music , how would you describe your sound ?
ms : coming from ireland you naturally have one ear on england and the other on america - you 're between those two worlds .
the great british songbook has amazing lyrics , while america tends to be more beat- and groove-driven .
it 's the mix of the two that gives us our sound .
d o 'd : there are so many people who are going on itunes now to mix and match songs from lots of different genres .
why is n't there a band that can do the same thing ?
you have to be rock or hip-hop or pop .
that 's what excites us about the script .
ms : it 's okay to jump genres sometimes and experiment , as long as you stay loyal to your song and the core emotion is being hit .
so where do you see yourselves in five years ' time ?
the irish threesome cite u2 as one of their biggest inspirations d o 'd : you 've always got to be ambitious ; we 'll take on anything people put in front of us .
making music and playing every day is the only thing that 's going to satisfy this band .
ms : i love the reaction we 're getting from our live show , so i can only hope and dream that in five years ' time we 'll be a stadium act .
what , like u2 ?
they must have been a huge inspiration .
ms : they 've definitely been ambassadors for irish music .
they 've got to the top , and they 're still making history .
gp : when i was in school i used to look at them and say , " i want to do that . "
d o 'd : they showed the impossible could become possible .
the script can be heard on bbc radio 2 's music club on 19 april at 2000 bst .
the band were speaking to bbc news entertainment reporter neil smith .

o 'donaghue and sheehan grew up in the james street area of dublin mark sheehan : no , we do n't write songs in 10 minutes !
a song takes nurturing ; it 's an evolving thing .
there is a whole lifetime in our songs .
d o 'd : there is not a lot of hope in the song .
but out of all the things that have gone wrong in our lives , the message is " together we cry " .
as long as we 're here together we can find a way to share the burden .
things seem to be going right now , though .
for those yet to hear your music , how would you describe your sound ?
ms : coming from ireland you naturally have one ear on england and the other on america - you 're between those two worlds .
the great british songbook has amazing lyrics , while america tends to be more beat- and groove-driven .
it 's the mix of the two that gives us our sound .
d o 'd : there are so many people who are going on itunes now to mix and match songs from lots of different genres .
why is n't there a band that can do the same thing ?
you have to be rock or hip-hop or pop .
that 's what excites us about the script .
ms : it 's okay to jump genres sometimes and experiment , as long as you stay loyal to your song and the core emotion is being hit .
so where do you see yourselves in five years ' time ?
the irish threesome cite u2 as one of their biggest inspirations d o 'd : you 've always got to be ambitious ; we 'll take on anything people put in front of us .
making music and playing every day is the only thing that 's going to satisfy this band .
ms : i love the reaction we 're getting from our live show , so i can only hope and dream that in five years ' time we 'll be a stadium act .
what , like u2 ?
they must have been a huge inspiration .
ms : they 've definitely been ambassadors for irish music .
they 've got to the top , and they 're still making history .
gp : when i was in school i used to look at them and say , " i want to do that . "
d o 'd : they showed the impossible could become possible .
the script can be heard on bbc radio 2 's music club on 19 april at 2000 bst .
the band were speaking to bbc news entertainment reporter neil smith .

her debut album spirit shot to the top spot three weeks after her power ballad bleeding love went to number one in the us singles rundown .
spirit sold 205,000 copies in its first week , according to billboard magazine .
that was ahead of her nearest rival , george strait , whose troubadour sold 59,000 copies .
lewis has been billed as the heir to whitney houston in the us .
the last british woman to top the us album chart was sade with promise in 1986 .
x factor judge and lewis ' manager simon cowell said : " what leona has achieved is simply incredible .
this is the hardest market to crack and for her debut album to go in at number one is unbelievable . "
" leona lewis will not be an overnight sensation - she is the real deal " clive davis j records boss lewis shot to fame after winning the uk 's x factor talent show at the end of 2006 .
when spirit was released in the uk last november , it broke the arctic monkeys ' record to become the fastest-selling debut album in chart history , shifting 375,000 copies in its first week .
the singer was nominated for four brit awards earlier this year , including best british female and best british album - but lost out on all of them .
that prompted cowell to dismiss the awards as " too sarcastic " for " sneering " at an artist because they emerged on a tv show .
' impressed ' lewis was signed in the us by j records boss clive davis , who launched the careers of whitney houston , alicia keys and justin timberlake .
he recently told the los angeles times : " the tv aspect is irrelevant .
i was impressed with -lsb- leona -rsb- in the same way whitney houston or alicia keys auditioned for me . "
responding to the album 's success on wednesday , davis said : " leona lewis will not be an overnight sensation .
she is the real deal and this is just the beginning of a long and illustrious career . "
lewis has joined a growing list of british female singers who have enjoyed success in the us , including amy winehouse , natasha bedingfield , lily allen and corinne bailey rae .
duffy , estelle and adele are among the next hit british artists due to launch their albums across the atlantic .
