german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.03.2008 opinion : merkel could have taken it further in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on her visit to israel , german chancellor angela merkel could have addressed more " difficult " issues , says dw 's peter philipp .
what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days nearly every purchase comes with a special bonus - like free fries with your burger or 20 percent more in the shampoo bottle .
one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?
kids are growing up faster and faster these days . police admitted they were puzzled over the circumstances surrounding the oddly located weapon .
they searched the home of the 39-year-old seller , who was n't able to offer any clues to the case .
there was no word on whether his own kids were armed . the buggy , however , had been parked unused in the basement for three years .
it is most likely that someone secretly slipped the weapon into the pram pocket during that time - either a dangerous offender looking for an innocent way to dispose of the crime weapon , or perhaps it was the seller 's three-year-old son . dw staff with dpa wire reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days nearly every purchase comes with a special bonus - like free fries with your burger or 20 percent more in the shampoo bottle .
one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?
kids are growing up faster and faster these days . police admitted they were puzzled over the circumstances surrounding the oddly located weapon .
they searched the home of the 39-year-old seller , who was n't able to offer any clues to the case .
there was no word on whether his own kids were armed . the buggy , however , had been parked unused in the basement for three years .
it is most likely that someone secretly slipped the weapon into the pram pocket during that time - either a dangerous offender looking for an innocent way to dispose of the crime weapon , or perhaps it was the seller 's three-year-old son . dw staff with dpa wire reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 19.03.2008 germany to open center remembering wartime expulsions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wooden cart used by refugees displayed at an exhibition in bonn in 2005 chancellor merkel 's government gave the go-ahead on wednesday , march 19 , for a controversial documentation center in berlin recalling the expulsions of millions of germans from central europe after world war ii . the center , to be built in berlin at a cost of around 30 million euros -lrb- $ 46 million -rrb- is intended as a " visible symbol against flight and expulsions , " according to the government .
it will be located near berlin 's famous potsdamer platz and will be part of the german history museum . a permanent exhibition about an estimated 12 million to 14 million germans forced out of their homes by polish and czech governments in reprisal for nazi aggression will form the centerpiece of the project . in addition , the center will also document forced expulsions of other peoples in europe and the fate of refugees until the present day . reservations in warsaw , prague more than 60 years after the end of world war ii , the project is intended to foster reconciliation while keeping alive the memory of those who suffered as a result of expulsion . the center was originally proposed by the league of expellees , which represents around 2 million germans forced out of central europe , and their descendents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans evicted from poland arriving in germany after the end of world war ii but efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be a major irritant in germany 's relationship with poland and the czech republic .
both feared the center would give too much attention to estimated 1 million germans who died during the exodus and paper over germany 's responsibility for the war . warsaw has accused germany of wanting to turn aggressors into victims . german officials , however , have said that the center would clearly distinguish the historic context and causes of the expulsions .
germany 's secretary of state for cultural affairs , bernd neumann said the center would " adequately document " nazi crimes committed across europe . he added that the center would be a step forward in dealing with a " painful part of german and european history . " " preventing misunderstanding " polish criticism of the plans for an expellee center was particularly strong during the conservative-nationalist reign of the kaczynski brothers .
but the election of liberal polish prime minister donald tusk last year has largely defused the tensions . last month , poland dropped its long-standing objections to the documentation , following a meeting in warsaw between wladyslaw bartoszewski , a high-ranking advisor to tusk and neumann . in the meeting , both sides " stressed the importance of open historical dialog for polish-german relations and the need to seek forms that will aid historical truth and prevent misunderstanding . " for germans , the goal of the memorial is " to represent the historical relationship while at the same time taking the deportation of the polish people into account , " neumann added . the german government foresees involving historians from poland , hungary and the czech republic in the project . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .

the law which went into effect in january gave the federal government broad access to data including e-mail addresses , length of call and numbers dialed and in the case of mobile phones , the location calls are made from .
fears of data misuse the court in karlsruhe on wednesday declared that parts of the law were unconstitutional pending review .
it ruled that the data may continue to be stored by telecom companies but that details may only be transferred to investigators in the event of inquires into serious crime and only with a warrant .
in cases of less serious crime , investigating authorities may only access the data subject to a final decision by the top court , judges said .
the legislation is part of an eu directive formulated in response to bomb attacks in madrid and london in past years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in hamburg staged a mock funeral marking the " death of privacy " it has sparked large protests by german civil liberties campaigners , privacy advocates and opposition politicians in recent months who argue it would make huge amounts of personal data vulnerable to misuse and place everybody under general suspicion of being a terrorist .
critics are also concerned that the data may be handed over to foreign intelligence agencies and could be used by entertainment companies to pursue and prosecute people who illegally download music and videos .
on dec 31 , over 30,000 opponents of the law filed a class-action suit , the biggest of its kind in germany , against the bill .

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .

the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .
" the international community should not turn a blind eye to the corners the georgian authorities may have cut and should be rigorous in reviewing georgia 's commitments , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .
" the international community should not turn a blind eye to the corners the georgian authorities may have cut and should be rigorous in reviewing georgia 's commitments , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .
" the international community should not turn a blind eye to the corners the georgian authorities may have cut and should be rigorous in reviewing georgia 's commitments , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will be located near berlin 's famous potsdamer platz and will be part of the german history museum . a permanent exhibition about an estimated 12 million to 14 million germans forced out of their homes by polish and czech governments in reprisal for nazi aggression will form the centerpiece of the project . in addition , the center will also document forced expulsions of other peoples in europe and the fate of refugees until the present day . reservations in warsaw , prague more than 60 years after the end of world war ii , the project is intended to foster reconciliation while keeping alive the memory of those who suffered as a result of expulsion . the center was originally proposed by the league of expellees , which represents around 2 million germans forced out of central europe , and their descendents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans evicted from poland arriving in germany after the end of world war ii but efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be a major irritant in germany 's relationship with poland and the czech republic .
both feared the center would give too much attention to estimated 1 million germans who died during the exodus and paper over germany 's responsibility for the war . warsaw has accused germany of wanting to turn aggressors into victims . german officials , however , have said that the center would clearly distinguish the historic context and causes of the expulsions .
germany 's secretary of state for cultural affairs , bernd neumann said the center would " adequately document " nazi crimes committed across europe . he added that the center would be a step forward in dealing with a " painful part of german and european history . " " preventing misunderstanding " polish criticism of the plans for an expellee center was particularly strong during the conservative-nationalist reign of the kaczynski brothers .
but the election of liberal polish prime minister donald tusk last year has largely defused the tensions . last month , poland dropped its long-standing objections to the documentation , following a meeting in warsaw between wladyslaw bartoszewski , a high-ranking advisor to tusk and neumann . in the meeting , both sides " stressed the importance of open historical dialog for polish-german relations and the need to seek forms that will aid historical truth and prevent misunderstanding . " for germans , the goal of the memorial is " to represent the historical relationship while at the same time taking the deportation of the polish people into account , " neumann added . the german government foresees involving historians from poland , hungary and the czech republic in the project . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days nearly every purchase comes with a special bonus - like free fries with your burger or 20 percent more in the shampoo bottle .
one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?

the law which went into effect in january gave the federal government broad access to data including e-mail addresses , length of call and numbers dialed and in the case of mobile phones , the location calls are made from .
fears of data misuse the court in karlsruhe on wednesday declared that parts of the law were unconstitutional pending review .
it ruled that the data may continue to be stored by telecom companies but that details may only be transferred to investigators in the event of inquires into serious crime and only with a warrant .
in cases of less serious crime , investigating authorities may only access the data subject to a final decision by the top court , judges said .
the legislation is part of an eu directive formulated in response to bomb attacks in madrid and london in past years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in hamburg staged a mock funeral marking the " death of privacy " it has sparked large protests by german civil liberties campaigners , privacy advocates and opposition politicians in recent months who argue it would make huge amounts of personal data vulnerable to misuse and place everybody under general suspicion of being a terrorist .
critics are also concerned that the data may be handed over to foreign intelligence agencies and could be used by entertainment companies to pursue and prosecute people who illegally download music and videos .
on dec 31 , over 30,000 opponents of the law filed a class-action suit , the biggest of its kind in germany , against the bill .
" a serious blow to the government " wednesday 's decision was the latest in a series of rulings against tighter security measures by chancellor angela merkel 's government .
last month , the constitutional court established a new " fundamental right " for german citizens to surveillance-free computer systems .
in recent years , the court has set limits on bugging homes , trawling electronic databases and monitoring computers of suspected criminals .
the decision was hailed by opposition politicians and privacy advocates .
" the grand coalition should finally draw the lesson of these verdicts and stop crossing the limits of constitutionality on citizen rights , " said claudia roth of the opposition greens party .
" this is a serious blow to the federal justice ministry which until recently has been trying to play down the violation of basic rights of citizens by the data collection bill , " said joerg van essen from the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?
kids are growing up faster and faster these days . police admitted they were puzzled over the circumstances surrounding the oddly located weapon .
they searched the home of the 39-year-old seller , who was n't able to offer any clues to the case .
there was no word on whether his own kids were armed . the buggy , however , had been parked unused in the basement for three years .
it is most likely that someone secretly slipped the weapon into the pram pocket during that time - either a dangerous offender looking for an innocent way to dispose of the crime weapon , or perhaps it was the seller 's three-year-old son . dw staff with dpa wire reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're waiting for the informant to make contact again , " she said . there had been no discussion about payment or a possible delivery , she said . the stuttgarter zeitung said estimates show that germans may have stashed up to 170 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- in switzerland , which is considered by many to be a tax haven . liechtenstein scandal still fresh bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and liechtenstein have been tied up in a tax scandal since february germans have already been reeling from a tax scandal focusing on liechtenstein .
in february , it was revealed that hundreds of germans had allegedly hidden away money there to avoid paying taxes in germany . the affair has spread to countries throughout europe and as far away as australia and new zealand . the revelations came about after an informant sold data to german secret services which detailed accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein . meanwhile , the uk 's financial times reported on wednesday , march 19 , that a second liechtenstein bank that has been rocked by the theft of sensitive customer data said it believed german tax officials would not gain access to clandestine customer accounts there . " we are convinced such a deal is not possible on legal grounds , " the british newspaper quoted josef fehr , chief executive of the liechtensteinische landesbank -lrb- llb -rrb- , as saying . the claim follows on the footsteps of reports that at least one of the four people arrested in germany for allegedly blackmailing the llb was trying to negotiate a milder sentence in exchange for information about germans holding secret accounts . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law which went into effect in january gave the federal government broad access to data including e-mail addresses , length of call and numbers dialed and in the case of mobile phones , the location calls are made from .
fears of data misuse the court in karlsruhe on wednesday declared that parts of the law were unconstitutional pending review .
it ruled that the data may continue to be stored by telecom companies but that details may only be transferred to investigators in the event of inquires into serious crime and only with a warrant .
in cases of less serious crime , investigating authorities may only access the data subject to a final decision by the top court , judges said .
the legislation is part of an eu directive formulated in response to bomb attacks in madrid and london in past years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in hamburg staged a mock funeral marking the " death of privacy " it has sparked large protests by german civil liberties campaigners , privacy advocates and opposition politicians in recent months who argue it would make huge amounts of personal data vulnerable to misuse and place everybody under general suspicion of being a terrorist .
critics are also concerned that the data may be handed over to foreign intelligence agencies and could be used by entertainment companies to pursue and prosecute people who illegally download music and videos .
on dec 31 , over 30,000 opponents of the law filed a class-action suit , the biggest of its kind in germany , against the bill .
" a serious blow to the government " wednesday 's decision was the latest in a series of rulings against tighter security measures by chancellor angela merkel 's government .
last month , the constitutional court established a new " fundamental right " for german citizens to surveillance-free computer systems .
in recent years , the court has set limits on bugging homes , trawling electronic databases and monitoring computers of suspected criminals .
the decision was hailed by opposition politicians and privacy advocates .
" the grand coalition should finally draw the lesson of these verdicts and stop crossing the limits of constitutionality on citizen rights , " said claudia roth of the opposition greens party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .

the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .

it will be located near berlin 's famous potsdamer platz and will be part of the german history museum . a permanent exhibition about an estimated 12 million to 14 million germans forced out of their homes by polish and czech governments in reprisal for nazi aggression will form the centerpiece of the project . in addition , the center will also document forced expulsions of other peoples in europe and the fate of refugees until the present day . reservations in warsaw , prague more than 60 years after the end of world war ii , the project is intended to foster reconciliation while keeping alive the memory of those who suffered as a result of expulsion . the center was originally proposed by the league of expellees , which represents around 2 million germans forced out of central europe , and their descendents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans evicted from poland arriving in germany after the end of world war ii but efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be a major irritant in germany 's relationship with poland and the czech republic .
both feared the center would give too much attention to estimated 1 million germans who died during the exodus and paper over germany 's responsibility for the war . warsaw has accused germany of wanting to turn aggressors into victims . german officials , however , have said that the center would clearly distinguish the historic context and causes of the expulsions .
germany 's secretary of state for cultural affairs , bernd neumann said the center would " adequately document " nazi crimes committed across europe . he added that the center would be a step forward in dealing with a " painful part of german and european history . " " preventing misunderstanding " polish criticism of the plans for an expellee center was particularly strong during the conservative-nationalist reign of the kaczynski brothers .
but the election of liberal polish prime minister donald tusk last year has largely defused the tensions . last month , poland dropped its long-standing objections to the documentation , following a meeting in warsaw between wladyslaw bartoszewski , a high-ranking advisor to tusk and neumann . in the meeting , both sides " stressed the importance of open historical dialog for polish-german relations and the need to seek forms that will aid historical truth and prevent misunderstanding . " for germans , the goal of the memorial is " to represent the historical relationship while at the same time taking the deportation of the polish people into account , " neumann added . the german government foresees involving historians from poland , hungary and the czech republic in the project . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said monday 's riots in the ethnically divided northern kosovo town of mitrovica had " crossed a red line with the deliberate intent to kill people - you know molotov cocktails , fragmentation grenades and direct fire " aimed at un and nato-led kfor forces .
town under de facto military law the violence was sparked by a un police operation to retake a un court seized three days earlier by protesting serbs .
after the police detained around 50 of the serbs , hundreds of residents from the serb-dominated town attacked the security force 's convoy and freed some of the prisoners .

un chief ban ki-moon deplored the violent attacks against un and nato-led forces and urged " all communities to exercise calm and restraint . "
he expected " all sides to refrain from any actions or statements that could incite or provoke further violence , " a statement from his office said .
russia , which remains serbia 's strongest ally in opposing kosovo independence , stuck to its guns in the aftermath of the rioting .
speaking at a joint moscow press conference with rice , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov reiterated russia 's opposition to kosovo 's independence .
kosovo serbs ' rights were being ignored and they felt like " strangers " in their own country , lavrov said .
russia insists a resolution of kosovo 's status can only come with the consent of both the serbian and kosovo governments .

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .
" the international community should not turn a blind eye to the corners the georgian authorities may have cut and should be rigorous in reviewing georgia 's commitments , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.03.2008 opinion : merkel could have taken it further in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on her visit to israel , german chancellor angela merkel could have addressed more " difficult " issues , says dw 's peter philipp .
what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said monday 's riots in the ethnically divided northern kosovo town of mitrovica had " crossed a red line with the deliberate intent to kill people - you know molotov cocktails , fragmentation grenades and direct fire " aimed at un and nato-led kfor forces .
town under de facto military law the violence was sparked by a un police operation to retake a un court seized three days earlier by protesting serbs .

" we are in the midst of a fierce struggle involving blood and fire , a life and death struggle with the dalai clique , " tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , told a teleconference of the region 's government and party leaders . " leaders of the whole country must deeply understand the arduousness , complexity and long-term nature of the struggle , " he said in remarks carried online by the china tibet news . the italian government on tuesday , march 18 , called on the european union to swiftly send a mission to beijing and " ask the chinese side for a satisfactory clarification of the situation in tibet as quickly as possible . " in a statement issued after a meeting between italian secretary of state gianni vernetti and chinese ambassador to rome , sun yuxi , italy urged the eu to dispatch a mission to discuss the situation with the chinese authorities and the " outlook for political dialogue in tibet . " dalai lama hints at resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blamed by china for the protests , the dalai lama said he would step down to end violence violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said . the government-in-exile of the dalai lama , tibet 's spiritual leader , say about a 100 people are believed to have died in clashes between tibetans and chinese authorities . beijing has blamed the dalai lama for the violence , saying he masterminded the protests .
the dalai lama , who has accused china of " cultural genocide " in tibet , consistently says he is not seeking independence for tibet but wants autonomy within china , which sent troops into the region in 1950 . on tuesday , the dalai lama said he was willing to step down as head of the tibetan government in exile if that was needed to stop the riots in his homeland . speaking on public radio , italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said on tuesday that the resignation of tibetan spiritual leader dalai lama would be a " very serious thing -lrb- that could -rrb- cause the situation in tibet to go completely out of control . " tibetans rally in europe amid protests across europe , hundreds of tibetans also rallied outside the european union 's headquarters in brussels on tuesday , urging the eu to investigate allegations of chinese repressions in their country .
at least one demonstrator was injured and four were detained when members of a 250-strong crowd of exiled tibetans tried to force their way into china 's mission to the european union , police said . " we want the eu to help us by sending an investigation team -lrb- to tibet -rrb- to verify the facts , " songtse , a belgium-based tibetan told news agency dpa . the protesters also called on the international community to stop the olympic torch being carried through tibet . eu governments and officials have so far turned down calls for the summer olympic games in beijing to be boycotted , arguing that such a boycott would not be the right answer . calls to boycott opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have called for an olympic boycott if violence in tibet does not end however french foreign minister bernard kouchner suggested tuesday the eu may consider a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics in protest over a crackdown on tibetan protests . media rights group reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- had on tuesday called for a boycott of the aug .
8 ceremony . kouchner told a press conference that rsf 's proposal " does not have the support of the french government " but suggested it could be discussed at a meeting of foreign ministers from the eu 's 27 member states next week in slovenia . " if there were to be a proposal , it could only be a european one , " he said , adding : " why not examine all of this " at the meeting . " let us consider it , " he said , arguing that staying away from the opening ceremony would be " less negative than a general boycott of the games , " which france and other european nations have ruled out . the view was echoed by hans-gert poettering , head of the european parliament and a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " what 's happening in tibet right now will never be accepted by us .
the chinese must recognize that , " poettering told german radio station deutschlandfunk . the christian democrat urged politicians to rethink their travel plans for the opening ceremony of the games in beijing , saying they had to ask themselves whether it was responsible to attend the event . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .

the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.03.2008 opinion : merkel could have taken it further in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on her visit to israel , german chancellor angela merkel could have addressed more " difficult " issues , says dw 's peter philipp .
what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days nearly every purchase comes with a special bonus - like free fries with your burger or 20 percent more in the shampoo bottle .
one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?
kids are growing up faster and faster these days . police admitted they were puzzled over the circumstances surrounding the oddly located weapon .
they searched the home of the 39-year-old seller , who was n't able to offer any clues to the case .
there was no word on whether his own kids were armed . the buggy , however , had been parked unused in the basement for three years .
it is most likely that someone secretly slipped the weapon into the pram pocket during that time - either a dangerous offender looking for an innocent way to dispose of the crime weapon , or perhaps it was the seller 's three-year-old son . dw staff with dpa wire reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .
" the international community should not turn a blind eye to the corners the georgian authorities may have cut and should be rigorous in reviewing georgia 's commitments , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .

while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2008 iraq war fatigue poses challenge for german peace movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after five years , no one knows how long foreign troops will remain in iraq after five years , carnage in iraq has become a sad part of our daily reality .
the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .

what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .

the law which went into effect in january gave the federal government broad access to data including e-mail addresses , length of call and numbers dialed and in the case of mobile phones , the location calls are made from .
fears of data misuse the court in karlsruhe on wednesday declared that parts of the law were unconstitutional pending review .
it ruled that the data may continue to be stored by telecom companies but that details may only be transferred to investigators in the event of inquires into serious crime and only with a warrant .
in cases of less serious crime , investigating authorities may only access the data subject to a final decision by the top court , judges said .
the legislation is part of an eu directive formulated in response to bomb attacks in madrid and london in past years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in hamburg staged a mock funeral marking the " death of privacy " it has sparked large protests by german civil liberties campaigners , privacy advocates and opposition politicians in recent months who argue it would make huge amounts of personal data vulnerable to misuse and place everybody under general suspicion of being a terrorist .
critics are also concerned that the data may be handed over to foreign intelligence agencies and could be used by entertainment companies to pursue and prosecute people who illegally download music and videos .
on dec 31 , over 30,000 opponents of the law filed a class-action suit , the biggest of its kind in germany , against the bill .
" a serious blow to the government " wednesday 's decision was the latest in a series of rulings against tighter security measures by chancellor angela merkel 's government .
last month , the constitutional court established a new " fundamental right " for german citizens to surveillance-free computer systems .
in recent years , the court has set limits on bugging homes , trawling electronic databases and monitoring computers of suspected criminals .
the decision was hailed by opposition politicians and privacy advocates .
" the grand coalition should finally draw the lesson of these verdicts and stop crossing the limits of constitutionality on citizen rights , " said claudia roth of the opposition greens party .
" this is a serious blow to the federal justice ministry which until recently has been trying to play down the violation of basic rights of citizens by the data collection bill , " said joerg van essen from the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .
georgia remains a young democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protestors took to the streets after the last elections yet concerns georgia 's readiness to join nato go beyond its problems in abkhazia .
pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .
this recent demonstrations and hunger strikes have worried some european countries .
there 's a sense among some european leaders that georgia needs to improve its democratic track record before it is ready to join nato .
the international crisis group has issued reports emphasizing georgia 's need to continue improving its democratic governance record , especially in terms of rule of law , property rights , judicial system and human rights .
the government in tbilisi needs to " ensure increased accountability and transparency in the implementation of reforms , and further pursue open and democratic governance and especially engage in a constructive dialogue with opposition parties , " frichova said .
" the international community should not turn a blind eye to the corners the georgian authorities may have cut and should be rigorous in reviewing georgia 's commitments , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president has promised to regain control of the territories but she points out that the conflicts are not as " frozen " as many would like to believe .
while both the georgian government and the separatist areas emphasize they want to solve the conflicts peacefully , small incidents in the zones of conflict frequently surface and threaten to combust .
" of serious concern is that a single incident could go slightly wrong .
it could then spiral out of control and lead to something much bigger , " frichova said .
the latest minor incident came tuesday when authorities in abkhazia claimed they shot down an unmanned georgian spy plane over the black sea .
georgia denied that it had sent a spy plane to the area .
" we have warned the georgian side many times and demanded they put an end to the reconnaissance flights " over abkhazia , sergei bagpsh , the leader of the breakaway region said .
while georgia wo n't rule out the need to use force , halbach said he does n't think russia or georgia want the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia to become violent .

pro-western georgian president mikhail saakashvili , who ushered in the so-called rose revolution in 2003 , has faced massive protests who claim his january 2008 re-election election was rigged .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion nato -pipe- 19.03.2008 abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's military does n't have control over abkhazia the aftershocks of kosovo 's split from serbia are being felt in georgia , where breakaway republics are loudly proclaiming their own independence .
the situation threatens to further destabilize the region . during soviet times , abkhazia 's black sea coast was a prime vacation destination for the soviet elite .
while some brave russian tourists still travel over the border , the breakaway georgian republic remains a no-go zone for the majority of the world .
and despite abkhazia 's recent calls for the world to recognize it 's independence , the region seems fated to remain locked in political limbo as europe and russia 's attempt to exert their influence over the caucasus .
the standoff between abkhazia and georgia has turned into a major headache for europe and russia .
there 's worries that violence could erupt in abkhazia or the small georgian breakaway republic of south ossetia which in turn could destabilize the entire region , much as kosovo has in the balkans .
nato membership remains contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia does not see the breakaway governments as legitimate georgia desperately wants to join nato and had hoped to be offered a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- at an important nato summit which will be held in early april in bucharest .
the map is the last hurdle georgia would need to overcome before gaining full membership to the western military alliance .
but with russian opposition strong and some european countries such as germany and france backing off their support , a fast track for georgia and ukraine looks unlikely , experts say .
the european union has said it supports georgia in the dispute with secessionists .
to a certain extent both russia and europe are using the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia as bargaining chips , said uwe halbach an expert in the caucasus and russia for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
russia recently withdrew from a 1996 agreement banning military , economic and official contacts with abkhazia and south ossetia a move which georgia complained will further destabilize the region .
yet halbach said he expects russia to stop short of fully recognizing the separatist regimes .
europe , worried about angering russia , also seemed likely to use georgia 's internal border conflicts as an excuse for stalling its nato membership , halbach said .
germany is one of the biggest georgia skeptics as it is particularly sensitive to russian criticism .
kosovo triggered independence claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't want to be part of georgia none of this political posturing between russia , europe and georgia has stopped abkhazia from calling on the international community to recognize its sovereignty .
it has done so numerous times since the ethnic abkhaz minority drove out the georgian army in 1992 .
the conflict , in which russia aided the rebels , resulted in some 250,000 ethnic georgians being forcibly expelled from the region .
abkhazia is often referred to as a " frozen conflict , " which means it 's in a standoff with no visible solution in sight .
abkhazia 's independence is recognized by no one , not even its long-time ally russia .
the region has its own government , educational system and all the other bells and whistles that normally come with statehood .
abkhazia 's calls for recognition have grown louder since kosovo 's declaration of independence in february .
many european countries and the united states supported kosovo independence , while claiming that it did not set a precedent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is accused of providing the rebels with weapons russia had strongly opposed kosovo breaking away from its ally , serbia .
russia officially opposes separatist movements , whether in tibet , kosovo or chechnya .
alexei ostrovsky , head of the parliamentary committee for ex-soviet affairs , said last week that it is time for russia to review this foreign policy in light of kosovo .
abkhazia , south ossetia and the moldovan rebel territory of transdnestr " have more arguments in favor of being recognized than kosovo had .
they have lived independently for more than 15 years , " ostrovsky said .
push and shove continues while kosovo has sharpened the arguments on both sides , magdalena frichova , the tbilisi-based caucasus project director for the international crisis group , said that does n't expect kosovo 's independence to cause a sudden surge of violence in georgia .

the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german peace movement is no longer able to mobilize huge protests .
instead they 're trying to suggest pragmatic , and global , solutions . after as many as one million war-related casualties , and up to four million displaced persons and refugees , iraq often seems no closer to peace than when the us launched initial air strikes on baghdad on march 20 , 2003 .
german anti-war organizations are marking the anniversary with protests - in heidelberg and mannheim , for instance , demonstrators are staging a 24-hour sit-in outside the nearby us army headquarters .
and the iraq war will feature in this weekend 's traditional peace marches around the country .
the majority of germans remain opposed to the us-led military campaign , and enthusiasm is waning in the us as well .
ironically , though , there 's also war fatigue among the peace activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casualty rates among civilians - and especially children - are appalling " people get used to everything , " manfred stenner , the head of the network of peace cooperatives , told dw-world .
" the outrage cools off , and the iraq war is one topic among many at the easter marches .
you ca n't always be in total alarm mode .
we have to accept that . "
joachim guilliard , a journalist and initiator of the group international people 's tribunal on the aggression against iraq , or iti , concurs .
" the media reports paint a false picture , " guilliard said .
" major insurgent attacks make the news , but you never get details about ongoing us military operations , which - without denying the problem of terrorism - cause the majority of the violence .
it is very difficult to mobilize people with this false picture . "
change in strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war activists throughout europe are holding rallies on the annivesary whereas the anti-war movement in the past tried to prevent the us-led invasion , then called for a more-or-less immediate withdrawal of coalition forces , today peace activists are focusing on exit strategies .
at a conference in berlin earlier this month , iti members sketched out what they thought was the way forward for ending the violence in iraq .
their idea is to institute a general ceasefire , have us troops withdraw to their bases and gradually be replaced by peacekeepers from neutral , preferably muslim countries , and then commence negotiations among all parties in the various conflicts .
guilliard admits the plan has weaknesses , particularly as to who would lead the potential peacekeepers , but he says it 's part of a new pragmatic approach to ending what 's become a dismal cycle of violence and retribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush declared major combat operations in iraq over on may 1 , 2003 " you ca n't withdraw all the troops from one day to the next , " guilliard said .
" but we need a reasonable , six-month plan .
it 's an idea that comes from the iraqi opposition . "
peace organizations are also trying to address what they see as the underlying material interests for the war - chiefly oil .
that involves working more closely with environmental activists .
" during the first gulf war of 1991 , our slogan was ' no blood for oil , ' and we 're trying to address the causes of war , " said stenner .
" in order to prevent future conflicts over oil reserves , we need to renounce using fossil fuels . "
" the iraq war is an attempt to secure oil fields , " guilliard said .
" instead of doing that , we should be trying to use less energy . "
positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

positive and negative visions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 53 people were killed , and 130 wounded , in a single bomb attack in baghdad earlier this month but few peace activists kid themselves that violence in iraq will be eradicated any time soon . they agree that strife would likely continue even if the us under a new president is persuaded to pull out of iraq .
" i have little hope for the next few years since with every month of the occupation the iraqi state continues to disintegrate into countless tiny parts , " guilliard said .
" i also do n't see a majority in washington .
even barack obama says he only wants to withdraw combat troops , not all us forces .
it will take at least three or four years until the americans are sick and tired of bearing the costs . "
the best hope for iraq , activists think , is for the various factions within the country to be given a chance to negotiate without outside interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 4000 us soldiers have died in iraq , and costs could reach $ 1.9 trillion " let the various groups within the populace find their own solutions , " stenner said .
" iraq is a very old civilization with reasonable people from all religious groups and ethnicities .
in any case that approach promises more success than the one we have now . "
and the consensus is that all the disputes in the middle east and the muslim world - whether they involve the wars in iraq and afghanistan , the controversy around iran 's possible nuclear program and its future role in the region , the israeli-palestinian conflict or fundamentalist terrorism - are connected .
" a compromise that took into account the interests of all concerned would remove the ground from under al qaeda 's feet , " stenner said .
" it 's sometimes easier to solve everything at once than to tackle every problem individually . "
this sort of holistic solution is unlikely to become reality any time in the immediate future , but there 's little peace activists in germany and elsewhere in the world can do other than to propose alternatives to a conflict that threatens to continue long beyond its already grim fifth anniversary . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days nearly every purchase comes with a special bonus - like free fries with your burger or 20 percent more in the shampoo bottle .
one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?
kids are growing up faster and faster these days . police admitted they were puzzled over the circumstances surrounding the oddly located weapon .
they searched the home of the 39-year-old seller , who was n't able to offer any clues to the case .
there was no word on whether his own kids were armed . the buggy , however , had been parked unused in the basement for three years .
it is most likely that someone secretly slipped the weapon into the pram pocket during that time - either a dangerous offender looking for an innocent way to dispose of the crime weapon , or perhaps it was the seller 's three-year-old son . dw staff with dpa wire reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in the midst of a fierce struggle involving blood and fire , a life and death struggle with the dalai clique , " tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , told a teleconference of the region 's government and party leaders . " leaders of the whole country must deeply understand the arduousness , complexity and long-term nature of the struggle , " he said in remarks carried online by the china tibet news . the italian government on tuesday , march 18 , called on the european union to swiftly send a mission to beijing and " ask the chinese side for a satisfactory clarification of the situation in tibet as quickly as possible . " in a statement issued after a meeting between italian secretary of state gianni vernetti and chinese ambassador to rome , sun yuxi , italy urged the eu to dispatch a mission to discuss the situation with the chinese authorities and the " outlook for political dialogue in tibet . " dalai lama hints at resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blamed by china for the protests , the dalai lama said he would step down to end violence violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said . the government-in-exile of the dalai lama , tibet 's spiritual leader , say about a 100 people are believed to have died in clashes between tibetans and chinese authorities . beijing has blamed the dalai lama for the violence , saying he masterminded the protests .
the dalai lama , who has accused china of " cultural genocide " in tibet , consistently says he is not seeking independence for tibet but wants autonomy within china , which sent troops into the region in 1950 . on tuesday , the dalai lama said he was willing to step down as head of the tibetan government in exile if that was needed to stop the riots in his homeland . speaking on public radio , italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said on tuesday that the resignation of tibetan spiritual leader dalai lama would be a " very serious thing -lrb- that could -rrb- cause the situation in tibet to go completely out of control . " tibetans rally in europe amid protests across europe , hundreds of tibetans also rallied outside the european union 's headquarters in brussels on tuesday , urging the eu to investigate allegations of chinese repressions in their country .
at least one demonstrator was injured and four were detained when members of a 250-strong crowd of exiled tibetans tried to force their way into china 's mission to the european union , police said . " we want the eu to help us by sending an investigation team -lrb- to tibet -rrb- to verify the facts , " songtse , a belgium-based tibetan told news agency dpa . the protesters also called on the international community to stop the olympic torch being carried through tibet . eu governments and officials have so far turned down calls for the summer olympic games in beijing to be boycotted , arguing that such a boycott would not be the right answer . calls to boycott opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have called for an olympic boycott if violence in tibet does not end however french foreign minister bernard kouchner suggested tuesday the eu may consider a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics in protest over a crackdown on tibetan protests . media rights group reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- had on tuesday called for a boycott of the aug .
8 ceremony . kouchner told a press conference that rsf 's proposal " does not have the support of the french government " but suggested it could be discussed at a meeting of foreign ministers from the eu 's 27 member states next week in slovenia . " if there were to be a proposal , it could only be a european one , " he said , adding : " why not examine all of this " at the meeting . " let us consider it , " he said , arguing that staying away from the opening ceremony would be " less negative than a general boycott of the games , " which france and other european nations have ruled out . the view was echoed by hans-gert poettering , head of the european parliament and a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " what 's happening in tibet right now will never be accepted by us .
the chinese must recognize that , " poettering told german radio station deutschlandfunk . the christian democrat urged politicians to rethink their travel plans for the opening ceremony of the games in beijing , saying they had to ask themselves whether it was responsible to attend the event . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.03.2008 opinion : merkel could have taken it further in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on her visit to israel , german chancellor angela merkel could have addressed more " difficult " issues , says dw 's peter philipp .
what the middle east needs most , he says , is encouragement to pursue peace . many years ago , yochanan meroz , who later became israel 's ambassador to germany in bonn , said that relations between the two countries were " very good , but not normal . "
at the time , german politicians made efforts to elicit the word " normal " from israelis - secretly hoping that attention could then be turned to daily business and that the past could be left behind . but politicians have long ago abandoned such attempts and no longer try to wrestle adjectives out of others .
instead , they practice what appeared unimaginable and impossible - even to the greatest optimists - when israel was founded 60 years ago and in many of the ensuring years : fostering deep ties and friendship . german chancellor angela merkel 's visit to israel has brought this characterization of mutual relations to a new level , and yet simultaneously punctuated what meroz formerly said : that relations are not " normal . "
normalcy in light of the systematic murder of jews by nazis is unthinkable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp that is why it is important that bilateral relations are further developed and improved .
but the question of whether one has gone overboard in pursuing a good thing can still be posed .
even the unusual arrangement of regular government consultations between the two countries can not mask the fact that germany 's relations with israel can not be viewed in isolation . true friends can offer criticism while the german government - as it existed in bonn until 1999 - tried to hide behind a barely existing european policy on the middle east , the berlin-based government has become a major player in international politics - including in the middle east .
this raises the question of whether it is appropriate to celebrate solidarity with israel with such exuberance , but so lacking in critique , or if it would n't be better , as a friend , to address truths which have long been accepted around the world - even among broad sections of the israeli population .
it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would have been appropriate to address the too harsh course of action in the gaza strip and the expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank in an open manner . is such criticism not permissible when one visits israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding ?
perhaps .
if it had n't been for the fact that merkel traveled to the country with nearly half of the german government for the political consultations between the two countries .
youth exchange programs , scientific , cultural and economic cooperation are certainly significant matters to discuss .
however , one should be more cautious in the approaching weeks and months when it comes to military cooperation . but what israel , the palestinians and the middle east really need is peace .
they also require encouragement to pursue policies which promote peace , as well as criticism of all that runs counter to it .
and there is still plenty of that in the region . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kueng was born on march 19 , 1928 , in the swiss canton of lucerne and was ordained as a priest at the age of 26 in basel . he is a colleague of pope benedict xvi and , as a professor of theology in tubingen , kueng has been an outspoken critic of the catholic church since the 1970s .
after questioning the infallibility of the pope and calling for an internal reformation of the catholic church , his permission to teach was revoked by the vatican in 1979 . it was n't until after the death of former pope john paul ii that kueng was allowed to enter the halls of the vatican once again . though kueng and the current pope share a common background , their theological views differ greatly .
while kueng has focused on inter-religious dialogue , pope benedict places priority on tradition and the unity of the catholic church .
nevertheless , the two maintain regular communication . click on the links below to read dw-world.de 's past interviews with hans kueng and related stories on the catholic church . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- dw-world.de interviews with hans kueng " christianity gets on many people 's nerves " for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers in bremen based their findings on new , unique satellite data . for the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from germany 's bremen university announced on tuesday , march 18 . the highest concentration of human-generated co2 can be found in western germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " atmospheric chemistry and physics discussion . "
the region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of germany 's coal and steel sectors . " we 're certain that the raised co2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this european urban area are very stabile , " said researcher michael buchwitz from the institute for environmental physics at the university of bremen . carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
the main source of co2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas . unique measuring instrument it can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric co2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , buchwitz said .
since there are already large amounts of co2 in the air - 3,000 billions tons globally - even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas . furthermore , co2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
in the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter . the research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
the measuring device , sciamachy -lrb- scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography -rrb- , was built by the german aerospace center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 . it is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect co2 levels close to the earth 's surface .
sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection . the study was based on data collected from sciamachy over a three-year period . bildunterschrift : researchers said the concentration patterns clearly show human influence dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days nearly every purchase comes with a special bonus - like free fries with your burger or 20 percent more in the shampoo bottle .
one german couple got a bonus with their buggy that they were n't expecting . a couple of freshly baked parents got quite a shock this week when they discovered a gun while cleaning the second-hand stroller they 'd bought in an online auction . the nine-millimeter pistol was not a plastic toy model .
it was loaded with non-baby-proof bullets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stick ' em up , buster !
was this some street gang 's way of looking for new blood , or a well-intended special giveaway from a rather deranged online vendor ?
kids are growing up faster and faster these days . police admitted they were puzzled over the circumstances surrounding the oddly located weapon .
they searched the home of the 39-year-old seller , who was n't able to offer any clues to the case .
there was no word on whether his own kids were armed . the buggy , however , had been parked unused in the basement for three years .
it is most likely that someone secretly slipped the weapon into the pram pocket during that time - either a dangerous offender looking for an innocent way to dispose of the crime weapon , or perhaps it was the seller 's three-year-old son . dw staff with dpa wire reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

until now , diamonds from botswana have been sent abroad to be polished , marketed and sold .
the $ 83m plant , jointly owned by the government and diamond giant de beers , will become a processing centre for diamonds from de beers mines worldwide .
botswana is the world 's largest producer of diamonds and one of africa 's most stable countries .
the presence of the new advanced diamond sorting facility in the capital , gaborone , is expected to create further jobs in the finance , security and telecommunications sectors .
vast pit diamonds are a finite resource , but they still make up 80 % of botswana 's foreign earnings . "
we have seen a lot of opportunities being created ... on the back of the discovery of this great operation " balisi bonyongo general manager , jwaneng mine for quarter of a century , diamonds have been dug from jwaneng mine - the richest diamond mine in the world .
jwaneng means " the place of small stones " .
its vast open pit yields the bedrock of botswana 's economy , and looks to do so for decades to come , guaranteeing continued growth .
the mine 's general manager , balisi bonyongo , argues that development in botswana " really took off " when jwaneng mine was discovered , and when it started operating in 1982 .
" we have seen wealth creation in this country , " he said .
" we have seen a lot of opportunities being created , for employment , for infrastructure , hospitals , health services - on the back of the discovery of this great operation - jwaneng mine . "
previously , mined diamonds were exported straight to london to be processed .
but with the rough gems now being sorted at the diamond trading company , the production process will be centred in botswana .
that will eventually benefit thousands of local workers .
long-term investment de beers , which has been operating in botswana for more half a century , says it makes economic sense to move the technology and skills to the country .
botswana 's reputation as a stable country is attractive to investors , argue the firm 's management .
" mining is a long term investment , " said sheila khama , chief executive officer of de beers botswana .
" and one of the pre-requisites to investing in mining , is political and economic stability ... of the country in which the investor puts their money .
" botswana 's successful beneficiation ensures botswana 's economic stability . "
ms khama accepts that concerns remain about the finite nature of the diamond industry .
" we know diamonds are a finite resource and over 50 years , we spent $ 93m in botswana searching for diamonds , " she said .
" we need to find other deposits . "
stiff competition delphinah kehathilwe , a local diamond sorter , knew nothing about diamonds before she underwent six months of training .
" they say diamonds are a lady 's friend , but before i did n't see much in a diamond .
but touching them on a daily basis , i began to like them , " she said .
cutting and polishing facilities are also being moved to africa , with 16 different manufacturers agreeing to start operations in the country .
while this diversification will face stiff competition from the traditional centres in china and india , the developments are important ones for botswana .
the transfer of skills from abroad should put the country on the map as never before , and change the face of its diamond industry .

until now , diamonds from botswana have been sent abroad to be polished , marketed and sold .
the $ 83m plant , jointly owned by the government and diamond giant de beers , will become a processing centre for diamonds from de beers mines worldwide .
botswana is the world 's largest producer of diamonds and one of africa 's most stable countries .
the presence of the new advanced diamond sorting facility in the capital , gaborone , is expected to create further jobs in the finance , security and telecommunications sectors .
vast pit diamonds are a finite resource , but they still make up 80 % of botswana 's foreign earnings .
we have seen a lot of opportunities being created ... on the back of the discovery of this great operation balisi bonyongo general manager , jwaneng mine for quarter of a century , diamonds have been dug from jwaneng mine - the richest diamond mine in the world .
jwaneng means " the place of small stones " .
its vast open pit yields the bedrock of botswana 's economy , and looks to do so for decades to come , guaranteeing continued growth .
the mine 's general manager , balisi bonyongo , argues that development in botswana " really took off " when jwaneng mine was discovered , and when it started operating in 1982 .
" we have seen wealth creation in this country , " he said .
" we have seen a lot of opportunities being created , for employment , for infrastructure , hospitals , health services - on the back of the discovery of this great operation - jwaneng mine . "
previously , mined diamonds were exported straight to london to be processed .
but with the rough gems now being sorted at the diamond trading company , the production process will be centred in botswana .
that will eventually benefit thousands of local workers .
long-term investment de beers , which has been operating in botswana for more half a century , says it makes economic sense to move the technology and skills to the country .
the diamond trading company will create 3,000 jobs botswana 's reputation as a stable country is attractive to investors , argue the firm 's management .
" mining is a long term investment , " said sheila khama , chief executive officer of de beers botswana .
" and one of the pre-requisites to investing in mining , is political and economic stability ... of the country in which the investor puts their money .
" botswana 's successful beneficiation ensures botswana 's economic stability . "
ms khama accepts that concerns remain about the finite nature of the diamond industry .
" we know diamonds are a finite resource and over 50 years , we spent $ 93m in botswana searching for diamonds , " she said .
" we need to find other deposits . "
stiff competition delphinah kehathilwe , a local diamond sorter , knew nothing about diamonds before she underwent six months of training .
jwaneng 's vast open pit has yielded diamonds for 25 years " they say diamonds are a lady 's friend , but before i did n't see much in a diamond .
but touching them on a daily basis , i began to like them , " she said .
cutting and polishing facilities are also being moved to africa , with 16 different manufacturers agreeing to start operations in the country .
while this diversification will face stiff competition from the traditional centres in china and india , the developments are important ones for botswana .
the transfer of skills from abroad should put the country on the map as never before , and change the face of its diamond industry .

the université de montréal monitored 40 suspected sleepwalkers during normal sleep , and then during rest which followed a long period of wakefulness .
the annals of neurology study found the number of incidents of disturbed sleep , including sleepwalking , rose sharply during " recovery " sleep .
it is estimated sleepwalking , which has been linked to aggressive and injurious behaviour , affects up to 4 % people . "
more and more adults are suffering from sleepwalking and it may be due to the fact that we are increasingly a tired , sleep deprived 24/7 society " dr neil stanley sleep expert sleep deprivation has been linked to sleepwalking in previous research - but the findings have been inconclusive .
the latest study focused on patients referred to a sleep disorder clinic for suspected sleepwalking between august 2003 and march 2007 .
following examination , the patients slept for a night in the lab .
the next day they went about their regular daytime activities , after which they returned to the lab in the evening , where they were constantly supervised to ensure they did not fall asleep .
recovery sleep took place the next morning , following 25 hours of wakefulness .
videotaped all patients were videotaped during each sleep period and the researchers evaluated behavioural movements on a three-point scale of complexity , ranging from playing with the bed sheets to getting up from the bed .
during normal sleep half of the patients showed signs of disturbance , but during " recovery " sleep the figure rose to 90 % .
the total number of episodes of " behavioural movement " recorded by the researchers rose from 32 in normal sleep to 92 in " recovery " sleep .
sleep deprivation also significantly increased the proportion of sleepwalkers experiencing at least one complex episode .
sleepwalking is thought to occur during the phases of deep sleep .
the current study found that sleep deprivation increased the problems that patients experienced in moving out of deep sleep into other phases of sleep .
' not trivial ' deep sleep , associated with a slow down of electrical activity in the brain , is believed to be critical to the restoration of mood and the ability to learn , think and remember .
dr neil stanley , a sleep expert at norfolk and norwich university hospital , said although most people thought of sleepwalking as a trivial problem , it could have serious consequences for sufferers .
he said there were instances of people suffering serious injury while sleepwalking , and of sleepwalkers committing murder .
he said : " this study shows we need to get a good night 's sleep every night .
" it was thought that sleepwalking was mainly a childhood problem , which we grew out of .
" but it seems more and more adults are suffering from sleepwalking and it may be due to the fact that we are increasingly a tired , sleep deprived 24/7 society . "

the next day they went about their regular daytime activities , after which they returned to the lab in the evening , where they were constantly supervised to ensure they did not fall asleep .
recovery sleep took place the next morning , following 25 hours of wakefulness .
videotaped all patients were videotaped during each sleep period and the researchers evaluated behavioural movements on a three-point scale of complexity , ranging from playing with the bed sheets to getting up from the bed .
during normal sleep half of the patients showed signs of disturbance , but during " recovery " sleep the figure rose to 90 % .
the total number of episodes of " behavioural movement " recorded by the researchers rose from 32 in normal sleep to 92 in " recovery " sleep .
sleep deprivation also significantly increased the proportion of sleepwalkers experiencing at least one complex episode .
sleepwalking is thought to occur during the phases of deep sleep .
the current study found that sleep deprivation increased the problems that patients experienced in moving out of deep sleep into other phases of sleep .
' not trivial ' deep sleep , associated with a slow down of electrical activity in the brain , is believed to be critical to the restoration of mood and the ability to learn , think and remember .
dr neil stanley , a sleep expert at norfolk and norwich university hospital , said although most people thought of sleepwalking as a trivial problem , it could have serious consequences for sufferers .
he said there were instances of people suffering serious injury while sleepwalking , and of sleepwalkers committing murder .
he said : " this study shows we need to get a good night 's sleep every night .
" it was thought that sleepwalking was mainly a childhood problem , which we grew out of .
" but it seems more and more adults are suffering from sleepwalking and it may be due to the fact that we are increasingly a tired , sleep deprived 24/7 society . "

swiss-based financier langston corporation wants the high court to make a summary judgement against the fa cup semi-finalists .
but the club 's lawyers have argued that the dispute should go to a full trial .
cardiff 's former chairman sam hammam has been named by the club 's barrister as the man behind langston .
following the two-day hearing last week , mr justice briggs said he would take time to consider his ruling .
it is expected later on wednesday ' uncertain future ' langston wants £ 24m of a total £ 31m in loans to be repaid immediately .
however , the club claim the loan is not repayable until 2016 and it could face an uncertain future if it lost the case .
the judge is to decide whether the club have a strong enough defence to go to trial , or he could rule in langston 's favour without the need for a full trial .
at the start of the hearing , langston 's counsel , michael driscoll qc had said : " it is common ground that the claimant loaned £ 24m to the club in 2004 and is yet to be repaid .
" the club says that nothing is to be repaid at this time , and the question is whether there is enough in what the club says to justify this case going to trial .
" the claimant says that there is nothing in what the club has said . "
the club said that a variation to the loan agreement in 2006 meant the loan was not repayable until 2016 .
however , langston claimed in court that so many changes had been made to the contract that this agreement no longer stood .
the ruling comes at a crucial time for the championship club , who face barnsley in the fa cup semi-final at wembley on 6 april .
chairman peter ridsdale , who succeeded mr hammam , has said administration would be a realistic scenario if the club lost the case .
that would lead to an automatic 10-point deduction which would threaten the club with relegation and affect plans for a new stadium near their ninian park ground .

they are the icons of broad town , a huge factory campus owned by middle-aged businessman zhang yue .
the pyramid and the palace , rather incongruous in china 's heartland , are reminders that mr zhang is a bit different from the average chinese industrialist .
he is chief executive of privately held broad air conditioning , and has made his fortune on green technology - and a code of ethics .
at a time when chinese bosses are blamed for their shoddy business practices , mr zhang is pledging to protect the environment , respect intellectual property , end price gouging and even to pay taxes .
he has been running his company , selling to more than 40 countries , for two decades .
' paying the price ' these days , he has bigger problems on his mind , chiefly the sorry state of china 's environment .
there has been so much damage done to the environment , and a lot of that damage is permanent zhang yue " i think the main problem with the chinese economy is that growth has been so crude , " he says over lunch at his mediterranean club on campus .
" our resources , our environment are paying the price for it .
our benefit in terms of higher living standards are only a small part of the big picture .
" there has been so much damage done to the environment , and a lot of that damage is permanent . "
mr zhang is a self-made businessman , formerly an art teacher .
he is worth hundreds of millions of dollars , and behaves like an emperor at broad town .
the 49 year-old downs red wine at lunch , over the protests of his wife .
everyday he sports the same dark jacket and trousers outfit that all his employees wear .
' influence people ' the buildings at broad town may look like slightly tasteless bling , but to mr zhang , they symbolise the lofty aspirations he holds for his company and employees .
mr zhang wants china to be more concerned about the environment " i want to influence people with what i say , " mr zhang says between swigs of wine .
" tell people to be more creative , innovative and careful when they build or make something , especially when it comes to understanding the environmental consequences . "
broad town , with its expansive gardens and orderly factories , is a physical manifestation of his business and life philosophy .
around the french palace stand about three dozen bronze statues of key figures from history : socrates , winston churchill , napoleon , confucius , and even martin luther king jr , his hands raised as if to conduct an orchestra .
mr zhang says they are there to offer stony-faced moral leadership .
big boys ' toys broad says it makes the only non-electric air conditioners in the world .
they have already saved the planet 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the company .
china 's pollution has worsened alongside its fast economic growth instead of using electricity , these non-electric coolers use natural gas .
as well as lecturing chinese bosses , mr zhang likes to show them how to live the good life .
he has stretch limos and ferraris , but he prefers big boys ' toys .

senator obama said he understood the history of anger between black and white americans but that the us could not afford to ignore race issues .
he referred to the uproar over what he called the rev jeremiah wright 's " profoundly distorted view " of the us .
mr wright said the 9/11 attacks were like " chickens coming home to roost " .
after the remarks resurfaced , mr obama denounced them as " incendiary " and " completely inexcusable " and said he had not been present when they were made .
mr obama is locked in a close race with new york senator hillary clinton for the democratic nomination , with the significant pennsylvania primary vote due on 22 april .
the bbc 's jamie coomarasamy in philadelphia says this was a bold speech with considerable risks , but one which barack obama clearly felt he had little choice but to make to defuse the race issue .
' racial stalemate ' speaking in philadelphia , the pennsylvania city seen as the cradle of us democracy , mr obama referred to america 's long history of racial inequality - and called on the us to move beyond it .
i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community barack obama " the anger is real ; it is powerful ; and to simply wish it away , to condemn it without understanding its roots , only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races , " he said .
as the child of a black father and white mother , he said he understood the passions of both sides in what he called " a racial stalemate we 've been stuck in for years " - and said he was not so naive as to believe it could be overcome in one election cycle .
however , mr obama said , he believed the nation could - if it worked together - move towards healing some of the wounds caused by racial injustice .
obama speech in full barack obama : a more perfect union -lsb- 55kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here and while he condemned many of mr wright 's political views as " not only wrong but divisive " , he pointed out that the pastor had grown up at a time of racial segregation .
" i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community .
i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother , " he said .
he recalled that his grandmother had raised him and loved him - but that at times she had used racially-tinged language or stereotypes that made him " cringe " .
' do n't walk away ' mr obama also said that it should not be surprising to americans that anger over racial injustice still finds voice in many black churches .
the row was sparked by sermons given by the rev jeremiah wright he challenged the nation not to ignore the issue of race " this time " - while acknowledging that white americans , especially the working class , also had their problems .
" if we walk away now , if we simply retreat into our respective corners , we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care , or education , or the need to find good jobs for every american . "
race has emerged as an issue on several occasions in the battle between mr obama and hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination , but at no time before has mr obama addressed it so directly .
former president bill clinton was accused of stirring up racial tensions over remarks he made after mr obama 's victory in south carolina 's primary in january , in which he seemed to try to marginalise mr obama as a black candidate winning a state with a heavily black electorate .
in an interview with us network abc broadcast on monday , mr clinton rejected that criticism , saying it was a " myth " that the clinton campaign had engaged in racial politics .
last week , former vice-presidential nominee geraldine ferraro resigned from her unpaid advisory post to the clinton campaign after a row over remarks appearing to suggest mr obama had only got where he was because of his race .
mccain 's travels mrs clinton , also campaigning in philadelphia on tuesday , told reporters she had not seen mr obama 's speech .
but , she added : " these are difficult issues and we have seen that in this campaign .
race and gender are difficult issues .
and therefore we need to have more discussion about them . "
while the democratic hopefuls competed in pennsylvania , john mccain - the presumptive republican nominee - visited jordan and israel , a day after meeting us and iraqi officials in iraq .
he told reporters that visiting iraq - his eighth such trip - made it " palpably clear what a mistake it would be if the united states precipitously withdrew our forces " .
in israel , he visited the national holocaust memorial , yad vashem .
before arriving , he said pursuing the israeli-palestinian peace process was a " high priority " .
' ' god damn america ' mr wright has resigned from an honorary position on the campaign 's african-american religious leadership committee , aides to mr obama said .
before his retirement from trinity united church of christ , in chicago , the pastor helped mr obama affirm his christian faith , officiated at his wedding and baptised his daughters .
mr obama said he had looked to mr wright for spiritual , not political , guidance .
in a sermon on the sunday after the attacks of 11 september 2001 , mr wright suggested that the us had brought the terror attacks on itself through its own foreign policy .
and in a 2003 sermon , he said blacks should condemn the us because of continuing racial injustice , saying : " god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human . "

senator obama said he understood the history of anger between black and white americans but that the us could not afford to ignore race issues .
he referred to the uproar over what he called the rev jeremiah wright 's " profoundly distorted view " of the us .
mr wright said the 9/11 attacks were like " chickens coming home to roost " .
after the remarks resurfaced , mr obama denounced them as " incendiary " and " completely inexcusable " and said he had not been present when they were made .
mr obama is locked in a close race with new york senator hillary clinton for the democratic nomination , with the significant pennsylvania primary vote due on 22 april .
the bbc 's jamie coomarasamy in philadelphia says this was a bold speech with considerable risks , but one which barack obama clearly felt he had little choice but to make to defuse the race issue .
' racial stalemate ' speaking in philadelphia , the pennsylvania city seen as the cradle of us democracy , mr obama referred to america 's long history of racial inequality - and called on the us to move beyond it .
i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community barack obama " the anger is real ; it is powerful ; and to simply wish it away , to condemn it without understanding its roots , only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races , " he said .
as the child of a black father and white mother , he said he understood the passions of both sides in what he called " a racial stalemate we 've been stuck in for years " - and said he was not so naive as to believe it could be overcome in one election cycle .
however , mr obama said , he believed the nation could - if it worked together - move towards healing some of the wounds caused by racial injustice .

" i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community .
i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother , " he said .
he recalled that his grandmother had raised him and loved him - but that at times she had used racially-tinged language or stereotypes that made him " cringe " .
' do n't walk away ' mr obama also said that it should not be surprising to americans that anger over racial injustice still finds voice in many black churches .
the row was sparked by sermons given by the rev jeremiah wright he challenged the nation not to ignore the issue of race " this time " - while acknowledging that white americans , especially the working class , also had their problems .
" if we walk away now , if we simply retreat into our respective corners , we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care , or education , or the need to find good jobs for every american . "
race has emerged as an issue on several occasions in the battle between mr obama and hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination , but at no time before has mr obama addressed it so directly .
former president bill clinton was accused of stirring up racial tensions over remarks he made after mr obama 's victory in south carolina 's primary in january , in which he seemed to try to marginalise mr obama as a black candidate winning a state with a heavily black electorate .
in an interview with us network abc broadcast on monday , mr clinton rejected that criticism , saying it was a " myth " that the clinton campaign had engaged in racial politics .
last week , former vice-presidential nominee geraldine ferraro resigned from her unpaid advisory post to the clinton campaign after a row over remarks appearing to suggest mr obama had only got where he was because of his race .
mccain 's travels mrs clinton , also campaigning in philadelphia on tuesday , told reporters she had not seen mr obama 's speech .
but , she added : " these are difficult issues and we have seen that in this campaign .
race and gender are difficult issues .
and therefore we need to have more discussion about them . "
while the democratic hopefuls competed in pennsylvania , john mccain - the presumptive republican nominee - visited jordan and israel , a day after meeting us and iraqi officials in iraq .
he told reporters that visiting iraq - his eighth such trip - made it " palpably clear what a mistake it would be if the united states precipitously withdrew our forces " .
in israel , he visited the national holocaust memorial , yad vashem .
before arriving , he said pursuing the israeli-palestinian peace process was a " high priority " .
' ' god damn america ' mr wright has resigned from an honorary position on the campaign 's african-american religious leadership committee , aides to mr obama said .
before his retirement from trinity united church of christ , in chicago , the pastor helped mr obama affirm his christian faith , officiated at his wedding and baptised his daughters .
mr obama said he had looked to mr wright for spiritual , not political , guidance .
in a sermon on the sunday after the attacks of 11 september 2001 , mr wright suggested that the us had brought the terror attacks on itself through its own foreign policy .
and in a 2003 sermon , he said blacks should condemn the us because of continuing racial injustice , saying : " god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human . "

ameco , the family firm which has owned mumbles pier for 70 years , said around £ 4m of rebuilding work was essential .
it hopes to fund this by developing the surrounding land with the construction of a hotel and other facilities which it said would create hundreds of jobs .
swansea council 's leader said he was " delighted " about the proposals .
john bollom is managing director of ameco and his father stan rebuilt the pier , which was originally built in 1898 , in 1956 .
annual maintenance was no longer sufficient to safeguard the 250m -lrb- 820ft -rrb- pier 's future and meet health and safety requirements , he said .
he added : " the legs it sits on are fine .
what goes across , like a bridge made up of steel work , and timber decking , everything has to be replaced . "
job creation after running costs are met , the pier does not generate much money , he said , and was not eligible for public grants so to generate the necessary finances they needed to develop the adjoining land by its entrance .
the idea is to demolish the pier hotel and redevelop the site as a luxury 150-bed hotel and spa , he said .
a conference and exhibition centre , attractions and a family entertainment centre plus restaurants , improved public spaces and a new boardwalk linking knab rock to the pier were proposed .
around 450 jobs would be created during construction , said mr bollom , and between 200 - 250 after completion .
the plans were in line with the council 's plans for swansea bay , outlined in the swansea bay strategy , said mr bollom .
they had worked jointly on a development plan , similar to outline planning permission , and mr bollom hoped it would be granted in the next month .

there is a rnli lifeboat station on the pier and the crew are due to receive a larger state-of-the-art lifeboat by 2011 , for which they will need a larger station .
the charity confirmed it was in talks with the pier owners about the best location .
cllr chris holley , swansea council leader , said : " the swansea bay strategy aims to produce nodes around the bay that provide jobs and visitor attractions and the mumbles pier proposals appear to be entirely in line with that .
" we must , therefore , act promptly to ensure this development comes to fruition , once the council has had the opportunity to evaluate the proposals , we will swiftly progress to development stage with ameco . "
jean bunce , secretary of the mumbles tourist association which runs the mumbles tourist information centre , welcomed the hotel idea .
she said : " it was mooted some years ago but came to nothing at the time .
mumbles is so woefully short of hotel accommodation .
a hotel would be absolutely excellent . "

ameco , the family firm which has owned mumbles pier for 70 years , said around £ 4m of rebuilding work was essential .
it hopes to fund this by developing the surrounding land with the construction of a hotel and other facilities which it said would create hundreds of jobs .
swansea council 's leader said he was " delighted " about the proposals .
john bollom is managing director of ameco and his father stan rebuilt the pier , which was originally built in 1898 , in 1956 .
annual maintenance was no longer sufficient to safeguard the 250m -lrb- 820ft -rrb- pier 's future and meet health and safety requirements , he said .
he added : " the legs it sits on are fine .
what goes across , like a bridge made up of steel work , and timber decking , everything has to be replaced . "
job creation after running costs are met , the pier does not generate much money , he said , and was not eligible for public grants so to generate the necessary finances they needed to develop the adjoining land by its entrance .
the idea is to demolish the pier hotel and redevelop the site as a luxury 150-bed hotel and spa , he said .
a conference and exhibition centre , attractions and a family entertainment centre plus restaurants , improved public spaces and a new boardwalk linking knab rock to the pier were proposed .
around 450 jobs would be created during construction , said mr bollom , and between 200 - 250 after completion .
the plans were in line with the council 's plans for swansea bay , outlined in the swansea bay strategy , said mr bollom .
