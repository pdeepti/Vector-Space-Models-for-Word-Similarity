dw-world.de says these guys need to get their acts in gear . the strike farce hertha berlin fans are used to commercial manager dieter hoeneß spending vast sums on star strikers in brazil , who then prove utterly unsuitable to the bundesliga 's more physical style of play .
this year 's model is called andre lima .
the pay-out : 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
the pay-off : one goal . at first glance , nelson valdez 's two goals for dortmund do n't seem that bad - he only had one in all of last season .
but both of this year 's strikes were meaningless score-line fillers in matches whose outcomes had already been decided .
week in , week out valdez has proved remarkably inventive at finding ways to miss open shots - he may soon need to be equally ingenious about finding a new club . dishonorable mentions : ailton -lrb- duisburg -rrb- , victor agali -lrb- rostock -rrb- the malignant midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh dear , schweini 's been off form , too bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger is still considered one of germany 's young stars , but that could change .
he 's bagged just one goal this season , and what 's worse is that he 's been almost invisible on the pitch .
it may be that schweini is still suffering the after-effects of being bitten by a tick this summer . you ca n't really argue with anything bremen 's carlos alberto has done on the pitch because he 's only spent roughly 45 minutes on it .
the most expensive signing in club history at 7.8 million euros , the brazilian came down with a recurring case of insomnia , deemed himself unfit and has only played twice as a late substitute in the league .
had he performed even remotely as well as expected - heck , if he 'd at least shown up regularly - bremen might well be at the top of the table . hertha 's gilberto is a brazilian international , but you would n't know it from his performances this season for berlin .
he 's tallied a meager one goal and two assists , and in december he announced that he was " too physically exhausted " to crank his game up to its best .
not what hertha were hoping from a veteran who was supposed to lead a young squad by example . schalke were praying that uruguayan carlos grossmüller would provide enough offense to finally put them over the top for a bundesliga title .
but he 's failed even to crack their starting line-up .
he did , however , make something of a mark , becoming the first bundesliga player ever to be suspended for getting involved in a fight while on the bench .
he 's currently serving a five-game ban . dishonorable mentions : yildiray bastürk -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- jan rosenthal -lrb- hanover -rrb- , stanislav angelov -lrb- cottbus -rrb- the dire defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld 's back four have adopted a stand back and admire approach with 38 goals conceded , and 8-1 and 6-1 defeats at the hands of bremen and dortmund respectively , bielefeld are the defensive jokes of the league .
with a team this poor at the back , it would be unfair to single out anyone in particular , so we 'll just reserve two spots in our hall of shame for anyone who played in bielefeld 's interior defense .
the names changed - the results rarely did . the other two spots in our porous back four go to a pair of not-so-golden oldies from dortmund : robert kovac and christian wörns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 06.01.2008 marital spats bring german conservatives into modern age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans want politicians to stick with their spouses - even if they do n't themselves criticized for preaching old-fashioned family values long after society left them behind , some observers say a series of personal family problems have modernized germany 's conservative christian parties . love affairs made public , divorce and children born out of wedlock are not taboo on the german political scene .
leaders of germany 's conservative christian parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - struggled with all of the above last year .
this brought them into line with the broader german population , in which about one-third of all marriages ends in divorce . while conservative politicians once criticized former chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democratic party and his former foreign minister joschka fischer of the green for having married four and five times , respectively , commentators have noted that cdu politicians are nowadays less likely to be extolling the virtues of matrimony . " marriage , in the daily lives of many cdu politicians , is no longer as holy as it is in their campaign speeches , " mass-market bild newspaper columnist hugo müller-vogg wrote in december . too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger said he and his wife simply could n't make the marriage work anymore baden-württemberg 's premier , günther oettinger , was the most recent cdu politician to announce his divorce .
after 13 years of marriage , he announced that he and his wife , inken , were splitting up after he found out about her affair with a porsche executive . " into the autumn , i had hoped that my wife and i would succeed at saving our marriage , " he said on dec .
16 .
" i fought for it , but it did n't happen . " the oettingers have since both said in interviews that they agreed to the divorce and would concentrate on raising their 9-year-old son together .
günther oettinger said his wife was increasingly displeased by their busy schedule and numerous public appearances . few political consequences even though two-thirds of germans say they want politicians to lead traditional private lives , according to a december survey conducted by the emnid institute , there are seldom long-term political consequences for politicians who do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff said he was looking forward to his baby 's birth , a wedding and the lower saxony election in 2008 like oettinger , lower saxony 's premier christian wulff remained popular in his party even after announcing plans to divorce his wife of 18 years , with whom he has a daughter , and to marry his current partner , who is pregnant with his second child . unlike the two state premiers , horst seehofer , germany 's minister of agriculture and consumer affairs , was viciously attacked by party members calling his position in the bavarian csu into question after he admitted in july to fathering a child in an extra-martial affair . despite the politically motivated attacks that came in the middle of an internal party election , seehofer 's career - as well as the marriage in which he has three children - has remained intact . ditching double standards it has n't always been so easy for conservative politicians to maintain their careers and marriages . rudolf seiters , who would go on to become germany 's interior minister , had to fight for his parliamentary seat in 1976 because he chose to marry a divorced woman .
members of his own party even accused him of not following the " clearly laid-out instructions of the gospels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should politicians stop pretending they live in a world any different from the people who elect them ?
volker kauder , the cdu / csu parliamentary leader who is often regarded as a staunch defender of conservative values , told the weekly bild am sonntag that divorces happen , even in christian families and that politicians should be held responsible for keeping to the statements they make . along similar lines , the cdu agreed last year to alter its definition of " family , " which had been based on a traditionally christian view of man and wife married with children .
now the party says " family is wherever parents bear permanent responsibility for children and children for parents . " in a rare , though somewhat veiled , indirect compliment , greens parliamentary leader volker beck applauded the conservative parties ' shift from a holier-than-thou attitude .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 06.01.2008 marital spats bring german conservatives into modern age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans want politicians to stick with their spouses - even if they do n't themselves criticized for preaching old-fashioned family values long after society left them behind , some observers say a series of personal family problems have modernized germany 's conservative christian parties . love affairs made public , divorce and children born out of wedlock are not taboo on the german political scene .
leaders of germany 's conservative christian parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - struggled with all of the above last year .
this brought them into line with the broader german population , in which about one-third of all marriages ends in divorce . while conservative politicians once criticized former chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democratic party and his former foreign minister joschka fischer of the green for having married four and five times , respectively , commentators have noted that cdu politicians are nowadays less likely to be extolling the virtues of matrimony . " marriage , in the daily lives of many cdu politicians , is no longer as holy as it is in their campaign speeches , " mass-market bild newspaper columnist hugo müller-vogg wrote in december . too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger said he and his wife simply could n't make the marriage work anymore baden-württemberg 's premier , günther oettinger , was the most recent cdu politician to announce his divorce .
after 13 years of marriage , he announced that he and his wife , inken , were splitting up after he found out about her affair with a porsche executive . " into the autumn , i had hoped that my wife and i would succeed at saving our marriage , " he said on dec .
16 .
" i fought for it , but it did n't happen . " the oettingers have since both said in interviews that they agreed to the divorce and would concentrate on raising their 9-year-old son together .
günther oettinger said his wife was increasingly displeased by their busy schedule and numerous public appearances . few political consequences even though two-thirds of germans say they want politicians to lead traditional private lives , according to a december survey conducted by the emnid institute , there are seldom long-term political consequences for politicians who do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff said he was looking forward to his baby 's birth , a wedding and the lower saxony election in 2008 like oettinger , lower saxony 's premier christian wulff remained popular in his party even after announcing plans to divorce his wife of 18 years , with whom he has a daughter , and to marry his current partner , who is pregnant with his second child . unlike the two state premiers , horst seehofer , germany 's minister of agriculture and consumer affairs , was viciously attacked by party members calling his position in the bavarian csu into question after he admitted in july to fathering a child in an extra-martial affair . despite the politically motivated attacks that came in the middle of an internal party election , seehofer 's career - as well as the marriage in which he has three children - has remained intact . ditching double standards it has n't always been so easy for conservative politicians to maintain their careers and marriages . rudolf seiters , who would go on to become germany 's interior minister , had to fight for his parliamentary seat in 1976 because he chose to marry a divorced woman .
members of his own party even accused him of not following the " clearly laid-out instructions of the gospels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should politicians stop pretending they live in a world any different from the people who elect them ?
volker kauder , the cdu / csu parliamentary leader who is often regarded as a staunch defender of conservative values , told the weekly bild am sonntag that divorces happen , even in christian families and that politicians should be held responsible for keeping to the statements they make . along similar lines , the cdu agreed last year to alter its definition of " family , " which had been based on a traditionally christian view of man and wife married with children .
now the party says " family is wherever parents bear permanent responsibility for children and children for parents . " in a rare , though somewhat veiled , indirect compliment , greens parliamentary leader volker beck applauded the conservative parties ' shift from a holier-than-thou attitude . " some christian conservatives who paint a picture of a so-called perfect family life and then use it for political exploitation are regularly tripped up in their own hypocrisy , " beck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.01.2008 hertha , dortmund top list of bundesliga flops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez , left , has again come up small all the best laid plans of coaches and managers ca n't help , if the players in whom they put the most faith do n't perform on the soccer pitch .
dw-world.de says these guys need to get their acts in gear . the strike farce hertha berlin fans are used to commercial manager dieter hoeneß spending vast sums on star strikers in brazil , who then prove utterly unsuitable to the bundesliga 's more physical style of play .
this year 's model is called andre lima .
the pay-out : 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
the pay-off : one goal . at first glance , nelson valdez 's two goals for dortmund do n't seem that bad - he only had one in all of last season .
but both of this year 's strikes were meaningless score-line fillers in matches whose outcomes had already been decided .
week in , week out valdez has proved remarkably inventive at finding ways to miss open shots - he may soon need to be equally ingenious about finding a new club . dishonorable mentions : ailton -lrb- duisburg -rrb- , victor agali -lrb- rostock -rrb- the malignant midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh dear , schweini 's been off form , too bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger is still considered one of germany 's young stars , but that could change .
he 's bagged just one goal this season , and what 's worse is that he 's been almost invisible on the pitch .
it may be that schweini is still suffering the after-effects of being bitten by a tick this summer . you ca n't really argue with anything bremen 's carlos alberto has done on the pitch because he 's only spent roughly 45 minutes on it .
the most expensive signing in club history at 7.8 million euros , the brazilian came down with a recurring case of insomnia , deemed himself unfit and has only played twice as a late substitute in the league .
had he performed even remotely as well as expected - heck , if he 'd at least shown up regularly - bremen might well be at the top of the table . hertha 's gilberto is a brazilian international , but you would n't know it from his performances this season for berlin .
he 's tallied a meager one goal and two assists , and in december he announced that he was " too physically exhausted " to crank his game up to its best .
not what hertha were hoping from a veteran who was supposed to lead a young squad by example . schalke were praying that uruguayan carlos grossmüller would provide enough offense to finally put them over the top for a bundesliga title .
but he 's failed even to crack their starting line-up .
he did , however , make something of a mark , becoming the first bundesliga player ever to be suspended for getting involved in a fight while on the bench .
he 's currently serving a five-game ban . dishonorable mentions : yildiray bastürk -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- jan rosenthal -lrb- hanover -rrb- , stanislav angelov -lrb- cottbus -rrb- the dire defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld 's back four have adopted a stand back and admire approach with 38 goals conceded , and 8-1 and 6-1 defeats at the hands of bremen and dortmund respectively , bielefeld are the defensive jokes of the league .
with a team this poor at the back , it would be unfair to single out anyone in particular , so we 'll just reserve two spots in our hall of shame for anyone who played in bielefeld 's interior defense .
the names changed - the results rarely did . the other two spots in our porous back four go to a pair of not-so-golden oldies from dortmund : robert kovac and christian wörns .
kovac 's career includes successful spells at juventus and bayern , but at the age of 33 , he looks clearly past his sell-by date and landed on the bench in december . the 35-year-old wörns - long a member of the german national team - could join him on the sidelines in 2008 .
always known for his physical play , wörns ' game now consists largely of clutching desperately at where strikers used to be , then watching as the keeper retrieves the ball form the back of the net . dishonorable mentions : sofian chahed -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- , vragel da silva -lrb- cottbus -rrb- , michael beauchamp -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- number one no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jentzsch has bottomed out with wolfsburg wolfsburg gave simon jentzsch a contract extension before this season in recognition of his status as one of germany 's most underrated keepers .
they probably wish they had n't , as jentzsch seems to have has lost his sense for how to deal with most penalty area situations .
the result : wolfburg conceded 30 goals , and their undisputed number 1 at the start of the season was benched in december . dishonorable mentions : rafael schäfer -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , roman weidenfeller -lrb- dortmund -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city , which during world war ii played a key role in the soviet union 's war efforts and later became the base for the north sea fleet , has been transformed into an industrial wasteland with dilapitated factories and piles of rubbish and debris lining up against the horizon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotting submarines off the coast at murmansk from behind the razor wire of a restricted military area , ship wrecks can be seen rising from the sea .
moored to floating pontoons , some 150 red-brown hulls - discarded nuclear submarines - bob up and down in the fish-rich fjords .
these dying vessels were once the pride of the soviet union .
for over two years , german company ewn has been building storage facilities in murmansk to hold the reactors from the decommissioned and disintegrating russian nuclear submarines .
the german engineers working on the project know a lot about russian nuclear technology .
many of them studied in the former soviet union .
the large concrete area , about the size of a soccer pitch , and the huge containers which sit upon it will eventually provide a home for all the potentially hazardous atomic cores of the rotting vessels and help prevent any environmental disasters arising from a rupture at sea .
the cost of preventing a catastrophe is currently in the range of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 441.5 million -rrb- .
a costly enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subs are transported to nearby nerpa to be cut up utilizing shipyard workers from the nearby port of nerpa , ewn has supervised the removal of the highly radioactive fuel elements from the submarines .
for the russians , the work is important but sad .
sawing the pride of the soviet navy to bits claws at the russian soul .
each submarine cost moscow over two billion dollars .
a floating dock brings the steel colossi along the fjord coast to the storage facilities , providing a safe and stable base for the fragile vessels on the unpredictable sea .
a rail system pulls the hulks from the sea and takes the reactors to their new storage areas .
fourteen have already been safely re-housed .
seven more currently wait in the nerpa shipyard to make the journey down the coast .
the germans are not helping the russians simply out of the goodness of their hearts .
there is a common objective .
germany has an interest in preventing any nuclear disasters on the barents sea coast .
with europe 's northern coastline abutting russia 's , helping to secure the reactors at murmansk reduces the risk of potential contamination in european waters .
to that effect , germany is hoping to contribute to another storage facility for low to medium-radioactive waste .
it is hoped that in time , the current threat from the former soviet union 's nuclear submarine fleet will go the way of the previous one : eradicated by cooperation and understanding . stefan dege -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city , which during world war ii played a key role in the soviet union 's war efforts and later became the base for the north sea fleet , has been transformed into an industrial wasteland with dilapitated factories and piles of rubbish and debris lining up against the horizon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotting submarines off the coast at murmansk from behind the razor wire of a restricted military area , ship wrecks can be seen rising from the sea .
moored to floating pontoons , some 150 red-brown hulls - discarded nuclear submarines - bob up and down in the fish-rich fjords .
these dying vessels were once the pride of the soviet union .
for over two years , german company ewn has been building storage facilities in murmansk to hold the reactors from the decommissioned and disintegrating russian nuclear submarines .
the german engineers working on the project know a lot about russian nuclear technology .
many of them studied in the former soviet union .
the large concrete area , about the size of a soccer pitch , and the huge containers which sit upon it will eventually provide a home for all the potentially hazardous atomic cores of the rotting vessels and help prevent any environmental disasters arising from a rupture at sea .
the cost of preventing a catastrophe is currently in the range of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 441.5 million -rrb- .
a costly enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subs are transported to nearby nerpa to be cut up utilizing shipyard workers from the nearby port of nerpa , ewn has supervised the removal of the highly radioactive fuel elements from the submarines .
for the russians , the work is important but sad .
sawing the pride of the soviet navy to bits claws at the russian soul .
each submarine cost moscow over two billion dollars .
a floating dock brings the steel colossi along the fjord coast to the storage facilities , providing a safe and stable base for the fragile vessels on the unpredictable sea .
a rail system pulls the hulks from the sea and takes the reactors to their new storage areas .
fourteen have already been safely re-housed .
seven more currently wait in the nerpa shipyard to make the journey down the coast .
the germans are not helping the russians simply out of the goodness of their hearts .
there is a common objective .
germany has an interest in preventing any nuclear disasters on the barents sea coast .
with europe 's northern coastline abutting russia 's , helping to secure the reactors at murmansk reduces the risk of potential contamination in european waters .
to that effect , germany is hoping to contribute to another storage facility for low to medium-radioactive waste .
it is hoped that in time , the current threat from the former soviet union 's nuclear submarine fleet will go the way of the previous one : eradicated by cooperation and understanding . stefan dege -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city , which during world war ii played a key role in the soviet union 's war efforts and later became the base for the north sea fleet , has been transformed into an industrial wasteland with dilapitated factories and piles of rubbish and debris lining up against the horizon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotting submarines off the coast at murmansk from behind the razor wire of a restricted military area , ship wrecks can be seen rising from the sea .
moored to floating pontoons , some 150 red-brown hulls - discarded nuclear submarines - bob up and down in the fish-rich fjords .
these dying vessels were once the pride of the soviet union .
for over two years , german company ewn has been building storage facilities in murmansk to hold the reactors from the decommissioned and disintegrating russian nuclear submarines .
the german engineers working on the project know a lot about russian nuclear technology .
many of them studied in the former soviet union .
the large concrete area , about the size of a soccer pitch , and the huge containers which sit upon it will eventually provide a home for all the potentially hazardous atomic cores of the rotting vessels and help prevent any environmental disasters arising from a rupture at sea .
the cost of preventing a catastrophe is currently in the range of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 441.5 million -rrb- .
a costly enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subs are transported to nearby nerpa to be cut up utilizing shipyard workers from the nearby port of nerpa , ewn has supervised the removal of the highly radioactive fuel elements from the submarines .
for the russians , the work is important but sad .
sawing the pride of the soviet navy to bits claws at the russian soul .
each submarine cost moscow over two billion dollars .
a floating dock brings the steel colossi along the fjord coast to the storage facilities , providing a safe and stable base for the fragile vessels on the unpredictable sea .
a rail system pulls the hulks from the sea and takes the reactors to their new storage areas .
fourteen have already been safely re-housed .
seven more currently wait in the nerpa shipyard to make the journey down the coast .
the germans are not helping the russians simply out of the goodness of their hearts .
there is a common objective .
germany has an interest in preventing any nuclear disasters on the barents sea coast .
with europe 's northern coastline abutting russia 's , helping to secure the reactors at murmansk reduces the risk of potential contamination in european waters .
to that effect , germany is hoping to contribute to another storage facility for low to medium-radioactive waste .
it is hoped that in time , the current threat from the former soviet union 's nuclear submarine fleet will go the way of the previous one : eradicated by cooperation and understanding . stefan dege -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dr phil mcgraw said he was convinced she was " in dire need of both medical and psychological intervention " .
the star was taken to hospital on a stretcher after a hysterical outburst at her home , with police called to try to settle a dispute about her two sons .
a court commissioner then removed her right to look after or visit the boys .
as a result , spears ' ex-husband , kevin federline , now has sole custody of sean preston , who is two , and one-year-old jayden james .
a further court hearing is to be held on 14 january to consider the welfare of the children .
' very concerned ' dr mcgraw , who presents a self-titled programme helping people with their psychological problems , said he went to see spears at the cedars-sinai medical center .
" she was released moments before my arrival and was packing when i entered the room , " he told american tv programmes entertainment tonight and the insider .
" we visited for about an hour before i walked with her to her car .
i am very concerned for her . "
no details have been given by the hospital as to why spears , 26 , was admitted on thursday evening .
it was reported that , when police went to the singer 's hilltop mansion , she was under the influence of an unknown substance .
after a three-hour stand-off , spears was lifted into an ambulance , which was then chased by a number of paparazzi photographers .

the fundraising event saw thousands of women wearing decorated bras as they powerwalked through the city at night .
organiser walk the walk has joined with maggies , which runs centres to help those diagnosed with cancer and their families and carers .
the new building will cost £ 2.1m and will be set up at gartnavel hospital .
edinburgh 's 2006 moonwalk was the first to be held outside london , where it has been an annual event since 1998 .
the participants , including some men , left the meadows at midnight and travelled either 13.1 miles , a half moon , or the full moon , 26.2 miles .
with the addition of maggie 's gartnavel we can do so much more laura lee maggie 's chief executive the feat was repeated again last year where television presenter lorraine kelly was among those taking part .
the founder of the moonwalk , nina barough , told bbc scotland that she was amazed at how successful it had been .
she said : " it was very difficult when we actually started the moonwalk in edinburgh to know how well it would be supported , or how much fundraising would actually be acheived .
" i think we 've completely gone beyond all our goals on both counts and have been able to raise in excess of £ 4m . "
she added : " glasgow has the highest incidence of cancer of any local council area in scotland , a second centre is vital and will provide thousands more with exceptional cancer care .
" a huge hug and thanks should go to all those that have taken part in the moonwalk edinburgh , without their fantastic support over the past two years and their future support , this grant would not be possible . "
maggie 's chief executive , laura lee , added : " maggie 's gartnavel centre will be very important for people living with cancer and their family and friends because of its accessibility to oncology services at the beatson .
" we are delighted to be supporting 12,000 visits a year in glasgow but we know with the addition of maggie 's gartnavel we can do so much more .
thank you to walk the walk worldwide for this crucial funding . "
