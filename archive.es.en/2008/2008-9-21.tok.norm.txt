" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .

" i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .
it is important to think about measures such as banning speculation on falling shares rather than using taxpayers ' money , meister said . " i do n't think it 's appropriate that we use taxpayers ' money in germany to intervene in the markets , " he added . us wants other nations to set up similar plans on sunday , sept 21 , us treasury secretary henry paulson called for other nations to set up similar rescue plans . he did not provide further details , but us financial authorities have been working closely with their counterparts in europe and japan over the past 10 days to prevent a collapse of the interwoven global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other nations to set up similiar rescue plans " we have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and i believe a number of them will , " paulson said on the abc program " this week . " referring to paulson 's comments , joachim poss , deputy parliamentary head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said germany would not do the same . " the americans ca n't make germany accountable for their failure and their arrogance , " poss said .
" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight . " it can not work like that on an international level , " merkel said . merkel said that she had tried to win support for greater transparency and regulation on international markets at the g-8 conference last year , but that governments including the us did not heed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been bluntly critical of us failures in the current crisis germany had expressed fears that hedge funds could threaten the stability of the financial system through their heavy reliance on borrowing to finance risky trading strategies .
it has also raised concerns about private equity funds .
in a separate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets . " i criticize the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.09.2008 berlin premieres magic dressing room mirror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magic mirror could appeal to men who find shopping for clothes a chore would n't it be nice if we could shop for clothes without having to try them on ?
that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .
officials said the german national , whose name could not immediately be confirmed , had been staying in bossaso for several weeks .
" the german citizen was trying to visit his wife 's relatives when the gunmen kidnapped .
we have been told that he is a muslim with a somali wife who resides in bossaso , " puntland presidential adviser bile mohamoud qabowsade said .
armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .
southern somalia has been torn by 17 years of almost uninterrupted civil conflict since the 1991 ouster of former president mohamed siad barre .
thousands of civilians have died in the guerrilla war that has pitted invading ethiopian troops against islamist insurgents since last year .
the self-declared state of puntland has been largely spared by the latest violence but it has been used by pirates taking foreign ships hostage and gangs smuggling goods , arms and people across the gulf of aden . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .

the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .
officials said the german national , whose name could not immediately be confirmed , had been staying in bossaso for several weeks .
" the german citizen was trying to visit his wife 's relatives when the gunmen kidnapped .
we have been told that he is a muslim with a somali wife who resides in bossaso , " puntland presidential adviser bile mohamoud qabowsade said .
armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .
southern somalia has been torn by 17 years of almost uninterrupted civil conflict since the 1991 ouster of former president mohamed siad barre .
thousands of civilians have died in the guerrilla war that has pitted invading ethiopian troops against islamist insurgents since last year .
the self-declared state of puntland has been largely spared by the latest violence but it has been used by pirates taking foreign ships hostage and gangs smuggling goods , arms and people across the gulf of aden . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .

putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .

" i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .
it is important to think about measures such as banning speculation on falling shares rather than using taxpayers ' money , meister said . " i do n't think it 's appropriate that we use taxpayers ' money in germany to intervene in the markets , " he added . us wants other nations to set up similar plans on sunday , sept 21 , us treasury secretary henry paulson called for other nations to set up similar rescue plans . he did not provide further details , but us financial authorities have been working closely with their counterparts in europe and japan over the past 10 days to prevent a collapse of the interwoven global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other nations to set up similiar rescue plans " we have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and i believe a number of them will , " paulson said on the abc program " this week . " referring to paulson 's comments , joachim poss , deputy parliamentary head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said germany would not do the same . " the americans ca n't make germany accountable for their failure and their arrogance , " poss said .
" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight .

it has also raised concerns about private equity funds .
in a separate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets . " i criticize the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said .
" on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " the chancellor also reiterated calls for tighter regulation of financial markets . " europe must see to it that we get more transparency on financial markets , clear rules and that crises such as the current one are n't repeated , " she said . in the face of the latest financial storm and a global credit crunch , experts have lowered their economic growth estimates for germany and europe next year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .

armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .

instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .
france currently holds the rotating eu council presidency .
negotiations in line with troop pull-out deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's shake on it : russia and the eu edge closer again under the peace plan agreed by russian president dmitry medvedev and his french counterpart nicholas sarkozy , moscow is to withdraw its troops by october 10 from the georgian mainland bordering the separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .
russia is set to sell 10 soyuz carrier rockets to the french arianespace company for up to $ 400 million under a deal signed in sochi with the roskosmos space aviation authority .
the first soyuz rocket was due to start by the end of 2009 , arianespace general director jean-yves le gall said .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .

however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.09.2008 berlin premieres magic dressing room mirror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magic mirror could appeal to men who find shopping for clothes a chore would n't it be nice if we could shop for clothes without having to try them on ?
that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .

that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.09.2008 berlin premieres magic dressing room mirror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magic mirror could appeal to men who find shopping for clothes a chore would n't it be nice if we could shop for clothes without having to try them on ?
that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.09.2008 klinsmann refuses advice to drown sorrows after heavy defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann decided that joining his players for a beer was not such a good idea bayern munich 's hangover on sunday did n't come from a long night at the oktoberfest , but from a painful 5-2 bundesliga loss against werder bremen .
coach juergen klinsmann however , refused to drown his post-match sorrows . munich boss franz beckenbauer told coach juergen klinsmann after saturday 's debacle to drown his sorrows at the famed beerfest which opened the same day .
" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .
munich rebounded with a 6-2 triumph over sv hamburg in their next home match but eventually finished a dismal seventh in that season .
hierarchy knows the pain of heavy defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was sympathetic to klinsi 's plight that is something klinsmann can not afford in his debut season at the champions , after being chosen as coach in a surprise move by munich 's leadership of beckenbauer , uli hoeness and karl-heinz rummenigge -lrb- who all played in that 1976 match -rrb- .
klinsmann , 44 , has completely overhauled munich 's training regime and personnel .
he is condemned to win titles and is convinced that saturday 's performance will not be repeated .
" we suffered a big blow .
you have to admit that the opponent was better and tought us a lesson .
now we have to learn from that . "
" we have hit the ground .
but we will get up again and become even stronger , " vowed klinsmann .
" bremen were the better team , most of all because they were ruthless with their chances .
they hit us with the next blow every time we were finding our way back .
" unfortunately , we came up short of what was needed to win the game , but the team will be very self-critical when dealing with this defeat and then we 'll look to the future , " klinsmann added .
" i believe you learn a great deal from days like today . "
borowski expresses team 's embarassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star borowski felt the pain goal-scorer borowski admitted he had difficulty coming to terms with the result and apologised to fans .
" i can hardly believe we 've conceded five goals , " said the german midfielder .
" we were absolutely terrible , no doubt about it , and we owe every fan in the stadium an apology .
" i sensed we were a little lethargic , " he added with innocent understatement .
" we were never close enough to them , we never put bremen under any kind of pressure , and you ca n't do that against a team as strong as bremen .
" there 's bound to be criticism after a performance like that , and we 'll have to take it on the chin . "

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .
france currently holds the rotating eu council presidency .
negotiations in line with troop pull-out deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's shake on it : russia and the eu edge closer again under the peace plan agreed by russian president dmitry medvedev and his french counterpart nicholas sarkozy , moscow is to withdraw its troops by october 10 from the georgian mainland bordering the separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .
russia is set to sell 10 soyuz carrier rockets to the french arianespace company for up to $ 400 million under a deal signed in sochi with the roskosmos space aviation authority .
the first soyuz rocket was due to start by the end of 2009 , arianespace general director jean-yves le gall said .
climate and energy agreements signed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and russia agreed on energy and climate issues on the sidelines of the sochi talks , political and business delegates from the two countries also inked an agreement on cooperation in the fields of environmental and climate protection as well as energy efficiency .
the two-day meeting was the 13th convention of the franco-russian government commission .

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .
france currently holds the rotating eu council presidency .
negotiations in line with troop pull-out deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's shake on it : russia and the eu edge closer again under the peace plan agreed by russian president dmitry medvedev and his french counterpart nicholas sarkozy , moscow is to withdraw its troops by october 10 from the georgian mainland bordering the separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .
russia is set to sell 10 soyuz carrier rockets to the french arianespace company for up to $ 400 million under a deal signed in sochi with the roskosmos space aviation authority .
the first soyuz rocket was due to start by the end of 2009 , arianespace general director jean-yves le gall said .
climate and energy agreements signed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and russia agreed on energy and climate issues on the sidelines of the sochi talks , political and business delegates from the two countries also inked an agreement on cooperation in the fields of environmental and climate protection as well as energy efficiency .
the two-day meeting was the 13th convention of the franco-russian government commission .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

coach juergen klinsmann however , refused to drown his post-match sorrows . munich boss franz beckenbauer told coach juergen klinsmann after saturday 's debacle to drown his sorrows at the famed beerfest which opened the same day .
" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.09.2008 un warns world market slump may affect anti-poverty fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global financial crisis is already hindering un efforts at helping the world 's poor the un general assembly will review efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger next week , just as the world economy is slumping and high food prices have stripped the poor of their purchasing power . the summit at un headquarters in new york on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- on thursday takes place at a time the world 's biggest donors , like the united states and european nations , are struggling to prop up their failing economies and may no longer be able to assist the un with big checks .
the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .

" i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .
it is important to think about measures such as banning speculation on falling shares rather than using taxpayers ' money , meister said . " i do n't think it 's appropriate that we use taxpayers ' money in germany to intervene in the markets , " he added . us wants other nations to set up similar plans on sunday , sept 21 , us treasury secretary henry paulson called for other nations to set up similar rescue plans . he did not provide further details , but us financial authorities have been working closely with their counterparts in europe and japan over the past 10 days to prevent a collapse of the interwoven global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other nations to set up similiar rescue plans " we have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and i believe a number of them will , " paulson said on the abc program " this week . " referring to paulson 's comments , joachim poss , deputy parliamentary head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said germany would not do the same . " the americans ca n't make germany accountable for their failure and their arrogance , " poss said .
" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight . " it can not work like that on an international level , " merkel said . merkel said that she had tried to win support for greater transparency and regulation on international markets at the g-8 conference last year , but that governments including the us did not heed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been bluntly critical of us failures in the current crisis germany had expressed fears that hedge funds could threaten the stability of the financial system through their heavy reliance on borrowing to finance risky trading strategies .
it has also raised concerns about private equity funds .
in a separate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets . " i criticize the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said .
" on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " the chancellor also reiterated calls for tighter regulation of financial markets . " europe must see to it that we get more transparency on financial markets , clear rules and that crises such as the current one are n't repeated , " she said . in the face of the latest financial storm and a global credit crunch , experts have lowered their economic growth estimates for germany and europe next year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .

coach juergen klinsmann however , refused to drown his post-match sorrows . munich boss franz beckenbauer told coach juergen klinsmann after saturday 's debacle to drown his sorrows at the famed beerfest which opened the same day .
" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .

klinsmann , 44 , has completely overhauled munich 's training regime and personnel .
he is condemned to win titles and is convinced that saturday 's performance will not be repeated .
" we suffered a big blow .
you have to admit that the opponent was better and tought us a lesson .
now we have to learn from that . "
" we have hit the ground .
but we will get up again and become even stronger , " vowed klinsmann .
" bremen were the better team , most of all because they were ruthless with their chances .
they hit us with the next blow every time we were finding our way back .
" unfortunately , we came up short of what was needed to win the game , but the team will be very self-critical when dealing with this defeat and then we 'll look to the future , " klinsmann added .
" i believe you learn a great deal from days like today . "
borowski expresses team 's embarassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star borowski felt the pain goal-scorer borowski admitted he had difficulty coming to terms with the result and apologised to fans .

" we were absolutely terrible , no doubt about it , and we owe every fan in the stadium an apology .
" i sensed we were a little lethargic , " he added with innocent understatement .
" we were never close enough to them , we never put bremen under any kind of pressure , and you ca n't do that against a team as strong as bremen .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .
munich rebounded with a 6-2 triumph over sv hamburg in their next home match but eventually finished a dismal seventh in that season .

klinsmann , 44 , has completely overhauled munich 's training regime and personnel .
he is condemned to win titles and is convinced that saturday 's performance will not be repeated .
" we suffered a big blow .
you have to admit that the opponent was better and tought us a lesson .
now we have to learn from that . "
" we have hit the ground .
but we will get up again and become even stronger , " vowed klinsmann .
" bremen were the better team , most of all because they were ruthless with their chances .
they hit us with the next blow every time we were finding our way back .
" unfortunately , we came up short of what was needed to win the game , but the team will be very self-critical when dealing with this defeat and then we 'll look to the future , " klinsmann added .
" i believe you learn a great deal from days like today . "

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .
officials said the german national , whose name could not immediately be confirmed , had been staying in bossaso for several weeks .
" the german citizen was trying to visit his wife 's relatives when the gunmen kidnapped .
we have been told that he is a muslim with a somali wife who resides in bossaso , " puntland presidential adviser bile mohamoud qabowsade said .
armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .
southern somalia has been torn by 17 years of almost uninterrupted civil conflict since the 1991 ouster of former president mohamed siad barre .
thousands of civilians have died in the guerrilla war that has pitted invading ethiopian troops against islamist insurgents since last year .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .
france currently holds the rotating eu council presidency .
negotiations in line with troop pull-out deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's shake on it : russia and the eu edge closer again under the peace plan agreed by russian president dmitry medvedev and his french counterpart nicholas sarkozy , moscow is to withdraw its troops by october 10 from the georgian mainland bordering the separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .
russia is set to sell 10 soyuz carrier rockets to the french arianespace company for up to $ 400 million under a deal signed in sochi with the roskosmos space aviation authority .
the first soyuz rocket was due to start by the end of 2009 , arianespace general director jean-yves le gall said .
climate and energy agreements signed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and russia agreed on energy and climate issues on the sidelines of the sochi talks , political and business delegates from the two countries also inked an agreement on cooperation in the fields of environmental and climate protection as well as energy efficiency .

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .

" the german citizen was trying to visit his wife 's relatives when the gunmen kidnapped .
we have been told that he is a muslim with a somali wife who resides in bossaso , " puntland presidential adviser bile mohamoud qabowsade said .
armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .
southern somalia has been torn by 17 years of almost uninterrupted civil conflict since the 1991 ouster of former president mohamed siad barre .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .

but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

coach juergen klinsmann however , refused to drown his post-match sorrows . munich boss franz beckenbauer told coach juergen klinsmann after saturday 's debacle to drown his sorrows at the famed beerfest which opened the same day .
" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .
munich rebounded with a 6-2 triumph over sv hamburg in their next home match but eventually finished a dismal seventh in that season .
hierarchy knows the pain of heavy defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was sympathetic to klinsi 's plight that is something klinsmann can not afford in his debut season at the champions , after being chosen as coach in a surprise move by munich 's leadership of beckenbauer , uli hoeness and karl-heinz rummenigge -lrb- who all played in that 1976 match -rrb- .
klinsmann , 44 , has completely overhauled munich 's training regime and personnel .
he is condemned to win titles and is convinced that saturday 's performance will not be repeated .
" we suffered a big blow .
you have to admit that the opponent was better and tought us a lesson .
now we have to learn from that . "
" we have hit the ground .
but we will get up again and become even stronger , " vowed klinsmann .
" bremen were the better team , most of all because they were ruthless with their chances .
they hit us with the next blow every time we were finding our way back .
" unfortunately , we came up short of what was needed to win the game , but the team will be very self-critical when dealing with this defeat and then we 'll look to the future , " klinsmann added .
" i believe you learn a great deal from days like today . "
borowski expresses team 's embarassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star borowski felt the pain goal-scorer borowski admitted he had difficulty coming to terms with the result and apologised to fans .
" i can hardly believe we 've conceded five goals , " said the german midfielder .
" we were absolutely terrible , no doubt about it , and we owe every fan in the stadium an apology .
" i sensed we were a little lethargic , " he added with innocent understatement .
" we were never close enough to them , we never put bremen under any kind of pressure , and you ca n't do that against a team as strong as bremen .
" there 's bound to be criticism after a performance like that , and we 'll have to take it on the chin . "

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.09.2008 un warns world market slump may affect anti-poverty fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global financial crisis is already hindering un efforts at helping the world 's poor the un general assembly will review efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger next week , just as the world economy is slumping and high food prices have stripped the poor of their purchasing power . the summit at un headquarters in new york on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- on thursday takes place at a time the world 's biggest donors , like the united states and european nations , are struggling to prop up their failing economies and may no longer be able to assist the un with big checks .
the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .

he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

" i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .
it is important to think about measures such as banning speculation on falling shares rather than using taxpayers ' money , meister said . " i do n't think it 's appropriate that we use taxpayers ' money in germany to intervene in the markets , " he added . us wants other nations to set up similar plans on sunday , sept 21 , us treasury secretary henry paulson called for other nations to set up similar rescue plans . he did not provide further details , but us financial authorities have been working closely with their counterparts in europe and japan over the past 10 days to prevent a collapse of the interwoven global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other nations to set up similiar rescue plans " we have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and i believe a number of them will , " paulson said on the abc program " this week . " referring to paulson 's comments , joachim poss , deputy parliamentary head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said germany would not do the same . " the americans ca n't make germany accountable for their failure and their arrogance , " poss said .
" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight . " it can not work like that on an international level , " merkel said . merkel said that she had tried to win support for greater transparency and regulation on international markets at the g-8 conference last year , but that governments including the us did not heed her .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.09.2008 un warns world market slump may affect anti-poverty fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global financial crisis is already hindering un efforts at helping the world 's poor the un general assembly will review efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger next week , just as the world economy is slumping and high food prices have stripped the poor of their purchasing power . the summit at un headquarters in new york on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- on thursday takes place at a time the world 's biggest donors , like the united states and european nations , are struggling to prop up their failing economies and may no longer be able to assist the un with big checks .
the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .
officials said the german national , whose name could not immediately be confirmed , had been staying in bossaso for several weeks .
" the german citizen was trying to visit his wife 's relatives when the gunmen kidnapped .
we have been told that he is a muslim with a somali wife who resides in bossaso , " puntland presidential adviser bile mohamoud qabowsade said .
armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .
southern somalia has been torn by 17 years of almost uninterrupted civil conflict since the 1991 ouster of former president mohamed siad barre .
thousands of civilians have died in the guerrilla war that has pitted invading ethiopian troops against islamist insurgents since last year .
the self-declared state of puntland has been largely spared by the latest violence but it has been used by pirates taking foreign ships hostage and gangs smuggling goods , arms and people across the gulf of aden . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .
it is important to think about measures such as banning speculation on falling shares rather than using taxpayers ' money , meister said . " i do n't think it 's appropriate that we use taxpayers ' money in germany to intervene in the markets , " he added . us wants other nations to set up similar plans on sunday , sept 21 , us treasury secretary henry paulson called for other nations to set up similar rescue plans . he did not provide further details , but us financial authorities have been working closely with their counterparts in europe and japan over the past 10 days to prevent a collapse of the interwoven global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other nations to set up similiar rescue plans " we have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and i believe a number of them will , " paulson said on the abc program " this week . " referring to paulson 's comments , joachim poss , deputy parliamentary head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said germany would not do the same . " the americans ca n't make germany accountable for their failure and their arrogance , " poss said .
" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight . " it can not work like that on an international level , " merkel said . merkel said that she had tried to win support for greater transparency and regulation on international markets at the g-8 conference last year , but that governments including the us did not heed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been bluntly critical of us failures in the current crisis germany had expressed fears that hedge funds could threaten the stability of the financial system through their heavy reliance on borrowing to finance risky trading strategies .
it has also raised concerns about private equity funds .
in a separate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets . " i criticize the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said .
" on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " the chancellor also reiterated calls for tighter regulation of financial markets . " europe must see to it that we get more transparency on financial markets , clear rules and that crises such as the current one are n't repeated , " she said . in the face of the latest financial storm and a global credit crunch , experts have lowered their economic growth estimates for germany and europe next year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.09.2008 berlin premieres magic dressing room mirror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magic mirror could appeal to men who find shopping for clothes a chore would n't it be nice if we could shop for clothes without having to try them on ?
that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?

the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.09.2008 smart car celebrates success after bumpy start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car has finally begun to pay off for daimler celebrating its tenth anniversary this month , the smart is finally becoming a rising star in the daimler company after a bumpy ride and many experts predicting the early demise of the microcar . when its inventor , the swiss watchmaker nicolas g. hayek , mooted the idea of building a city car with space for two adults and a shopping bag it was seen by many as something of a joke .
but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .
summing up the late success of the smart , zetsche remarked : " had we not invented it 10 years ago , we would have to do so now . " dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.09.2008 smart car celebrates success after bumpy start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car has finally begun to pay off for daimler celebrating its tenth anniversary this month , the smart is finally becoming a rising star in the daimler company after a bumpy ride and many experts predicting the early demise of the microcar . when its inventor , the swiss watchmaker nicolas g. hayek , mooted the idea of building a city car with space for two adults and a shopping bag it was seen by many as something of a joke .
but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .
summing up the late success of the smart , zetsche remarked : " had we not invented it 10 years ago , we would have to do so now . " dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.09.2008 berlin premieres magic dressing room mirror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magic mirror could appeal to men who find shopping for clothes a chore would n't it be nice if we could shop for clothes without having to try them on ?
that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .

that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .

but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .

that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.09.2008 klinsmann refuses advice to drown sorrows after heavy defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann decided that joining his players for a beer was not such a good idea bayern munich 's hangover on sunday did n't come from a long night at the oktoberfest , but from a painful 5-2 bundesliga loss against werder bremen .
coach juergen klinsmann however , refused to drown his post-match sorrows . munich boss franz beckenbauer told coach juergen klinsmann after saturday 's debacle to drown his sorrows at the famed beerfest which opened the same day .
" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .
munich rebounded with a 6-2 triumph over sv hamburg in their next home match but eventually finished a dismal seventh in that season .
hierarchy knows the pain of heavy defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was sympathetic to klinsi 's plight that is something klinsmann can not afford in his debut season at the champions , after being chosen as coach in a surprise move by munich 's leadership of beckenbauer , uli hoeness and karl-heinz rummenigge -lrb- who all played in that 1976 match -rrb- .
klinsmann , 44 , has completely overhauled munich 's training regime and personnel .
he is condemned to win titles and is convinced that saturday 's performance will not be repeated .
" we suffered a big blow .
you have to admit that the opponent was better and tought us a lesson .
now we have to learn from that . "
" we have hit the ground .
but we will get up again and become even stronger , " vowed klinsmann .
" bremen were the better team , most of all because they were ruthless with their chances .
they hit us with the next blow every time we were finding our way back .
" unfortunately , we came up short of what was needed to win the game , but the team will be very self-critical when dealing with this defeat and then we 'll look to the future , " klinsmann added .
" i believe you learn a great deal from days like today . "
borowski expresses team 's embarassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star borowski felt the pain goal-scorer borowski admitted he had difficulty coming to terms with the result and apologised to fans .
" i can hardly believe we 've conceded five goals , " said the german midfielder .
" we were absolutely terrible , no doubt about it , and we owe every fan in the stadium an apology .
" i sensed we were a little lethargic , " he added with innocent understatement .
" we were never close enough to them , we never put bremen under any kind of pressure , and you ca n't do that against a team as strong as bremen .
" there 's bound to be criticism after a performance like that , and we 'll have to take it on the chin . "

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

" the german national and his somali wife were kidnapped by gunmen who took them towards the mountainous areas in eastern bossaso , " he said .
officials said the german national , whose name could not immediately be confirmed , had been staying in bossaso for several weeks .
" the german citizen was trying to visit his wife 's relatives when the gunmen kidnapped .
we have been told that he is a muslim with a somali wife who resides in bossaso , " puntland presidential adviser bile mohamoud qabowsade said .
armed gangs in puntland elsewhere in somalia have carried out scores of kidnappings in recent months , often targeting foreigners or somalis working with international organizations to demand ransoms .
kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .

" if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque .

but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .

fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .

hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .

that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight . " it can not work like that on an international level , " merkel said . merkel said that she had tried to win support for greater transparency and regulation on international markets at the g-8 conference last year , but that governments including the us did not heed her .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .

the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .

the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .

sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .

but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .

the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .
he vowed to fully renovate the hotel within four months . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 21.09.2008 financial crisis not over yet , european banking expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us rescue plan has sparked relief and revived stocks but the crisis may not be over yet juergen stark , member of the european central bank 's executive board , told deutsche welle better risk management is needed after the financial earthquake on wall street and warned the crisis was far from over . mr stark , we 're in the ecb tower and things feel pretty calm here .
but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.09.2008 smart car celebrates success after bumpy start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car has finally begun to pay off for daimler celebrating its tenth anniversary this month , the smart is finally becoming a rising star in the daimler company after a bumpy ride and many experts predicting the early demise of the microcar . when its inventor , the swiss watchmaker nicolas g. hayek , mooted the idea of building a city car with space for two adults and a shopping bag it was seen by many as something of a joke .
but with mercedes-benz joining the project as co-partner in the micro compact car company , the idea became reality in 1998 .
however , hayek soon become disillusioned by the big luxury car maker 's approach to the project and eventually sold all his shares to daimler .
" the swatch mobile was supposed to be an eco-friendly , cheap small car with hybrid drive , but they turned it into a laughable small version of a mercedes , " hayek remarked later in an interview .
hayek criticised the high price of the car aimed at the lower price segment .
the first smart generation never reached the expected sales levels on european markets and became a serious headache for daimler which had hit a rough patch after the troubled merger with chrysler .
production of the smart roadster and four-seater forfour were stopped and plans to build a mini smart suv scuttled .
in the year 2005 , daimler slashed 600 jobs at the smart headquarters based in the french town of hambach as part of a 1.1 billion euro cost-cutting program .
according to some reports daimler had by then sunk around 8 billion euros into the smart project .
creature comforts boost smart sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new features have boosted the marketability of the smart but with the introduction of the second generation smart fortwo in 2007 , sales have steadily been rising .
fitted with all the comforts of a bigger sedan such as electronic stability program -lrb- esp -rrb- , abs brakes , four airbags and a safety cell , it was a big improvement on the first smart .
the smart fortwo also came just at the right time on the u.s. market this year when customers were turning away from fuel-guzzlers in droves .
so far some 11,400 smarts have been delivered to the united states and customers wait an average of a year after placing their order .
with the sales spurt in the us , daimler this year alone expects to sell about 130,000 smarts worldwide compared to a total of 900,000 deliveries over the past ten years in 37 countries .
new modifications announced on its tenth birthday the smart finally appears to fulfil the destiny marked out by its inventor hayek .
daimler has just announced that from october 2008 all the petrol-engined 45 kw / 61 hp and 52 kw / 71 hp smart fortwos would be fitted standard with micro hybrid drive -lrb- mhd -rrb- and fuel-saving start-stop systems .
fuel consumption has been reduced from 4.7 litres per 100 kilometres to around 4.3 litres per 100 kilometres .
carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced from an average of 112 grams to approximately 103 grams per kilometre .
the diesel version has a fuel consumption of only 3.3 litres per 100 kilometres with a carbon dioxide emission figure of only 88 g / km .
after running a test with 100 electric-powered smarts in london , the car maker also announced the mass production of smart electric-drive for 2010 .
starting in early 2009 , the smart will also be available for the first time in china .
daimler ceo dieter zetsche says the smart is virtually custom-tailored to meet the growing demand for small cars in china .
summing up the late success of the smart , zetsche remarked : " had we not invented it 10 years ago , we would have to do so now . " dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.09.2008 berlin premieres magic dressing room mirror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magic mirror could appeal to men who find shopping for clothes a chore would n't it be nice if we could shop for clothes without having to try them on ?
that vision could soon become a reality thanks to the " virtual mirror " presented by german researchers at an electronics show in berlin . this mirror-like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button , according to the fraunhofer researchers at the ifa consumer electronics show in berlin .
there is more than a grain of truth in the old cliche that men hate shopping for clothes .
they find dressing rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
so scientists at the fraunhofer institute for telecommunications , heinrich-hertz-institut -lrb- hhi -rrb- , have developed a " magic mirror " that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virtual mirror concept was launched in an adidas flagship store all you have to do is to choose one shirt , and the virtual mirror will show how you would look wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
" the principle is similar to the virtual shoe-fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris , " says anna hilsmann of the hhi .
" but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t-shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . "
textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
these characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
summing up the scientific work required , anna hilsmann explains : " to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . "
visitors to the berlin electronics show were able to see for themselves how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same t-shirt .
technology not just for textiles so what does a stress-free fitting room look like ?
the customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
the camera registers the way their garment fits and flows and moves.the computer then " morphs " other styles of the same garment with the same folds and creases as the garment the person is actually wearing .
when the person moves and turns around , the image also moves and turns .
the shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
" shoes and clothes are just the first stage , " remarks hilsmann .
" the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewellery . " dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .
france currently holds the rotating eu council presidency .
negotiations in line with troop pull-out deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's shake on it : russia and the eu edge closer again under the peace plan agreed by russian president dmitry medvedev and his french counterpart nicholas sarkozy , moscow is to withdraw its troops by october 10 from the georgian mainland bordering the separatist regions south ossetia and abkhazia .
instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .
russia is set to sell 10 soyuz carrier rockets to the french arianespace company for up to $ 400 million under a deal signed in sochi with the roskosmos space aviation authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.09.2008 un warns world market slump may affect anti-poverty fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global financial crisis is already hindering un efforts at helping the world 's poor the un general assembly will review efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger next week , just as the world economy is slumping and high food prices have stripped the poor of their purchasing power . the summit at un headquarters in new york on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- on thursday takes place at a time the world 's biggest donors , like the united states and european nations , are struggling to prop up their failing economies and may no longer be able to assist the un with big checks .
the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .

the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.09.2008 un warns world market slump may affect anti-poverty fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global financial crisis is already hindering un efforts at helping the world 's poor the un general assembly will review efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger next week , just as the world economy is slumping and high food prices have stripped the poor of their purchasing power . the summit at un headquarters in new york on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- on thursday takes place at a time the world 's biggest donors , like the united states and european nations , are struggling to prop up their failing economies and may no longer be able to assist the un with big checks .
the un has asked those donors to increase development assistance by 18 billion dollars a year on top of their commitment to provide annually $ 50 billion to help poor countries .
the un said the commitment , made in 2005 by the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- , had not been met entirely , which would impede efforts to advance the mdgs , a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015 .
without additional funds between now and 2010 , the goal of ending poverty and hunger by 2015 looks grim .
among the other goals are making available universal primary education for all children , reversing the spread of hiv / aids , achieving gender equality and ending maternal and child mortality .
food crisis adds to soaring undernourishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people suffering from malnutrition has risen the un food and agriculture organization in rome said spiraling food prices since the summer have added 75 million people to the mass of 923 million undernourished people around the world reported last year .
soaring prices in fuel and fertilizer have aggravated living standards in poor regions , with food prices rising 52 percent between 2007 and 2008 , fao said .
the mdgs are an ambitious plan , with uneven achievements since it was launched in 2000 .
progress had been made , but not enough to reach the desired levels that would make a difference in poor countries .
ending poverty and hunger , a major goal in the entire plan , has been largely achieved in china because of its fast growing economy , but has failed in africa .
china has been able to lift more than 400 million people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty - now measured by the purchasing power of $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices .
the poverty rate in east asia fell from nearly 80 percent to 20 percent over a 25-year period , while it remained constant at 50 percent in sub-saharan africa over the same period .
more hiv / aids cases but more access to drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more hiv / aids sufferers are getting the drugs they need in the struggle to reverse the spread of hiv / aids , the un report said the number of people living with the aids virus has increased from 29.5 million in 2001 to 33 million in 2007 .
but 3 million infected people had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2007 , the highest number so far .
the vast majority of the 33 million aids infected people are in sub-saharan africa and 60 percent of them are adult women , the report said .
malaria killed an estimated 1 million people a year worldwide , 80 percent of them are children under five in sub-saharan africa .
there continue to be between 300 million and 500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year , the un said .
the goal of providing universal primary education for children has advanced , with the number of children out of school falling from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006 around the world .
sub-saharan africa has brought 71 percent of children into school .
the goal of reducing child mortality has also achieved some success , falling from 93 to 72 deaths per 1,000 children under 5 between 1990 and 2006 , the un said .
but 27 sub-saharan countries made no progress in reducing child deaths during that period .
childbirth still a great risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers in sub-saharan countries lack the necessary care one of the greatest disparities between sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world remained in the area of improving maternal health .
one of 22 african women risks dying of preventable pregnancy diseases and childbirth while the ratio is 1 in 7,300 women in the developed world .
in niger , one in 17 women risks dying of pregnancy-related causes , compared with one in 17,400 in sweden .
the report said 1 million african children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death .
alarmed by the slow progress in some of the targets for achievements by 2015 , un secretary general ban ki-moon has called for meetings and discussion on the fringes of the general assembly to step up activities .
" we face nothing less than a development emergency , " ban said of poverty eradication .
" halfway to the target date of 2015 , it is clear that we are not on track to meet the goals , especially in africa .
and the new global challenges - an economic slowdown , high food and fuel prices , and climate change - threaten to reverse the progress we have made .

kidnappers have been holding three journalists - a canadian , an australian and a somali - since august 23 and are reportedly demanding 2.5 million dollars to release them .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .
both european countries and the us were quick to denounce the incident . president george w bush said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by pakistan , the united states , and all those who stand against violent extremism . " german chancellor merkel said the fight against transnational terrorism remained a top priority for affected countries like pakistan and the international community . " germany will be continuing to support its partner pakistan in efforts for stability and prosperity , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family mourns the loss of a member at a local hospital in islamabad " the people behind this horrible act must be found and brought to justice and every form of support for the terrorists must be opposed , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a letter of condolence to his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi and released in berlin . " we can not say often enough that terror and violence must not be used as a tool in a political conflict , " he added , condemning the attack " in the strongest terms . " authorities in berlin say seven germans were wounded in the attack . speaking to sky news television , british prime minister gordon brown said saturday 's bombing was " completely inexcusable , the violence is completely unacceptable . " brown vowed that britain would do everything it could to help pakistan stamp out terrorism and added that he had discussed stepping up co-operation on counter-terrorism with pakistan president asif ali zardari . a statement from the european union presidency , currently held by france , said the eu would " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the north atlantic treaty organization on sunday called the act " grotesque . " nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer said nato remained committed to working with pakistan , including the new government , to combat the shared threat of violent extremism . reports suggest us marines were intended target media reports cited unnamed police officials as saying that a group of 30 us marines , who were allegedly part of a security team for this week 's visit of admiral mike mullen , chairman of us joint chiefs of staff committee , might have been the intended targets of the attacker . the us personnel were scheduled to leave for afghanistan on sunday morning , the private urdu-language aaj television channel said . hotel owner sadruddin hashwani said 39 victims , including three foreigners , were staff members .

" his death shows that the terrorists are trying to hit our most vulnerable spots .
we will not waver from our path : we will always stand up to evil and combat evil , " he said . he also denounced the attack as an attempt to destabilize pakistan in a crucial period after recent presidential elections . " if fundamentalism imposes itself in pakistan , the entire region will be destabilized , and that will have an impact also on the czech republic , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on czech television . the czech ambassador , who was married with two sons , was new to pakistan .
he assumed the post in august after four years in vietnam . pakistan suspects al-qaeda involvement there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack saturday at the five-star marriott hotel in islamabad , frequented by foreigners , which killed 53 people and injured 266 people , according to a toll announced sunday . but pakistani investigators have said the bombing was likely carried out by al-qaeda-linked taliban militants from tribal areas near the border with afghanistan . raging fire that completely destroyed the six-storey building held back the rescuers through the night before they could conduct room-to-room searches for survivors or bodies who died of suffocation or were burnt alive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast caused massive destruction and gutted cars parked outside the hotel pakistan television broadcast a video sunday of the bombing , showing that the attacker rammed the gates with his truck and then blew himself up minutes before the main blast .
top interior ministry official rehman malik told a news conference that the driver apparently believed his huge truck , which carried around one ton of explosives , would be able to crash through the security barriers . but the closed-circuit footage showed that it failed to get through a secondary barrier at the heavily-guarded hotel . the driver apparently could not convince the guards to let down that barrier and so then blew himself up .
in shock , the guards are seen hesitating for a few moments before racing to put out the fire from that explosion . the main explosion happened a few minutes later .
there is no footage of that because the blast destroyed the camera , malik said . the explosion shattered the windows of buildings and damaged structures near the hotel , which is located less than a kilometer from the residences of the prime minister and president . the hotel was popular with diplomats , foreigners and influential pakistani figures . worst attack in islamabad since 2001 saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . president zardari condemned the attack in a brief televised address to the nation early sunday .
" terrorism is an epidemic , a cancer which we will eliminate at all costs , " he said . he called pakistani a brave nation that would not be cowed by terrorist acts .
" pakistanis consider their lives a trust of allah almighty and have no fear of death as its day is fixed , " he said . merkel , bush , brown denounce attack the attack has sparked outrage around the world .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .
no one is in a position to predict an end to all this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 21.09.2008 german politicians wary of us financial rescue plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets are in a tailspin following big-ticket failures on wall street german politicians are skeptical about a $ 700 billion us bailout of markets and of calls to take similar measures as chancellor merkel criticized washington for failing to implement stringent market controls . a growing chorus of german politicians questioned over the weekend whether the unprecedented us rescue package meant to inject liquidity into the financial system would help to stem the crisis which has sent world markets into a tailspin . " i have doubts whether that method is really the most clever one , " michael meister , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether the chaos on wall street this week can be solved with taxpayers ' money meister suggested that the $ 700 billion bailout by the us government could lay the fundaments for the next crisis .
he compared it to the massive slashing of interest rates by the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 which he said had sowed the seeds for the current turbulence in capital markets . much like chancellor angela merkel , meister urged more regulation of financial markets .
it is important to think about measures such as banning speculation on falling shares rather than using taxpayers ' money , meister said . " i do n't think it 's appropriate that we use taxpayers ' money in germany to intervene in the markets , " he added . us wants other nations to set up similar plans on sunday , sept 21 , us treasury secretary henry paulson called for other nations to set up similar rescue plans . he did not provide further details , but us financial authorities have been working closely with their counterparts in europe and japan over the past 10 days to prevent a collapse of the interwoven global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other nations to set up similiar rescue plans " we have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and i believe a number of them will , " paulson said on the abc program " this week . " referring to paulson 's comments , joachim poss , deputy parliamentary head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said germany would not do the same . " the americans ca n't make germany accountable for their failure and their arrogance , " poss said .
" a similar rescue package is neither planned nor needed in germany , " he added . the sweeping bush administration bailout plan follows a bruising week that transformed wall street with lehman brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of merrill lynch & co and a government takeover of ailing insurer aig . it foresees the us treasury buying up bad mortgage-related debts from financial institutions to try to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could pull down economies around the world and stem the worst financial storm since the great depression . merkel slams us for failures on saturday , german chancellor merkel told a meeting of conservative politicians in linz , austria that it was irresponsible for the us to let major banking and credit institutions operate with too little government oversight . " it can not work like that on an international level , " merkel said . merkel said that she had tried to win support for greater transparency and regulation on international markets at the g-8 conference last year , but that governments including the us did not heed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been bluntly critical of us failures in the current crisis germany had expressed fears that hedge funds could threaten the stability of the financial system through their heavy reliance on borrowing to finance risky trading strategies .
it has also raised concerns about private equity funds .
in a separate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets . " i criticize the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said .
" on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " the chancellor also reiterated calls for tighter regulation of financial markets . " europe must see to it that we get more transparency on financial markets , clear rules and that crises such as the current one are n't repeated , " she said . in the face of the latest financial storm and a global credit crunch , experts have lowered their economic growth estimates for germany and europe next year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but have you felt the shockwaves that have swept financial markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb 's juergen stark juergen stark : of course .
here in europe , we 're feeling the shockwaves primarily caused by problems in the us .
it 's been going on for months now and recently we 've had a new shockwave that we 've had to respond to .
but we 've acted decisively with other central banks to inject fresh liquidity into markets .
did the crisis surprise you ?
i think we need to make a distinction here .
over the past few years there have been excesses and market corrections were necessary .
and only when those corrections have started can we ask how this whole process will develop .
here at the european central bank we warned about the risks which in our opinion were not properly assessed by market players .
and in an environment where low interest rates and low inflation prevailed , banks were naturally inclined to seek higher returns .
there was a race for high returns and in that race the banks took high risks .
and those risks are now materializing .
do you think us regulators were asleep at the helm ?
i would n't like to pin the blame solely on us authorities .
i think there are many here in europe who contributed to the situation , primarily in the risk management departments of banks .
so does risk management need to be improved ?
i think there 's consensus among banks and among regulators that it is an important element that needs to be improved .
what can the ecb do to calm markets ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaotic scenes at the new york stock exchange last week first of all , we need to work to ensure that the nervousness and - in parts - panic does n't spill over into central banks .
and i think we here at the ecb are equipped with a clear mandate and a clear monetary strategy to overcome the problems .
what we 've done since august of last year - and we 're in the 13th month of this process - is put more liquidity at banks ' disposal .
the inter-bank lending market - that is where banks lend among themselves - had seized up .
so you threw money at the market ?
to solve the liquidity problem , we temporarily made funds available to banks backed by collateral .
it will not be an ongoing phenomenon - so there is no danger of it sparking off inflationary pressure .
on one day alone you made 70 billion euros available .
did that have the effect you had predicted ?
it 's true that we did make an additional 70 billion euros available to banks - but only for 24 hours and only if the borrowing was backed by collateral .
but as we saw in august and september last year , trust among banks towards each other has been greatly eroded .
they do n't know how many potential risks are lying in the books of other banks .
so institutions have begun to hoard liquid funds - and not pass them on to other banks .
but that does n't help ...
but it does .
because we help banks who otherwise would n't have access to liquidity on the normal market , to get hold of it .
people in europe have the feeling that consumers here are having to pay for the sins of americans , due to the domino effect of the crisis .
what do you think of that ?
first of all , there is no domino effect .
what we 're seeing in this latest phase of turbulence on capital markets are structural re-adjustments .
it 's normal in an economy for market players who can no longer stick it out , to leave the game .
but some of those players are solid banks who are now at risk .
of course yes , i was talking about the past .
we 're living in uncertain times and nobody knows what will happen in the next days and weeks .
we 're feeling the shockwaves and ripples , but there 's no need to be worried in europe .
it 's a process that was sparked off in the us and has now reached the shores of britain .
but i can say that the german banking system - the euro-zone banking system - entered this process with strong profitability and capitalization .
but can you understand why people in europe are worried ?
they are phoning banks and asking if their money is safe .
it 's understandable on a psychological level ... but once again , there 's no reason to worry .
how closely is the ecb working with the us federal reserve in this crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is working closely with the fed to inject more liquidity in markets we are in continuous contact in the usual bilateral bodies but we 're also looking more closely at what 's happening in the us right now .
what we did this week was work in closer cooperation with other central banks and act as an agent of the fed to inject more dollar liquidity into the market which had seized up .
american banks hoarded dollar reserves with the effect that foreign banks could not access them .
dollars became scarce .
so we and other central banks reached an agreement with the fed so that we would act as agents of the fed and put dollars on the market .
and i think it 's a sign of the level of trust that among central banks during this critical period .
so the us needs europe to cope with this crisis ?
it 's in the interest of our banks to be able to do business in dollars and that is the basis of our cooperation .
are we at the end of the crisis ?
what we are experiencing here are the after-shocks of the credit crunch that rocked america .
it 's been 13 months since it started and total losses and write-downs amount to some 500 billion dollars so far .
and i do n't know what is yet to come .
the whole financial sector is going through a clean-out and it will last some time .

coach juergen klinsmann however , refused to drown his post-match sorrows . munich boss franz beckenbauer told coach juergen klinsmann after saturday 's debacle to drown his sorrows at the famed beerfest which opened the same day .
" i do n't envy you , have a few beers at the wiesn -lrb- the beerfest -rrb- tonight , " beckenbauer said after the game .
but klinsmann would have none of it : " i take any advice from franz , but this one i wo n't . "
klinsmann needed a clear head , after all , to analyse the first season defeat of the champions which in the sunday papers was drew headlines such as " klinsi-disaster " and " klinsi-catastrophe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann was infuriated but refused to turn to drink goalkeeper michael rensing , the new number one between the posts after oliver kahn 's retirement , did not look good on several occasions .
the defensive line around martin demichelis and lucio was outplayed by a bremen team led by two-time scorer markus rosenberg and teenager masut ozil , who scored one and set up two others .
once bremen raced off to a 5-0 lead midway through the second half there were haunting memories of munich 's worst ever home defeat , a 7-0 loss against schalke in october 1976 .

klinsmann , 44 , has completely overhauled munich 's training regime and personnel .
he is condemned to win titles and is convinced that saturday 's performance will not be repeated .
" we suffered a big blow .
you have to admit that the opponent was better and tought us a lesson .
now we have to learn from that . "
" we have hit the ground .
but we will get up again and become even stronger , " vowed klinsmann .
" bremen were the better team , most of all because they were ruthless with their chances .
they hit us with the next blow every time we were finding our way back .
" unfortunately , we came up short of what was needed to win the game , but the team will be very self-critical when dealing with this defeat and then we 'll look to the future , " klinsmann added .

after moscow 's full withdrawal , there would be no more reason to halt the talks which the eu had put on hold after the war between russia and georgia over the separatist region of south ossetia , said fillon .

instead , 200 eu observers are planned to maintain security in georgia 's mainland .
putin said the deployment of about 3,800 troops each in abkhazia and south ossetia was based on a friendship treaty with russia .
the russian soldiers in these regions - recognized by moscow as independent countries after the war - were to prevent the attack of georgian troops .
speaking on the other issues , putin said russia and france had agreed to cooperate more closely in the field of space technology in future .
the two countries could join in developing a new spaceship , putin said , adding that about 250 russian experts were already working at the space station in kourou , itar-tass reported .
the two countries also agreed on increased programs for youth exchanges as well as a " strategic partnership " in education and research .
russia is set to sell 10 soyuz carrier rockets to the french arianespace company for up to $ 400 million under a deal signed in sochi with the roskosmos space aviation authority .
the first soyuz rocket was due to start by the end of 2009 , arianespace general director jean-yves le gall said .
climate and energy agreements signed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and russia agreed on energy and climate issues on the sidelines of the sochi talks , political and business delegates from the two countries also inked an agreement on cooperation in the fields of environmental and climate protection as well as energy efficiency .

brecon beacons national park authority is aiming to cut the time taken to process applications following claims it was taking up to eight months .
the authority has faced heavy criticism in recent months over its handling of an application for a caravan park .
its chief executive was suspended on 15 september while an investigation into its management is carried out .
the new planning system called 1app will be introduced on 1 october .
park officials have met with planning agents , major landowners and developers to discuss the process . "
hopefully , it will minimise the risk that we will have to go back to applicant " park head of planning , chris morgan in march , companies claimed they were losing money because the national park was taking up to eight months to process applications , instead of between eight and 13 weeks .
chris morgan , the park authority 's head of planning , said the new system would help developers and residents .
he added : " this means that this authority will have all the information it needs in order to determine the application in a shorter period of time .
" hopefully , it will minimise the risk that we will have to go back to applicant to ask for more information , therefore reducing the amount of time it takes us to reach a decision . "
he advised applicants , though , to read the park 's new planning guidelines .
tim organ , who with his son sam runs design consultants co2 , met with the park officials at a meeting held over planning concerns .
he said : " some of the initiatives the park is introducing , such as lowering the time applications are dealt with , bringing its system in line with a national strategy and a new sustainable guide , are good .
" but i still have some reservations about the culture of negativity in the planning department , particularly towards architecture , as opposed to building . "
on 15 september , mr gledhill was suspended for up to two months while an investigation is carried out into the way the authority is managed .
the park said the suspension was " not an indication of wrong-doing " .
earlier this year , an inquiry found " serious failings " with a planning application for a caravan park at gilestone farm in talybont-on-usk , near brecon .

they will be included in the criminal justice and licensing bill which will be introduced to the scottish parliament later this year .
the aim of the new measures is to attack the financial bases of criminal empires .
among the offences and measures outlined are : directing or controlling serious organised crime or being involved in it failing to report , or knowingly living off serious organised criminal activity new arrangements for police surveillance to cut bureaucracy which can delay operations justice secretary kenny macaskill said apart from targeting those directly involved in serious organised crime , the measures would mean the crime bosses behind it would also now be vulnerable .
the bill will enable courts to convict even those who are not engaged in day-to-day criminal activities , and professionals such as accountants and lawyers who turn a blind eye to serious crime .
mr macaskill said the government was determined to take on criminal empires , to ensure they could no longer be able to operate with impunity .
speaking ahead of monday 's latest meeting of the scottish government 's serious organised crime taskforce , he said : " the criminal godfathers , their lieutenants and foot soldiers who prey on our citizens should be under no illusion that this government is determined to put them out of business .

they will be included in the criminal justice and licensing bill which will be introduced to the scottish parliament later this year .
the aim of the new measures is to attack the financial bases of criminal empires .
among the offences and measures outlined are : directing or controlling serious organised crime or being involved in it failing to report , or knowingly living off serious organised criminal activity new arrangements for police surveillance to cut bureaucracy which can delay operations justice secretary kenny macaskill said apart from targeting those directly involved in serious organised crime , the measures would mean the crime bosses behind it would also now be vulnerable .
the bill will enable courts to convict even those who are not engaged in day-to-day criminal activities , and professionals such as accountants and lawyers who turn a blind eye to serious crime .
mr macaskill said the government was determined to take on criminal empires , to ensure they could no longer be able to operate with impunity .
speaking ahead of monday 's latest meeting of the scottish government 's serious organised crime taskforce , he said : " the criminal godfathers , their lieutenants and foot soldiers who prey on our citizens should be under no illusion that this government is determined to put them out of business . "
he added : " this government is determined to take them on and take them down . "

" a 45-year-old man was arrested on 19 september on suspicion of possession of drugs in the hampstead heath area , " a metropolitan police spokesman said .
the singer was taken to a police station and given the caution for possessing class a and class c drugs .
home office minister tony mcnulty said drug laws needed to be " flexible " .
asked why michael had been given a relatively mild punishment for the possession of class a drugs , mr mcnulty said he did not know the details of the case .

george michael has been in trouble with police before but he added that the law provides a wide range of punishments for possession of drugs , and " circumstances and context " had to be applied .
the home office website says possession of class a drugs can result in up to seven years in prison , an unlimited fine or both .
mr mcnulty told the bbc : " the biggest message is that drugs are wrong and people will be punished , but it must be right that there is flexiblity in the law . "
but the government has the balance " about right " between being tough when it needs to be and providing treatment for individuals " to get off that horrible spiral of drug dependancy and crime " , he added .
' quieter life ' last month , george michael completed his 25 live world tour , his first for 15 years .
after performing " final " dates at london 's earls court and in copenhagen , michael said he would be retiring from arena and stadium shows .
he said he would leave the " bells and whistles " of large-scale tours behind after the tour because he wanted a " quieter life " .
during the concerts , he performed his hit outside in a police uniform in a jokey reference to previous arrests .
the song itself referred to his arrest in 1998 when he was detained by an undercover police officer for lewd conduct in a public toilet in beverly hills , california .
until that time he had not " come out " in public , but the arrest and subsequent conviction forced him to reveal his homosexuality and his relationship with american kenny goss .
michael also came into conflict with the law in october 2006 when he was found slumped over the wheel of his car .
and last may he was given a two-year driving ban after pleading guilty to driving while unfit through drugs .
earlier this year , the 45-year-old singer signed a multi-million pound deal with publisher harpercollins to write his autobiography , which he said would be a " no-holds barred " account of his life .
and during his final shows on stage , he revealed that he had written a christmas song which would be released this december - his first festive song since wham ! 's last christmas , initially released in 1984 .

george michael has been in trouble with police before but he added that the law provides a wide range of punishments for possession of drugs , and " circumstances and context " had to be applied .
the home office website says possession of class a drugs can result in up to seven years in prison , an unlimited fine or both .
mr mcnulty told the bbc : " the biggest message is that drugs are wrong and people will be punished , but it must be right that there is flexiblity in the law . "
but the government has the balance " about right " between being tough when it needs to be and providing treatment for individuals " to get off that horrible spiral of drug dependancy and crime " , he added .
' quieter life ' last month , george michael completed his 25 live world tour , his first for 15 years .
after performing " final " dates at london 's earls court and in copenhagen , michael said he would be retiring from arena and stadium shows .
he said he would leave the " bells and whistles " of large-scale tours behind after the tour because he wanted a " quieter life " .
during the concerts , he performed his hit outside in a police uniform in a jokey reference to previous arrests .
the song itself referred to his arrest in 1998 when he was detained by an undercover police officer for lewd conduct in a public toilet in beverly hills , california .

and last may he was given a two-year driving ban after pleading guilty to driving while unfit through drugs .
earlier this year , the 45-year-old singer signed a multi-million pound deal with publisher harpercollins to write his autobiography , which he said would be a " no-holds barred " account of his life .
and during his final shows on stage , he revealed that he had written a christmas song which would be released this december - his first festive song since wham ! 's last christmas , initially released in 1984 .

they will be included in the criminal justice and licensing bill which will be introduced to the scottish parliament later this year .
the aim of the new measures is to attack the financial bases of criminal empires .
among the offences and measures outlined are : directing or controlling serious organised crime or being involved in it failing to report , or knowingly living off serious organised criminal activity new arrangements for police surveillance to cut bureaucracy which can delay operations justice secretary kenny macaskill said apart from targeting those directly involved in serious organised crime , the measures would mean the crime bosses behind it would also now be vulnerable .
the bill will enable courts to convict even those who are not engaged in day-to-day criminal activities , and professionals such as accountants and lawyers who turn a blind eye to serious crime .
mr macaskill said the government was determined to take on criminal empires , to ensure they could no longer be able to operate with impunity .
speaking ahead of monday 's latest meeting of the scottish government 's serious organised crime taskforce , he said : " the criminal godfathers , their lieutenants and foot soldiers who prey on our citizens should be under no illusion that this government is determined to put them out of business . "
he added : " this government is determined to take them on and take them down . "

a star is born george michael was born yorgos kyriakou panayiotou on 25 june , 1963 .
he is the son of greek cypriot restaurant owner jack and mum lesley .
described as a " shy , podgy , bespectacled child " , he sat next to andrew ridgley on his first day at secondary school in bushey , hertfordshire .
the pair played in a short-lived ska band called the executive in 1979 .
they formed wham ! and were signed after sending a demo tape to record label innervision , a small subsidiary of cbs , in 1981 .
at that time , he changed his name .
" i have never felt any ethnic connection between the greeks and me other than how hairy i am , " he said .
the pair stepped in at the last minute to perform their second single young guns -lrb- go for it ! -rrb- on top of the pops after another act pulled out .
the performance pushed the song into the top 40 and it became their first hit , eventually rising to number three .
their manager simon napier-bell previously managed the yardbirds and marc bolan , and co-wrote dusty springfield hit you do n't have to say you love me .
napier-bell later wrote of the band 's appeal : " they looked like siblings , dressed as if they were on a holiday of a lifetime , and had a beguiling homoerotic intimacy . "
in 1983 , pepsi de macque replaced backing dancer dc lee to form a partnership with existing dancer shirlie holliman .
debut album fantastic hit number one in the uk , while global success was achieved with aptly-titled second album make it big , which reached number one in the us .
in april 1985 , in front of 15,000 teenagers at the people 's gymnasium in beijing , wham ! became the first western pop group to perform in communist china .
after a string of hits , the band split up in 1986 when michael was 23 .
they reportedly sold 20 million albums and between 10 and 15 million singles .
" the fact that he did n't contribute anything must have been a terrible blow to his ego , " he said about ridgley after the split .
solo success michael 's first solo single careless whisper , released in 1984 while wham ! were still together , sold six million copies worldwide .
his first single after wham ! , i want your sex , was banned before 9pm by the bbc because it " encourages young girls to participate in sex " .
it went on to reach number three in the uk and number two in the us .
his debut solo album faith sold more than 10 million copies and earned michael a best album grammy in 1988 .
the follow-up , listen without prejudice vol 1 , contained five singles , but a video was made for just one - freedom ' 90 .
even then , michael did not appear in the video himself , instead enlisting a slew of supermodels .
he fell out spectacularly with his record company sony in 1994 and tried to get himself released from his contract , which he called " professional slavery " .
a three-month court case ensued , which michael eventually lost , forcing him to fulfil his contractual commitments and record two more songs to be used on a greatest hits album .
private turmoil in 1991 , michael met lover brazilian anselmo feleppa .
the two struck up a close relationship until he lost mr feleppa to aids two years later .
" anyone who knew me before i met anselmo would tell you that he opened me up completely - just in allowing myself to trust my intuition , " the singer said later .
the song jesus to a child was a tribute to feleppa .
he has said he took the loss of mr feleppa and then his mother lesley in 1997 " very badly " and that it led to " a period of kind of semi-hibernation " .
he was outed as homosexual after propositioning an undercover police officer in a public toilet in los angeles in 1998 .
his arrest and subsequent conviction for lewd conduct resulted in a $ 450 fine and 80 hours community service .
he later told q magazine that " running naked up and down oxford street singing i am what i am would have been a more dignified way to come out " .
he made light of the incident on his single outside , which was a hit later that year .
he became open about his sexuality and has been in a relationship with kenny goss for more than a decade .
michael has spoken about the open nature of the relationship , and has admitted seeking " anonymous and no-strings sex " on london 's hampstead heath .
solo return in 2002 , he released the single shoot the dog , a political satire with a video showing tony blair as george bush 's poodle .
he also recorded a cover version of don mclean 's anti-war song the grave as a protest against military action in iraq .
in 2004 , the superstar released his first new album for eight years , patience .
two years later , he embarked on first tour for 15 years and was the first performer to play at the new wembley stadium in london .
drugs , police and the future he has made no secret of his use of marijuana , resulting in a number of scrapes with the law in recent years .
he was twice cautioned for possessing cannabis after being found asleep at the wheel of his car on two separate occasions in 2006 .
the same year , he was seen lighting what appeared to be a cannabis joint on a south bank show special , saying : " this stuff keeps me sane and happy . "
he told desert island discs his marijuana use could be " a problem " and said he is " constantly trying " to smoke less of the drug .
as a result of one of the incidents , he was also sentenced to 100 hours of community service and banned from driving for two years .
in 2007 , he was also in the headlines after being accused of colliding with three parked cars and driving off without notifying the owners .
this summer , he said he wanted " a quieter life " out of the public eye and played his " final two " major concerts at earls court in london .
his plans for a quieter life have not lasted long - he has been cautioned for possession of class a and class c drugs after being arrested in a public toilet .

a star is born george michael was born yorgos kyriakou panayiotou on 25 june , 1963 .
he is the son of greek cypriot restaurant owner jack and mum lesley .
described as a " shy , podgy , bespectacled child " , he sat next to andrew ridgley on his first day at secondary school in bushey , hertfordshire .
the pair played in a short-lived ska band called the executive in 1979 .
they formed wham ! and were signed after sending a demo tape to record label innervision , a small subsidiary of cbs , in 1981 .
at that time , he changed his name .
" i have never felt any ethnic connection between the greeks and me other than how hairy i am , " he said .
the pair stepped in at the last minute to perform their second single young guns -lrb- go for it ! -rrb- on top of the pops after another act pulled out .
the performance pushed the song into the top 40 and it became their first hit , eventually rising to number three .
wham ! only released nine singles in their four-year career their manager simon napier-bell previously managed the yardbirds and marc bolan , and co-wrote dusty springfield hit you do n't have to say you love me .
napier-bell later wrote of the band 's appeal : " they looked like siblings , dressed as if they were on a holiday of a lifetime , and had a beguiling homoerotic intimacy . "
in 1983 , pepsi de macque replaced backing dancer dc lee to form a partnership with existing dancer shirlie holliman .
debut album fantastic hit number one in the uk , while global success was achieved with aptly-titled second album make it big , which reached number one in the us .
in april 1985 , in front of 15,000 teenagers at the people 's gymnasium in beijing , wham ! became the first western pop group to perform in communist china .
after a string of hits , the band split up in 1986 when michael was 23 .
they reportedly sold 20 million albums and between 10 and 15 million singles .
" the fact that he did n't contribute anything must have been a terrible blow to his ego , " he said about ridgley after the split .
solo success michael 's first solo single careless whisper , released in 1984 while wham ! were still together , sold six million copies worldwide .
his first single after wham ! , i want your sex , was banned before 9pm by the bbc because it " encourages young girls to participate in sex " .

his debut solo album faith sold more than 10 million copies and earned michael a best album grammy in 1988 .
the follow-up , listen without prejudice vol 1 , contained five singles , but a video was made for just one - freedom ' 90 .
even then , michael did not appear in the video himself , instead enlisting a slew of supermodels .
he fell out spectacularly with his record company sony in 1994 and tried to get himself released from his contract , which he called " professional slavery " .
a three-month court case ensued , which michael eventually lost , forcing him to fulfil his contractual commitments and record two more songs to be used on a greatest hits album .
private turmoil michael wrote the song amazing for his partner , kenny goss in 1991 , michael met lover brazilian anselmo feleppa .
the two struck up a close relationship until he lost mr feleppa to aids two years later .
" anyone who knew me before i met anselmo would tell you that he opened me up completely - just in allowing myself to trust my intuition , " the singer said later .
the song jesus to a child was a tribute to feleppa .
he has said he took the loss of mr feleppa and then his mother lesley in 1997 " very badly " and that it led to " a period of kind of semi-hibernation " .
he was outed as homosexual after propositioning an undercover police officer in a public toilet in los angeles in 1998 .
his arrest and subsequent conviction for lewd conduct resulted in a $ 450 fine and 80 hours community service .
he later told q magazine that " running naked up and down oxford street singing i am what i am would have been a more dignified way to come out " .
he made light of the incident on his single outside , which was a hit later that year .
he became open about his sexuality and has been in a relationship with kenny goss for more than a decade .
michael has spoken about the open nature of the relationship , and has admitted seeking " anonymous and no-strings sex " on london 's hampstead heath .
solo return the star will retire from touring once his 25 live concerts end in 2002 , he released the single shoot the dog , a political satire with a video showing tony blair as george bush 's poodle .
he also recorded a cover version of don mclean 's anti-war song the grave as a protest against military action in iraq .
in 2004 , the superstar released his first new album for eight years , patience .
two years later , he embarked on first tour for 15 years and was the first performer to play at the new wembley stadium in london .

michael was the first artist to perform at the new wembley stadium in 2007 he was twice cautioned for possessing cannabis after being found asleep at the wheel of his car on two separate occasions in 2006 .
the same year , he was seen lighting what appeared to be a cannabis joint on a south bank show special , saying : " this stuff keeps me sane and happy . "
he told desert island discs his marijuana use could be " a problem " and said he is " constantly trying " to smoke less of the drug .
as a result of one of the incidents , he was also sentenced to 100 hours of community service and banned from driving for two years .
in 2007 , he was also in the headlines after being accused of colliding with three parked cars and driving off without notifying the owners .

he is the son of greek cypriot restaurant owner jack and mum lesley .
described as a " shy , podgy , bespectacled child " , he sat next to andrew ridgley on his first day at secondary school in bushey , hertfordshire .
the pair played in a short-lived ska band called the executive in 1979 .
they formed wham ! and were signed after sending a demo tape to record label innervision , a small subsidiary of cbs , in 1981 .
at that time , he changed his name .
" i have never felt any ethnic connection between the greeks and me other than how hairy i am , " he said .
the pair stepped in at the last minute to perform their second single young guns -lrb- go for it ! -rrb- on top of the pops after another act pulled out .
the performance pushed the song into the top 40 and it became their first hit , eventually rising to number three .
wham ! only released nine singles in their four-year career their manager simon napier-bell previously managed the yardbirds and marc bolan , and co-wrote dusty springfield hit you do n't have to say you love me .
napier-bell later wrote of the band 's appeal : " they looked like siblings , dressed as if they were on a holiday of a lifetime , and had a beguiling homoerotic intimacy . "
in 1983 , pepsi de macque replaced backing dancer dc lee to form a partnership with existing dancer shirlie holliman .
debut album fantastic hit number one in the uk , while global success was achieved with aptly-titled second album make it big , which reached number one in the us .
in april 1985 , in front of 15,000 teenagers at the people 's gymnasium in beijing , wham ! became the first western pop group to perform in communist china .
after a string of hits , the band split up in 1986 when michael was 23 .
they reportedly sold 20 million albums and between 10 and 15 million singles .
" the fact that he did n't contribute anything must have been a terrible blow to his ego , " he said about ridgley after the split .
solo success michael 's first solo single careless whisper , released in 1984 while wham ! were still together , sold six million copies worldwide .
his first single after wham ! , i want your sex , was banned before 9pm by the bbc because it " encourages young girls to participate in sex " .
it went on to reach number three in the uk and number two in the us .
his debut solo album faith sold more than 10 million copies and earned michael a best album grammy in 1988 .
the follow-up , listen without prejudice vol 1 , contained five singles , but a video was made for just one - freedom ' 90 .
even then , michael did not appear in the video himself , instead enlisting a slew of supermodels .
he fell out spectacularly with his record company sony in 1994 and tried to get himself released from his contract , which he called " professional slavery " .
a three-month court case ensued , which michael eventually lost , forcing him to fulfil his contractual commitments and record two more songs to be used on a greatest hits album .
private turmoil michael wrote the song amazing for his partner , kenny goss in 1991 , michael met lover brazilian anselmo feleppa .
the two struck up a close relationship until he lost mr feleppa to aids two years later .
" anyone who knew me before i met anselmo would tell you that he opened me up completely - just in allowing myself to trust my intuition , " the singer said later .
the song jesus to a child was a tribute to feleppa .
he has said he took the loss of mr feleppa and then his mother lesley in 1997 " very badly " and that it led to " a period of kind of semi-hibernation " .
he was outed as homosexual after propositioning an undercover police officer in a public toilet in los angeles in 1998 .
his arrest and subsequent conviction for lewd conduct resulted in a $ 450 fine and 80 hours community service .
he later told q magazine that " running naked up and down oxford street singing i am what i am would have been a more dignified way to come out " .
he made light of the incident on his single outside , which was a hit later that year .
he became open about his sexuality and has been in a relationship with kenny goss for more than a decade .
michael has spoken about the open nature of the relationship , and has admitted seeking " anonymous and no-strings sex " on london 's hampstead heath .
solo return the star will retire from touring once his 25 live concerts end in 2002 , he released the single shoot the dog , a political satire with a video showing tony blair as george bush 's poodle .
he also recorded a cover version of don mclean 's anti-war song the grave as a protest against military action in iraq .
in 2004 , the superstar released his first new album for eight years , patience .
two years later , he embarked on first tour for 15 years and was the first performer to play at the new wembley stadium in london .
drugs , police and the future he has made no secret of his use of marijuana , resulting in a number of scrapes with the law in recent years .
michael was the first artist to perform at the new wembley stadium in 2007 he was twice cautioned for possessing cannabis after being found asleep at the wheel of his car on two separate occasions in 2006 .
the same year , he was seen lighting what appeared to be a cannabis joint on a south bank show special , saying : " this stuff keeps me sane and happy . "
he told desert island discs his marijuana use could be " a problem " and said he is " constantly trying " to smoke less of the drug .
as a result of one of the incidents , he was also sentenced to 100 hours of community service and banned from driving for two years .
in 2007 , he was also in the headlines after being accused of colliding with three parked cars and driving off without notifying the owners .
this summer , he said he wanted " a quieter life " out of the public eye and played his " final two " major concerts at earls court in london .
his plans for a quieter life have not lasted long - he has been cautioned for possession of class a and class c drugs after being arrested in a public toilet .

sir george mathewson described the loss of hbos as an independent company as " very sad " and warned this would be damaging to scotland 's position as a financial centre .
sir george was the royal bank 's chief executive from 1992 until 2001 .
during his time , rbs bought the national westminster bank and became the first scottish company to make a profit of more than £ 1bn .
speaking to the business programme on bbc radio scotland , sir george said : " much as i have spent many years in fierce competition with the bank of scotland , i deeply regret effectively its passing as an independent company . "
he added : " it 's difficult to see how it can not be very damaging to edinburgh and to scotland , to scotland 's position as a financial centre and basically in terms of the serious jobs lost within the city and all that follows on from that in terms of houses , critical mass etc .
" it 's the fact there are decision-makers located in scotland , it 's the part in the life of the city and in the contribution to everything , government etc .
i think that 's a great loss to the scottish infrastructure . "
sir george also feared the combination of hbos and lloyds tsb would prove to be bad for the public .
the two companies have 38 million customers between them .
he said : " how bad is a question mark but you have to stand and say , in general , when you lose big players who are satisfying the market , it 's not a good thing . "
' ridiculous claims ' lloyds tsb struck a £ 12bn deal to buy hbos on thursday .
hbos shareholders will get £ 2.32 a share .
this means shareholders who took up extra shares in a rights issue earlier this year will have lost out .
the companies have still not said how many jobs will go , although claims by unions that up to 40,000 jobs will be lost have been dismissed as " ridiculous " .
there are also concerns about possible branch closures .
in scotland alone , bank of scotland has more than 300 branches while lloyds tsb has 185 .
however the companies have said the bank of scotland 's separate banknotes and historic headquarters on the mound in edinburgh will remain .
hbos shares have fallen in value by more than 80 % over the past year .
its share price collapsed at the start of last week and as late as tuesday , hbos was reassuring investors and customers that its financing was sound .
some have blamed the collapse of the share price on short-selling - a practice whereby traders make money by betting on falls in share prices .
first minister alex salmond described the people who brought about the fall in hbos ' share price as " spivs and speculators " .
the financial services authority has now temporarily banned the short-selling of stocks in leading financial companies .
however others argue that hbos had been pursuing a flawed strategy and that short-selling was only partly to blame .
