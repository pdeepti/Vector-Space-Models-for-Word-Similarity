since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .

30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .
" we must always take sides , " he told his audience .

the 2-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- project is set for completion in 2012 . vattenfall says the modern plant will release 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of output , 200 grams less than older coal-fired plants .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .

30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .
monday 's final reading was the lowest in more than two years on the frankfurt exchange .
on monday , london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares sank 2.63 percent to 4,954.11 points in early morning trade , accelerating opening losses .
in paris , the cac 40 slid 2.82 percent to 4,046.17 points .
stock markets across the nordic region too plummeted monday .
the oslo stock exchange fell 8.30 percent by the closing to 301.84 points , its lowest level in nearly three years .
the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "
sarkozy urges support for banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called emergency meetings to curtail the crisis french president nicolas sarkozy attempted monday to rally support for assisting ailing european banks ahead of a meeting at the elysee presidential palace to review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses in france .
" we must not give way in the face of destabilization , we must help our banks , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating european presidency .
appearing with the french president , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said " initiatives " were in preparation for a " structural european response " to the crisis to be unveiled at a european summit in mid-october .
" that 's the only way to ensure that stability and confidence can return , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" slovenia 's government has expressed concern over what is seen as its neighbor 's embrace of far-right parties .
" the result of elections in austria is surprising and worthy of concern to some extent , particularly in those cases that represent a rejection of european values , " slovenia 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
the vote was a major win for austria 's two far-right parties which campaigned on an anti-immigration platform .
both the freedom party and alliance for the future of austria have promised to defend the rights of " true austrians . "
disappointed with politics the british press also expressed its dismay over the turn of events .
the populist daily mail described the far-right gains as " deeply disturbing , " saying it offered an " unsettling reminder of austria 's nazi past . "
but the daily mail as well as right-leaning daily telegraph viewed the results as an example of a broken political system , not a return to fascism .
" voters like a choice between sensible parties , " the daily telegraph wrote .
" when they do n't get it , they will vote for silly ones . "
main parties to form coalition the social democrats and the conservative people 's party saw their support eroded , although they would still have enough votes to form a coalition .
yet it was the main parties ' failed left-right coalition that doomed the current government .
the social democrats remain the strongest party despite heavy losses .
party head werner faymann said he would seek to form a coalition with the people 's party even though differences between the two centrist parties had triggered early elections .
joerg haider , the leader of the right-wing alliance for the future of austria , has said he would be prepared to join a new government with the conservatives . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .

" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

but will the strong words have any effect ? in an unusually strong statement , the european union has called american lawmakers to order for failing to reach agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to shore up foundering financial institutions and markets .
" the us must take its responsibility in this situation , must show statesmanship for the sake of their own companies and for the sake of the world , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said us lawmakers had " taken leave of their senses " in their failure to pass the rescue measure .
" i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington , " mandelson said in an interview with the bbc .
german chancellor angela merkel urged the us to support the measure , saying its quick passage " is the precondition for creating new confidence on the markets " and " of incredibly great significance . "
the statements came after the us house of representatives narrowly rejected the bailout plan on monday , september 29 .
bildunterschrift : the bailout failure was dramatic - and potentially devastating much of the world , as well as the bush administration , had assumed that representatives would pass the package .
but many members of the house from both parties , fearful of repercussions from voters in november 's national elections , refused to support it .
europe as an example ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dexia became the latest european victim of the financial crisis " all the necessary measures will be taken to preserve the interests of dexia 's depositors , " belgian prime minister yves leterme said .
" our ambition was to have very strong political involvement in order to send a signal to the markets . "
the dexia bailout came just hours after the netherlands , belgium and luxemburg agreed to partially nationalize banking giant fortis , supplying some 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- .
on monday , the german government too provided the country 's second largest commercial property lender , hypo real estate holding , a line of credit of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also been busy urging top banks to keep credit lines open to the french economy .
markets on a knife edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets all over the globe are jittery the dexia bailout became necessary after the bank 's stock plummeted nearly 30 percent on monday , reaching an all-time low .
and tuesday was another roller-coaster ride for european stock market brokers .
all the major european indexes opened with dramatic losses , as investors expressed their disappointment at the us failure to agree upon the bailout plan .
but markets rebounded during the course of the day amidst hope that us lawmakers would ultimately be forced to intervene to stop the crisis .

" i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington , " mandelson said in an interview with the bbc .
german chancellor angela merkel urged the us to support the measure , saying its quick passage " is the precondition for creating new confidence on the markets " and " of incredibly great significance . "
the statements came after the us house of representatives narrowly rejected the bailout plan on monday , september 29 .
bildunterschrift : the bailout failure was dramatic - and potentially devastating much of the world , as well as the bush administration , had assumed that representatives would pass the package .
but many members of the house from both parties , fearful of repercussions from voters in november 's national elections , refused to support it .

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .

but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .

concern has been growing among german exporters at the clouding of the global economy .
but the recent turmoil on financial markets has not translated into any significant layoffs in germany . " unemployment is falling and the number of jobs is continuing to rise , " federal labor office chief frank-juergen weise said .
demand for staff remained fairly high . the politically more important unadjusted tally was 3.081 million , down 115,000 from august as hiring increased after germany 's summer vacations . that brought the unadjusted joblessness rate down 0.2 of a percentage point to 7.4 per cent . german labor minister olaf scholz hailed the unadjusted tally as germany 's best since 1992 , attributing it to job-creation policy .
he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .
the september seasonally-unadjusted tally was 463,000 less than in the same month last year . however a spokesman for one of the opposition parties in berlin , rainer bruederle of the free democrat party , dismissed the brighter joblessness figure as " just a lull before the storm .

" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .

" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .

" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 30.09.2008 france embraces nuclear cooperation with india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is split on using nuclear power the european union and india ended their summit with the eu agreeing to offer a tentative deal on nuclear energy cooperation .
france , however , was less cautious , vowing to help india with a new nuclear trade pact . the meeting between india 's prime minister manmohan singh and european union leaders in the french port of marseille ended monday , sept .
29 , with an agreement to explore " the possibility of eu-india cooperation in civil nuclear research and development , " however , differences remained over the limits which should be placed on such cooperation .
a draft prepared by the eu called for cooperation " in a manner consistent with the international non-proliferation regime . "
but india , which has not signed the un 's non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and is wary of signing any declaration which appears to commit to it , insisted that the more general phrase " consistent with their respective international commitments " be used .
france , india to do more nuclear business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singh found himself at odds with the eu over climate change sarkozy also concluded some domestic business on the sidelines of the eu-india summit when he and singh vowed to boost nuclear energy cooperation .
" france , which has great trust in india and its prime minister , has worked hard so that india can have access to civilian nuclear energy , " said sarkozy .
he made the comment at a press conference with singh , who arrived in france from the us , where he took india a major step closer to rejoining global nuclear commerce after 30 years in the cold .
singh was to meet with french political leaders and nuclear energy executives in paris tuesday and was expected to sign a major nuclear trade pact .
french energy firm areva said monday it hopes to profit from the nuclear pact by supplying the asian giant with two of the latest design of reactors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.09.2008 osce observers say belarus election " fell short of democracy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce said voters cast their ballots in strictly controlled environments in belarus not a single member of the opposition won a seat in belarus ' parliamentary elections , which was slammed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as " undemocratic . " among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .

the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .

" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .

a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .
monday 's final reading was the lowest in more than two years on the frankfurt exchange .
on monday , london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares sank 2.63 percent to 4,954.11 points in early morning trade , accelerating opening losses .
in paris , the cac 40 slid 2.82 percent to 4,046.17 points .
stock markets across the nordic region too plummeted monday .
the oslo stock exchange fell 8.30 percent by the closing to 301.84 points , its lowest level in nearly three years .
the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "
sarkozy urges support for banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called emergency meetings to curtail the crisis french president nicolas sarkozy attempted monday to rally support for assisting ailing european banks ahead of a meeting at the elysee presidential palace to review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses in france .
" we must not give way in the face of destabilization , we must help our banks , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating european presidency .
appearing with the french president , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said " initiatives " were in preparation for a " structural european response " to the crisis to be unveiled at a european summit in mid-october .

" slovenia 's government has expressed concern over what is seen as its neighbor 's embrace of far-right parties .
" the result of elections in austria is surprising and worthy of concern to some extent , particularly in those cases that represent a rejection of european values , " slovenia 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
the vote was a major win for austria 's two far-right parties which campaigned on an anti-immigration platform .
both the freedom party and alliance for the future of austria have promised to defend the rights of " true austrians . "
disappointed with politics the british press also expressed its dismay over the turn of events .
the populist daily mail described the far-right gains as " deeply disturbing , " saying it offered an " unsettling reminder of austria 's nazi past . "
but the daily mail as well as right-leaning daily telegraph viewed the results as an example of a broken political system , not a return to fascism .
" voters like a choice between sensible parties , " the daily telegraph wrote .
" when they do n't get it , they will vote for silly ones . "
main parties to form coalition the social democrats and the conservative people 's party saw their support eroded , although they would still have enough votes to form a coalition .
yet it was the main parties ' failed left-right coalition that doomed the current government .

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .

but will the strong words have any effect ? in an unusually strong statement , the european union has called american lawmakers to order for failing to reach agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to shore up foundering financial institutions and markets .
" the us must take its responsibility in this situation , must show statesmanship for the sake of their own companies and for the sake of the world , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said us lawmakers had " taken leave of their senses " in their failure to pass the rescue measure .
" i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington , " mandelson said in an interview with the bbc .
german chancellor angela merkel urged the us to support the measure , saying its quick passage " is the precondition for creating new confidence on the markets " and " of incredibly great significance . "

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .
" it is important that not only medvedev and merkel speak of these problems but also experts from all these sectors and non-governmental organizations .

30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .

moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .

as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .

the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.09.2008 osce observers say belarus election " fell short of democracy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce said voters cast their ballots in strictly controlled environments in belarus not a single member of the opposition won a seat in belarus ' parliamentary elections , which was slammed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as " undemocratic . " among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .

" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .

" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .

the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .

on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .

concern has been growing among german exporters at the clouding of the global economy .
but the recent turmoil on financial markets has not translated into any significant layoffs in germany . " unemployment is falling and the number of jobs is continuing to rise , " federal labor office chief frank-juergen weise said .
demand for staff remained fairly high . the politically more important unadjusted tally was 3.081 million , down 115,000 from august as hiring increased after germany 's summer vacations . that brought the unadjusted joblessness rate down 0.2 of a percentage point to 7.4 per cent . german labor minister olaf scholz hailed the unadjusted tally as germany 's best since 1992 , attributing it to job-creation policy .
he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .
the september seasonally-unadjusted tally was 463,000 less than in the same month last year . however a spokesman for one of the opposition parties in berlin , rainer bruederle of the free democrat party , dismissed the brighter joblessness figure as " just a lull before the storm .

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .

the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .
" it is important that not only medvedev and merkel speak of these problems but also experts from all these sectors and non-governmental organizations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.09.2008 eu castigates us congress over bailout failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe says us lawmakers have to face up to the crisis as the us financial crisis continues to unsettle global financial markets , brussels has said american legislators need to start meeting their obligations .
but will the strong words have any effect ? in an unusually strong statement , the european union has called american lawmakers to order for failing to reach agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to shore up foundering financial institutions and markets .
" the us must take its responsibility in this situation , must show statesmanship for the sake of their own companies and for the sake of the world , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said us lawmakers had " taken leave of their senses " in their failure to pass the rescue measure .
" i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington , " mandelson said in an interview with the bbc .
german chancellor angela merkel urged the us to support the measure , saying its quick passage " is the precondition for creating new confidence on the markets " and " of incredibly great significance . "
the statements came after the us house of representatives narrowly rejected the bailout plan on monday , september 29 .
bildunterschrift : the bailout failure was dramatic - and potentially devastating much of the world , as well as the bush administration , had assumed that representatives would pass the package .
but many members of the house from both parties , fearful of repercussions from voters in november 's national elections , refused to support it .
europe as an example ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laitenberger said washington needs to get its act together laitenberger drew a contrast between the lack of a us response and moves taken by european authorities .
" the system is coping , and therefore we can also have confidence that it comes up with the right answer , " laitenberger said .
on tuesday , the governments of france , belgium and luxemburg announced a 6.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- financial injection to support dexia , a retail bank with some 5.5 million customers .
as part of the deal , two bosses of that institution stepped down from their posts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dexia became the latest european victim of the financial crisis " all the necessary measures will be taken to preserve the interests of dexia 's depositors , " belgian prime minister yves leterme said .
" our ambition was to have very strong political involvement in order to send a signal to the markets . "
the dexia bailout came just hours after the netherlands , belgium and luxemburg agreed to partially nationalize banking giant fortis , supplying some 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- .
on monday , the german government too provided the country 's second largest commercial property lender , hypo real estate holding , a line of credit of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also been busy urging top banks to keep credit lines open to the french economy .
markets on a knife edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets all over the globe are jittery the dexia bailout became necessary after the bank 's stock plummeted nearly 30 percent on monday , reaching an all-time low .
and tuesday was another roller-coaster ride for european stock market brokers .
all the major european indexes opened with dramatic losses , as investors expressed their disappointment at the us failure to agree upon the bailout plan .
but markets rebounded during the course of the day amidst hope that us lawmakers would ultimately be forced to intervene to stop the crisis .
the exchanges in london and paris were up just under two points , while the dax in germany posted a modest gain of 0.4 percent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ecb offers further billions in effort to keep credit flowing the european central bank auctioned off $ 50 billion in one-day loans on tuesday to combat the credit crunch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.09.2008 ecb offers further billions in effort to keep credit flowing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say short jabs are good but wo n't cure the disease the european central bank auctioned off $ 50 billion in one-day loans on tuesday to combat the credit crunch .
but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "
but national governments still face the possibility , however remote , that bailout measures could be found to violate eu guidelines . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .

a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .
" we must always take sides , " he told his audience .

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .
" we must always take sides , " he told his audience .

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .

the oslo stock exchange fell 8.30 percent by the closing to 301.84 points , its lowest level in nearly three years .
the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .

" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .

" among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .

28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .

" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.09.2008 german-russian dialogue forum meets under caucasus cloud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel plans only a flying visit to st. petersburg for talks with president medvedev delegations from germany and russia meet in st. petersburg this week for the traditional gathering of minds from the the political and civil spheres of both nations .
however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .
" it is important that not only medvedev and merkel speak of these problems but also experts from all these sectors and non-governmental organizations .

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .

ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.09.2008 ecb offers further billions in effort to keep credit flowing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say short jabs are good but wo n't cure the disease the european central bank auctioned off $ 50 billion in one-day loans on tuesday to combat the credit crunch .
but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "

" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "

but the recent turmoil on financial markets has not translated into any significant layoffs in germany . " unemployment is falling and the number of jobs is continuing to rise , " federal labor office chief frank-juergen weise said .
demand for staff remained fairly high . the politically more important unadjusted tally was 3.081 million , down 115,000 from august as hiring increased after germany 's summer vacations . that brought the unadjusted joblessness rate down 0.2 of a percentage point to 7.4 per cent . german labor minister olaf scholz hailed the unadjusted tally as germany 's best since 1992 , attributing it to job-creation policy .
he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .

“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .

demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .

" among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .

" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .
monday 's final reading was the lowest in more than two years on the frankfurt exchange .
on monday , london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares sank 2.63 percent to 4,954.11 points in early morning trade , accelerating opening losses .
in paris , the cac 40 slid 2.82 percent to 4,046.17 points .
stock markets across the nordic region too plummeted monday .
the oslo stock exchange fell 8.30 percent by the closing to 301.84 points , its lowest level in nearly three years .
the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

" we must not give way in the face of destabilization , we must help our banks , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating european presidency .
appearing with the french president , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said " initiatives " were in preparation for a " structural european response " to the crisis to be unveiled at a european summit in mid-october .

" slovenia 's government has expressed concern over what is seen as its neighbor 's embrace of far-right parties .
" the result of elections in austria is surprising and worthy of concern to some extent , particularly in those cases that represent a rejection of european values , " slovenia 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
the vote was a major win for austria 's two far-right parties which campaigned on an anti-immigration platform .
both the freedom party and alliance for the future of austria have promised to defend the rights of " true austrians . "
disappointed with politics the british press also expressed its dismay over the turn of events .
the populist daily mail described the far-right gains as " deeply disturbing , " saying it offered an " unsettling reminder of austria 's nazi past . "
but the daily mail as well as right-leaning daily telegraph viewed the results as an example of a broken political system , not a return to fascism .
" voters like a choice between sensible parties , " the daily telegraph wrote .
" when they do n't get it , they will vote for silly ones . "
main parties to form coalition the social democrats and the conservative people 's party saw their support eroded , although they would still have enough votes to form a coalition .
yet it was the main parties ' failed left-right coalition that doomed the current government .
the social democrats remain the strongest party despite heavy losses .
party head werner faymann said he would seek to form a coalition with the people 's party even though differences between the two centrist parties had triggered early elections .
joerg haider , the leader of the right-wing alliance for the future of austria , has said he would be prepared to join a new government with the conservatives . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .

a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .

concern has been growing among german exporters at the clouding of the global economy .
but the recent turmoil on financial markets has not translated into any significant layoffs in germany . " unemployment is falling and the number of jobs is continuing to rise , " federal labor office chief frank-juergen weise said .
demand for staff remained fairly high . the politically more important unadjusted tally was 3.081 million , down 115,000 from august as hiring increased after germany 's summer vacations . that brought the unadjusted joblessness rate down 0.2 of a percentage point to 7.4 per cent . german labor minister olaf scholz hailed the unadjusted tally as germany 's best since 1992 , attributing it to job-creation policy .
he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .
the september seasonally-unadjusted tally was 463,000 less than in the same month last year . however a spokesman for one of the opposition parties in berlin , rainer bruederle of the free democrat party , dismissed the brighter joblessness figure as " just a lull before the storm .

the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .

in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .

the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.09.2008 osce observers say belarus election " fell short of democracy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce said voters cast their ballots in strictly controlled environments in belarus not a single member of the opposition won a seat in belarus ' parliamentary elections , which was slammed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as " undemocratic . " among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .

the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .

28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .

"
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .

the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .

a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .

" slovenia 's government has expressed concern over what is seen as its neighbor 's embrace of far-right parties .
" the result of elections in austria is surprising and worthy of concern to some extent , particularly in those cases that represent a rejection of european values , " slovenia 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
the vote was a major win for austria 's two far-right parties which campaigned on an anti-immigration platform .
both the freedom party and alliance for the future of austria have promised to defend the rights of " true austrians . "
disappointed with politics the british press also expressed its dismay over the turn of events .
the populist daily mail described the far-right gains as " deeply disturbing , " saying it offered an " unsettling reminder of austria 's nazi past . "
but the daily mail as well as right-leaning daily telegraph viewed the results as an example of a broken political system , not a return to fascism .
" voters like a choice between sensible parties , " the daily telegraph wrote .
" when they do n't get it , they will vote for silly ones . "
main parties to form coalition the social democrats and the conservative people 's party saw their support eroded , although they would still have enough votes to form a coalition .
yet it was the main parties ' failed left-right coalition that doomed the current government .
the social democrats remain the strongest party despite heavy losses .
party head werner faymann said he would seek to form a coalition with the people 's party even though differences between the two centrist parties had triggered early elections .
joerg haider , the leader of the right-wing alliance for the future of austria , has said he would be prepared to join a new government with the conservatives . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .

" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .

in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .

eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 30.09.2008 germany hopes world cup 2011 boosts women 's club soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can chancellor merkel 's support change the flagging fortunes of women 's club soccer ?
the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concern has been growing among german exporters at the clouding of the global economy .
but the recent turmoil on financial markets has not translated into any significant layoffs in germany . " unemployment is falling and the number of jobs is continuing to rise , " federal labor office chief frank-juergen weise said .
demand for staff remained fairly high . the politically more important unadjusted tally was 3.081 million , down 115,000 from august as hiring increased after germany 's summer vacations . that brought the unadjusted joblessness rate down 0.2 of a percentage point to 7.4 per cent . german labor minister olaf scholz hailed the unadjusted tally as germany 's best since 1992 , attributing it to job-creation policy .
he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .
the september seasonally-unadjusted tally was 463,000 less than in the same month last year . however a spokesman for one of the opposition parties in berlin , rainer bruederle of the free democrat party , dismissed the brighter joblessness figure as " just a lull before the storm .

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .

but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .

on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .
always a showman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel , who survived both auschwitz and buchenwald , is pictured seventh from left in the middle bunk his most important literary work is " night , " published in 1958 .
wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .
family killed by nazis born sept .
30 , 1928 , to a jewish shopkeeper who ran his own grocery store and a farmer 's daughter in sighet -lrb- now sighetu marmatiei -rrb- , romania , wiesel was supposed to become a rabbi .
but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .
" he was beaten , and i could n't help him , " wiesel said .
" in his last hour he called my name .
in the end i no longer answered him .
i was afraid . "
wiesel initially reluctant to write the guilt feelings of holocaust survivors , the doubt in the existence of god in the midst of such horror and the questions of jewish identity remained definitively in wiesel 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesel has continued his writing and teaching after the war , he was placed in a french orphanage where he continued his talmudic studies and later studied philosophy and literature at the sorbonne in paris .
for years he worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent , refusing to write about or discuss his experiences in the holocaust .
this changed when he met francois mauriac , winner of the 1952 nobel prize for literature , who encouraged him to remember the " unutterable . "
wiesel published nearly 50 more books and essays , novels and plays , after writing " night . "
a us citizen since 1963 , he became an advocate for persecuted minorities worldwide and won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence , repression and racism .
" i have never believed in collective guilt , " wiesel said last year at auschwitz .
" the children of the killers are not killers .
they are children . "
wiesel is a professor of humanities at boston university .
he continues writing - mostly in french - with unabated vim .
his wife , marion , is the top translator of his work into english .
a few days prior to his 80th birthday , he took part as a peace ambassador in a youth parliament of the united nations in new york where he once worked for nearly 10 years as a correspondent .
he received a long , enthusiastic ovation for is rousing appearance .
" we must always take sides , " he told his audience .

the decision is expected to strain relations within germany 's first coalition government combining christian democrats and greens , two parties who are normally bitter foes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's first coalition government of the greens and the conservative christian democrats anja hajduk , the city-state 's environment minister and a green party member herself , said she had granted the clearance because she had no legal power to stop vattenfall , but would sharply limit its rights to use cooling water . she said that rider would mean the plant 's two generators would have to operate at less than full steam for 250 days per year .
the 2-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- project is set for completion in 2012 . vattenfall says the modern plant will release 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of output , 200 grams less than older coal-fired plants .
supporters said the site would lessen german dependence on russian gas . the electricity company , which also operates nuclear plants in germany , said it would lift the energy yield from coal to 46.5 per cent at moorburg by using waste warmth to heat homes and factories in the city . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , wiesel has dedicated his life to making sure the holocaust is never forgotten . the us writer and nobel peace prize winner , who turns 80 on tuesday , sept .
30 , has campaigned worldwide to keep alive the memory of the holocaust 's 6 million dead - not as a look backward into history , rather as a lesson for the future .
" those who deign to let their memory of the victims dim , kill them a second time , " wiesel said in a memorable speech delivered to the german parliament in 2000 .

wiesel , who considers the book a memoir , gives an incisive and extremely haunting account of his experiences in auschwitz .
the book was translated into 30 languages and is still one of the most-read books about the holocaust .
after the book was published , wiesel rose to cult figure status , particularly in the us where he is regarded as one of the foremost leaders of american judaism .
in 2006 , tv talk show star oprah winfrey selected a new edition of " night " as recommended reading for her book club , catapulting sales of the book to new heights .
she also accompanied wiesel on a trip to auschwitz and invited him to be a guest on her show .
despite the awards and recognition , critics accuse him of largely marketing himself .
" night " is sometimes labeled a novel or autobiographical account .

but his sheltered religious education in the small carpathian mountains was interrupted when the family was deported in 1944 to auschwitz .
" the name meant nothing to us , " wiesel said later in an interview .
" within a few minutes , all the families were torn apart .
males and females were separated . "
wiesel never saw his mother again .
his left arm was tattooed with the prisoner number a-7713 and together with his father he initially was in auschwitz 's main camp .
they were later sent to buchenwald , where his beloved father died shortly before the camp was liberated .

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .
monday 's final reading was the lowest in more than two years on the frankfurt exchange .
on monday , london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares sank 2.63 percent to 4,954.11 points in early morning trade , accelerating opening losses .
in paris , the cac 40 slid 2.82 percent to 4,046.17 points .
stock markets across the nordic region too plummeted monday .
the oslo stock exchange fell 8.30 percent by the closing to 301.84 points , its lowest level in nearly three years .
the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "
sarkozy urges support for banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called emergency meetings to curtail the crisis french president nicolas sarkozy attempted monday to rally support for assisting ailing european banks ahead of a meeting at the elysee presidential palace to review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses in france .
" we must not give way in the face of destabilization , we must help our banks , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating european presidency .
appearing with the french president , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said " initiatives " were in preparation for a " structural european response " to the crisis to be unveiled at a european summit in mid-october .

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.09.2008 osce observers say belarus election " fell short of democracy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce said voters cast their ballots in strictly controlled environments in belarus not a single member of the opposition won a seat in belarus ' parliamentary elections , which was slammed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as " undemocratic . " among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .

" among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .

30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .

as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .

the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .

in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .

the decision is expected to strain relations within germany 's first coalition government combining christian democrats and greens , two parties who are normally bitter foes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's first coalition government of the greens and the conservative christian democrats anja hajduk , the city-state 's environment minister and a green party member herself , said she had granted the clearance because she had no legal power to stop vattenfall , but would sharply limit its rights to use cooling water . she said that rider would mean the plant 's two generators would have to operate at less than full steam for 250 days per year .
the 2-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- project is set for completion in 2012 . vattenfall says the modern plant will release 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of output , 200 grams less than older coal-fired plants .
supporters said the site would lessen german dependence on russian gas . the electricity company , which also operates nuclear plants in germany , said it would lift the energy yield from coal to 46.5 per cent at moorburg by using waste warmth to heat homes and factories in the city . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.09.2008 ecb offers further billions in effort to keep credit flowing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say short jabs are good but wo n't cure the disease the european central bank auctioned off $ 50 billion in one-day loans on tuesday to combat the credit crunch .
but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "
but national governments still face the possibility , however remote , that bailout measures could be found to violate eu guidelines . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "
but national governments still face the possibility , however remote , that bailout measures could be found to violate eu guidelines . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .
the september seasonally-unadjusted tally was 463,000 less than in the same month last year . however a spokesman for one of the opposition parties in berlin , rainer bruederle of the free democrat party , dismissed the brighter joblessness figure as " just a lull before the storm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 30.09.2008 germany hopes world cup 2011 boosts women 's club soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can chancellor merkel 's support change the flagging fortunes of women 's club soccer ?
the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is expected to strain relations within germany 's first coalition government combining christian democrats and greens , two parties who are normally bitter foes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's first coalition government of the greens and the conservative christian democrats anja hajduk , the city-state 's environment minister and a green party member herself , said she had granted the clearance because she had no legal power to stop vattenfall , but would sharply limit its rights to use cooling water . she said that rider would mean the plant 's two generators would have to operate at less than full steam for 250 days per year .
the 2-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- project is set for completion in 2012 . vattenfall says the modern plant will release 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of output , 200 grams less than older coal-fired plants .
supporters said the site would lessen german dependence on russian gas . the electricity company , which also operates nuclear plants in germany , said it would lift the energy yield from coal to 46.5 per cent at moorburg by using waste warmth to heat homes and factories in the city . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .

but will the strong words have any effect ? in an unusually strong statement , the european union has called american lawmakers to order for failing to reach agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to shore up foundering financial institutions and markets .
" the us must take its responsibility in this situation , must show statesmanship for the sake of their own companies and for the sake of the world , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said us lawmakers had " taken leave of their senses " in their failure to pass the rescue measure .
" i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington , " mandelson said in an interview with the bbc .
german chancellor angela merkel urged the us to support the measure , saying its quick passage " is the precondition for creating new confidence on the markets " and " of incredibly great significance . "
the statements came after the us house of representatives narrowly rejected the bailout plan on monday , september 29 .
bildunterschrift : the bailout failure was dramatic - and potentially devastating much of the world , as well as the bush administration , had assumed that representatives would pass the package .

the dexia bailout came just hours after the netherlands , belgium and luxemburg agreed to partially nationalize banking giant fortis , supplying some 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- .

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .

a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , sarkozy had vowed that the french state would come to the aid of any financial institution at risk of failing , to ensure that depositors did not lose any of their savings .
late monday , the governments of france , belgium and luxembourg agreed in principle to inject 6.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- into the struggling franco-belgian financial services group dexia .
economy minister christine lagarde was also due to be questioned by the french parliament on tuesday on the fallout from the global financial crisis and france 's part in the dexia rescue operation .
lagarde will hold a closed-door session with the national assembly finance committee on the multi-billion-euro dexia rescue before heading to the senate for debate focused on the " current economic situation and its consequences for the french and european finance systems , " the house finance committee said in a statement .
sarkozy promises no losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis was another of several financial institutions to be rescued this week lagarde took part in pre-dawn crisis talks with president nicolas sarkozy , as european governments scrambled to shore up fragile banks against the shockwave from the us financial meltdown .
they headed later into talks with france 's top bankers to identify possible weak links in the sector following the decision to save dexia .
the french president warned in a speech last week that that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis but promised that no french depositor would lose so much as a euro in savings , and said that the state would rescue failing institutions .
but sarkozy was battling to stop the fallout from the global financial crisis wreaking havoc on the french banking sector monday .
france will host a meeting of european officials to prepare a summit " in the coming weeks to establish the basis of a new international financial system , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the presidency of the european union .
european finance summit ahead officials from britain , france , germany and italy - the eu members of the g8 - will meet in paris in the coming days to lay the groundwork , he said on the sidelines of an eu-india summit in the southern city of marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's is not the only stock market to suffer " the french banking system is better protected than the others , but the situation has changed , " a senior official in sarkozy 's office said .
" banks are in trouble in germany , belgium and great britain .
we feel a bit surrounded . "
a further sign of economic trouble came with the release monday of jobless figures showing that 41,300 people joined the ranks of france 's unemployed in august , the biggest monthly spike since 1993 , bringing the figure to 1,949,600 .
the government convened a crisis meeting of job sector officials late monday to discuss the figures , which have compounded worries about the financial storm .
critics accused the government of deceit , saying that for months it had touted progress in economic reforms when the jobless situation was less than rosy even before the financial storm struck .
the right-wing president won election in may 2007 on a promise to rev up the economy and bring unemployment - long the nation 's number one concern - down to five percent .
french advisor warns of " quasi-recession " the government unveiled a draft budget on friday that scrapped a pledge to stamp out the deficit by 2012 and as paris struggled to rein in public spending amid sluggish growth .
" we are in a quasi-recession , " said presidential adviser henri guaino .
france is headed into a " difficult period " and the government will " do everything that is necessary " to prevent the economy from taking a nosedive , guaino added .
economy minister lagarde said she nevertheless expected 2009 to end with a jobless rate of 7.1 percent , down from 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
that figure was the lowest rate in 25 years , capping a steady decline in the unemployment rate that had even allowed the problem to slide off the national radar over the past year .
opinion polls show purchasing power has replaced unemployment as the number one concern of the average french voter .
lagarde also unveiled monday a plan to help french households from falling into a credit trap after the bank of france said 88,000 people had filed for personal bankruptcy over the past four years , an increase of 70 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concern has been growing among german exporters at the clouding of the global economy .
but the recent turmoil on financial markets has not translated into any significant layoffs in germany . " unemployment is falling and the number of jobs is continuing to rise , " federal labor office chief frank-juergen weise said .
demand for staff remained fairly high . the politically more important unadjusted tally was 3.081 million , down 115,000 from august as hiring increased after germany 's summer vacations . that brought the unadjusted joblessness rate down 0.2 of a percentage point to 7.4 per cent . german labor minister olaf scholz hailed the unadjusted tally as germany 's best since 1992 , attributing it to job-creation policy .
he said it was encouraging that long-term cases of unemployment were well down . a year ago the comparable unadjusted rate had been 8.5 per cent .
the september seasonally-unadjusted tally was 463,000 less than in the same month last year . however a spokesman for one of the opposition parties in berlin , rainer bruederle of the free democrat party , dismissed the brighter joblessness figure as " just a lull before the storm .

however , this year , things are different . the next round of russian-german intergovernmental consultations known as the st. petersburg dialogue begins on tuesday , sept .
30 with chancellor angela merkel and the german delegation traveling to the russian city to meet with president dmitry medvedev and members of his government .
the dialogue , which was first launched six years ago by predecessors vladimir putin and gerhard schroeder , is an open discussion forum intended to lend new impetus to german-russian relations in a wide range of sectors , from economics and politics to education and science , cultural relations and religion .
it is supported by political and private-sector foundations and private businesses in germany and in russia , as well as the two governments .
a cross-section of experts from all fields are represented at the event .
when the two countries met in june of this year to discuss the 2008 dialogue , president medvedev was newly installed in the kremlin and an atmosphere of optimism reigned over the gathering .
medvedev was keen to put cold war animosity behind russia and germany responded by saying that russia was no longer a threat .
the two sides talked of a modernization of the partnership between them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brief caucasus war will be the elephant in the room but now , four months on , everything is different .
moscow 's behavior during the caucasus conflict in south ossetia and georgia in august has russia 's neighbors and the west in general concerned .
the short war prompted the european union to put its negotiations with russia over a new cooperation and partnership agreement on ice .
after the warmth in june , relations quickly turned chilly .
as a result , merkel will be making only a short stay in st. petersburg .
nevertheless , the caucasus conflict is likely to dominate the proceedings - despite not being on the official agenda .
an unavoidable topic " we can not avoid the topic of the conflict between georgia and russia , and we do n't want to , " said lothar de maiziere , chairman of the st. petersburg dialogue forum .
" we know from the times of the cold war that if one is silent , then nothing is discussed , and then things become even more dangerous . "
the discussions , according to dmitrij suslow from the council for foreign and defense policy , a russian think-tank , will in fact concentrate on the topic , especially the relationship between russia and the eu , specifically germany .
the assigned agenda - that of partnerships in the time of globalization - wo n't come up short , however , he added .
" on the contrary , " said suslow , " recent developments show that both russia and europe are interested in a partnership .
russia is interested in dialogue due to the worsened relations with the us .
cooperation with europe - and particularly with germany - can protect the country against international isolation .
the european union is interested because dialogue under these difficult conditions represents a chance for it to enhance its independent , political power . "
not just for politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil dialogue can help when politicians remain tight-lipped while the united states is now keeping russia at arms length , the eu - through the mediation of germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and french president nicolas sarkozy - has now stepped up as a political player in its own right which can also settle international disputes in difficult times .
in such times , according to suslow , civilian dialogue is even more necessary given that government contacts can become strained .
" the civilian dialogue - between entrepreneurs , scientists , journalists , human rights activists - makes it possible for both sides to come closer together from their different positions , because these difficulties are talked about in detail on several levels , " said suslow .
" without this non-political dialogue russia can not be understood in europe . "
the times in which governments decide on foreign policy alone are in the past , according to alexander rahr , a member of the german team at the forum .
experts from the spheres of economics , education and from non-governmental organizations have increasing influence on the policies of their countries , both in the west and in russia .
" the dialogue must be continued because the implementation of these german-russian consultations into a larger framework , a school of civilian-social dialogue , can really help other countries with their relations with russia , " rahr says .
" it is important that not only medvedev and merkel speak of these problems but also experts from all these sectors and non-governmental organizations .

" among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .
29 , as " bad " or " very-bad " was belarusian ballot counting often taking place behind closed doors barred to independent observers , making free and fair election practically impossible .
" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is expected to strain relations within germany 's first coalition government combining christian democrats and greens , two parties who are normally bitter foes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's first coalition government of the greens and the conservative christian democrats anja hajduk , the city-state 's environment minister and a green party member herself , said she had granted the clearance because she had no legal power to stop vattenfall , but would sharply limit its rights to use cooling water . she said that rider would mean the plant 's two generators would have to operate at less than full steam for 250 days per year .
the 2-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- project is set for completion in 2012 . vattenfall says the modern plant will release 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of output , 200 grams less than older coal-fired plants .
supporters said the site would lessen german dependence on russian gas . the electricity company , which also operates nuclear plants in germany , said it would lift the energy yield from coal to 46.5 per cent at moorburg by using waste warmth to heat homes and factories in the city . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france , however , was less cautious , vowing to help india with a new nuclear trade pact . the meeting between india 's prime minister manmohan singh and european union leaders in the french port of marseille ended monday , sept .
29 , with an agreement to explore " the possibility of eu-india cooperation in civil nuclear research and development , " however , differences remained over the limits which should be placed on such cooperation .
a draft prepared by the eu called for cooperation " in a manner consistent with the international non-proliferation regime . "
but india , which has not signed the un 's non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and is wary of signing any declaration which appears to commit to it , insisted that the more general phrase " consistent with their respective international commitments " be used .
france , india to do more nuclear business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singh found himself at odds with the eu over climate change sarkozy also concluded some domestic business on the sidelines of the eu-india summit when he and singh vowed to boost nuclear energy cooperation .
" france , which has great trust in india and its prime minister , has worked hard so that india can have access to civilian nuclear energy , " said sarkozy .
he made the comment at a press conference with singh , who arrived in france from the us , where he took india a major step closer to rejoining global nuclear commerce after 30 years in the cold .
singh was to meet with french political leaders and nuclear energy executives in paris tuesday and was expected to sign a major nuclear trade pact .
french energy firm areva said monday it hopes to profit from the nuclear pact by supplying the asian giant with two of the latest design of reactors .
a spokeswoman said areva planned to ship two third-generation european pressurized reactors and a supply of nuclear fuel to india , which could lead to a bigger contract to supply a series of power plants .
on saturday , the head of the indian chamber of commerce said his country 's nuclear market could be worth up 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- to areva and other french firms such as alstom over the next 15 years .
ban lifted to allow booming india access to energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad is less of a pariah in india 's eyes india was banned from nuclear trade 30 years ago after its first nuclear test and refusal to sign the non-proliferation treaty , but the vienna-based nuclear suppliers group lifted the ban this month after lobbying by washington .
the us house of representatives passed a major atomic energy pact , which , if it gets senate approval , will allow india to buy nuclear power plants , fuel and technology , provided it allows un inspections of some of its facilities .
new delhi , which is critically short of energy to fuel its booming economy , is looking at investments worth billions of dollars in its power sector .
the world 's second producer of nuclear energy after the united states , france is vying to lead a worldwide revival of the industry , fuelled by worries about global warming and rising energy prices .
since sarkozy 's election last year , france has signed nuclear power deals with half a dozen developing nations in the middle east and north africa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" slovenia 's government has expressed concern over what is seen as its neighbor 's embrace of far-right parties .
" the result of elections in austria is surprising and worthy of concern to some extent , particularly in those cases that represent a rejection of european values , " slovenia 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
the vote was a major win for austria 's two far-right parties which campaigned on an anti-immigration platform .
both the freedom party and alliance for the future of austria have promised to defend the rights of " true austrians . "
disappointed with politics the british press also expressed its dismay over the turn of events .
the populist daily mail described the far-right gains as " deeply disturbing , " saying it offered an " unsettling reminder of austria 's nazi past . "
but the daily mail as well as right-leaning daily telegraph viewed the results as an example of a broken political system , not a return to fascism .
" voters like a choice between sensible parties , " the daily telegraph wrote .
" when they do n't get it , they will vote for silly ones . "
main parties to form coalition the social democrats and the conservative people 's party saw their support eroded , although they would still have enough votes to form a coalition .
yet it was the main parties ' failed left-right coalition that doomed the current government .
the social democrats remain the strongest party despite heavy losses .
party head werner faymann said he would seek to form a coalition with the people 's party even though differences between the two centrist parties had triggered early elections .
joerg haider , the leader of the right-wing alliance for the future of austria , has said he would be prepared to join a new government with the conservatives . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.09.2008 eu castigates us congress over bailout failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe says us lawmakers have to face up to the crisis as the us financial crisis continues to unsettle global financial markets , brussels has said american legislators need to start meeting their obligations .
but will the strong words have any effect ? in an unusually strong statement , the european union has called american lawmakers to order for failing to reach agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to shore up foundering financial institutions and markets .
" the us must take its responsibility in this situation , must show statesmanship for the sake of their own companies and for the sake of the world , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said us lawmakers had " taken leave of their senses " in their failure to pass the rescue measure .
" i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington , " mandelson said in an interview with the bbc .
german chancellor angela merkel urged the us to support the measure , saying its quick passage " is the precondition for creating new confidence on the markets " and " of incredibly great significance . "
the statements came after the us house of representatives narrowly rejected the bailout plan on monday , september 29 .
bildunterschrift : the bailout failure was dramatic - and potentially devastating much of the world , as well as the bush administration , had assumed that representatives would pass the package .
but many members of the house from both parties , fearful of repercussions from voters in november 's national elections , refused to support it .
europe as an example ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laitenberger said washington needs to get its act together laitenberger drew a contrast between the lack of a us response and moves taken by european authorities .
" the system is coping , and therefore we can also have confidence that it comes up with the right answer , " laitenberger said .
on tuesday , the governments of france , belgium and luxemburg announced a 6.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- financial injection to support dexia , a retail bank with some 5.5 million customers .
as part of the deal , two bosses of that institution stepped down from their posts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dexia became the latest european victim of the financial crisis " all the necessary measures will be taken to preserve the interests of dexia 's depositors , " belgian prime minister yves leterme said .
" our ambition was to have very strong political involvement in order to send a signal to the markets . "
the dexia bailout came just hours after the netherlands , belgium and luxemburg agreed to partially nationalize banking giant fortis , supplying some 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- .
on monday , the german government too provided the country 's second largest commercial property lender , hypo real estate holding , a line of credit of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also been busy urging top banks to keep credit lines open to the french economy .
markets on a knife edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets all over the globe are jittery the dexia bailout became necessary after the bank 's stock plummeted nearly 30 percent on monday , reaching an all-time low .
and tuesday was another roller-coaster ride for european stock market brokers .
all the major european indexes opened with dramatic losses , as investors expressed their disappointment at the us failure to agree upon the bailout plan .
but markets rebounded during the course of the day amidst hope that us lawmakers would ultimately be forced to intervene to stop the crisis .
the exchanges in london and paris were up just under two points , while the dax in germany posted a modest gain of 0.4 percent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" among the problems noted by osce preliminary findings on monday , sept .

" despite some minor improvements , the sept .
28 parliamentary election in belarus ultimately fell short of osce commitments for democratic elections ...
the election took place in a strictly controlled environment with a barely visible campaign , " the osce said in its report .
" voting was generally well conducted but the process deteriorated considerably during the vote count .
promises to ensure transparency of the vote count were not implemented , " the monitors ' report said .
" the count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48 percent of polling stations visited .
where access was possible several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed . "
osce monitors were prevented or hindered from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases , the monitors also noted .
" this compromised the transparency of this fundamental element of the election process , " the report stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters had little access to information on candidates the report quoted senior osce monitor anne-marie lizin as saying that the signal to improve the electoral system was " not implemented and substantial improvements are required if belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election . "
the report did highlight some improvements , however .
" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

" positive developments included the slightly increased access of opposition representatives to election commissions , the decision to rebroadcast once five-minute candidate spots during prime time , and the recommendation to seal ballot box slots overnight during the five-day early voting period , ” the osce reported .
“ some opposition candidates noted progress in their ability to conduct meetings in authorized locations without interference . "
lukaschenko dominates press and airwaves however , the unwillingness by belarus ' state-controlled news media to focus on candidates , while at the same time devoting more than 90 percent of print and air time to authoritarian president aleksander lukashenko and his government , prevented voters from learning much about candidates , the report said .
" the legislative framework continues to present obstacles for elections in line with osce commitments , ” it stated .
“ the media coverage of the campaign did not provide meaningful information for voters to be able to make an informed choice .
political parties played a minor role , and restrictions imposed by the state authorities did not allow for a vibrant campaign with real competition . "
the osce deployed some 450 international observers from 43 countries including more than 320 short-term observers and 58 experts and long term observers fielded by odihr -lrb- office for democratic institutions and human rights -rrb- as well as 66 parliamentarians and staff from the osce parliamentary assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered to proclaim the election as a fraud belarus central election commission head lidia yermoshina said the vote was free and fair , and argued the opposition failed to gain votes because their policies frightened belarusians , the official belapan news agency said .
" the fear of mass demonstrations and the disapproval of radical changes which could have happened if the opposition was elected , led to these results , " yermoshina said .
demonstrators protest " farce " despite bans on rallies several hundred opposition members gathered in the city center of minsk to protest the alleged fraud , holding up road flares and banners decrying the election as a farce .
the demonstration blocked traffic but was otherwise peaceful , with police making no move to interfere .
the protestors had dispersed by early evening .
according to the russian itar-tass news agency , 100 of 110 districts were counted .
turnout was at 75.3 percent to vote for the 263 candidates competing for the 110 seats in the belarus parliament , 70 of them from the opposition .
opposition candidates lagged behind the government 's candidates by a wide margin , the commission said .
among the successful directly-elected candidates were many representatives of large businesses and regional administration .
president 's claim of fairness challenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko promised free and fair elections before the poll ahead of the elections , authoritarian president alexander lukashenko stressed his interest in closer ties with the west , saying the polls would be fair and democratic .
" it will be very difficult for anyone to criticize this election as unfair , " lukashenko said after casting his vote in minsk .
an opposition statement made public monday did just that , saying the pro-lukashenko parliament had been elected " by the means of mass falsification . "
the lukashenko government faked the results by allowing , in many cases , only pro-government officials to count votes , they claimed .
" our position is clear and precise : we do consider this election to be neither fair , nor legitimate , inasmuch as only 5 percent of our representatives were allowed -lrb- by the state -rrb- to participate in regional election commissions and count ballots , " anatoliy lebedko , an opposition organizer , said .
during the last eight years , no opposition member has won a seat in parliament .

but experts say such temporary injections of liquidity wo n't solve the financial crisis . the additional credit comes on top of $ 30 billion the ecb made available on monday , september 29 .
the injections , the bank has said , are necessary to combat global banking jitters which worsened after the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion aid package to buttress us financial markets on monday .
amidst the uncertainty , banks are wary of lending money to one another .
instead , financial institutions chose to deposit some 44.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.5 billion -rrb- with the ecb overnight between monday and tuesday .
the interest banks receive from the ecb is less than the prime rate they could receive from each other , but that is of secondary importance .
" security has become more import than profits , " kornelius purps , an analyst at unicredit , one of europe 's leading financial groups , told reuters news agency .
you gotta have faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is trying to stave off a crisis financial experts have praised the ecb 's active approach .
but they caution that short-term liquidity infusions are not going to fix the global credit crisis .
" the ecb ca n't solve the problem with injections of money , even if they are initially good for banks , " commerzbank senior economist michael schubert told reuters .
the current finance crunch has less to do with money availability than money psychology .
" the financial crisis has become a global crisis of faith , " schubert said .
" trust can only be restored when all the risks and possible losses have been made public . "
there has been speculation that the ecb might also lower interest rates this week .
although there has been no official confirmation that such a plan is in offing , the mere idea of it helped sparked minor rallies on european stock exchanges on tuesday .
state bailouts raise questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants a closer look at the proposed hre deal meanwhile , national governments continue to prop up and in some cases partially nationalize troubled banks .
on tuesday , the french-belgian-luxembourgian institution dexia became the latest in a long line of institutions to receive assistance .
on monday , germany provided 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- to help hypo real estate , or hre , but such bailouts potentially raise thorny legal issues .
some have questioned whether they violate eu rules against state subsidies .
and the eu said that berlin did not consult with brussels in advance about the hre rescue plan , although notification was made later .
" the german authorities have indicated that they will be giving us more details once the package has been finalized by parliamentary procedures , " jonathan todd , spokesman for the european commissioner on competition , told dw-radio .
" at this point it still has to be verified whether that measure taken for hypo peal estate constitutes state aid or not . "
but should n't the rules be relaxed in view of the crisis ?
" there is no suggestion that we should suspend the application of the state aid rules , " todd said .
" the state aid rules have proven a very good framework to ensure a coordinated response to these problems .
they 're part of the solution rather than the problem . "
but national governments still face the possibility , however remote , that bailout measures could be found to violate eu guidelines . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the host cities for the 2011 women ’ s world cup in germany were unveiled tuesday .
though the women ’ s national team is already a success , the german fa hopes the event will bolster the struggling women ’ s club game . germany 's soccer elite , along with chancellor angela merkel and fifa president sepp blatter , gathered on tuesday , sept 30 in berlin to announce the host cities for the 2011 women 's world cup . the nine cities are berlin , frankfurt , moenchengladbach , bochum , dresden , leverkusen , augsburg , sinsheim and wolfsburg . there was criticism from the eastern german city of magdeburg , which along with bielefeld , was one of two cities to see its bid discarded . " i am disappointed , " magdeburg mayor lutz truemper said in a radio interview .
" you can work as hard as you like , but you do n't have any chance of being noticed in the east . " however the german football association dfb defended the choice of venues , saying not only was the eastern part of the country represented by dresden but that the stadium in magdeburg would have needed an investment of three million euros alone for temporary media facilities . " of course it 's hard on two cities , but we had to take account of so many factors .
in any case it is progress on the world cups of past years , " zwanziger said . major upgrade the 2011 women ’ s world cup , with nine venues , will be a much larger logistical undertaking than any mounted before .
the 2007 world cup in china saw five venues , while the 2003 tournament in the united states was played in six cities . a major reason for ramping up the scale of the event was germany ’ s successful hosting of the 2006 men ’ s world cup .
that germans turned out in large numbers for public viewing during euro 2008 in neighboring switzerland and austria also gave the impression that the public ’ s appetite for soccer tournaments is nearly insatiable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's women 's national team has snapped up one title after the other in recent years also playing a role in high hopes for 2011 , is german dominance on the pitch .
since germany fielded its first women ’ s national side in 1982 , the team ’ s record has been one of rousing success : two world cups , six european championships , and three olympic bronze medals . in the current fifa world rankings , germany is number two , behind just the united states . women ’ s soccer at the grassroots level is healthy as well .
the dfb has more than one million female members , of whom nearly 700,000 are regular players . but alongside all these positives is a major weak point : germany ’ s women ’ s club game . women 's club game fails to excite the german national team wins matches , gets decent television ratings , and fills medium-sized stadiums , but the german women ’ s club game fails to inspire the same reaction .
the average women ’ s bundesliga match draws just 885 fans . the fact that the german club game struggles despite one of women ’ s soccer ’ s biggest stars , three-time world footballer of the year birgit prinz , playing in the league -lrb- for champions 1 .
ffc frankfurt -rrb- has some thinking that the public doesn ’ t respond to stars . former german national team player steffi jones believes , however , that the league just needs more of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi jones , left , see here with chancellor merkel , says club soccer needs big names “ women ’ s football hasn ’ t had enough big personalities , ” she said .
“ we need to generate them . ” another idea to pique interest in the club game is to raise the profile of the clubs themselves . the women ’ s bundesliga ’ s traditional top teams include 1 .
ffc frankfurt , fcr duisburg and turbine potsdam .
these are not exactly household names in germany or anywhere else . but also up in the women ’ s league ’ s top tier is fc bayern munich , a perennial power in men ’ s club soccer .
and the women ’ s squads of familiar clubs like hamburger sv and vfl wolfsburg are beginning to put a dent in the top division as well . if these already well-known clubs devoted more of their ample incomes to the women ’ s game , some say , attendance figures might just go up . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington 's rejection of a $ 700-billion bailout caused world markets to plummet . only a few weeks ago , banks in the euro zone financial sector were said to be safe from the us-born financial crisis , but now , as the global financial situation gradually worsens , five european governments have had to step in to prop up financial institutions .
separately , news emerged late monday , sept .
29 , that the us house of representatives rejected a $ 700 billion measure to rescue the failing american financial system .
the bailout bill was defeated after many house republicans ignored their leaders ' pleas and voted against it .
a majority of democrats voted in favor of the plan .
" i feel they 've taken leave of their senses , " said european union trade commissioner peter mandelson of us lawmakers monday in an interview with bbc , " and i hope that in europe we will not see politicians and parliamentarians replicating the sort of irresponsibility and political partisanship that we have seen in washington . "
the stock market reacted negatively to the vote , with world stocks losing about $ 1.7 trillion monday , according to the msci 's global index .
the news of the failure of the biggest us bailout in history came on a day when initial confidence in the sturdiness of the european banking sector took a battering as governments in belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands found themselves forced to offer hastily arranged state support for a handful of banks to avoid their collapse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shares plunged 63 percent when the frankfurt stock exchange opened monday the german government and top banks based in europe 's largest economy had to inject urgently needed funds into mortgage lender hypo real estate , which had been teetering on the brink of disintegration prior to the rescue package .
the total sum of the hre bailout was not disclosed , but the german finance ministry said its credit line to the lender was worth 35 billion euros .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's government took the step of temporarily nationalizing the loans and mortgage business of the country 's eighth-biggest mortgage lender , bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- .
" following recent turbulence in global financial markets , bradford & bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution , " the british treasury said on monday .
lastly , benelux banking and insurance company fortis had to be propped up by an 11.2 billion-euro package funded by the three benelux countries , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg .
european stock markets plummet the emergency rescue packages sent jitters through europe 's bourses .
german shares plunged over four percent after the hypo real estate bailout .
the blue-chip 30-share dax in frankfurt closed at 5807.08 points , down more than 250 points or 4.23 per cent from the pre-weekend closing level .
monday 's final reading was the lowest in more than two years on the frankfurt exchange .
on monday , london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares sank 2.63 percent to 4,954.11 points in early morning trade , accelerating opening losses .
in paris , the cac 40 slid 2.82 percent to 4,046.17 points .
stock markets across the nordic region too plummeted monday .
the oslo stock exchange fell 8.30 percent by the closing to 301.84 points , its lowest level in nearly three years .
the stockholm stock exchange meanwhile plunged 5.73 percent lower to 246.20 points , and the copenhagen stock exchange tumbled 5.30 percent to 358.78 points , with denmark 's largest bank danske bank diving 6.13 percent .
eu officials call for tighter regulation european officials have begun calling for heightened regulation of the european financial system to avoid a repeat of what has already been a costly exercise in trying to keep business as usual .
" stronger international regulation agreed at international level " is needed in order to " re-civilize " financial markets so that such a crisis will not be repeated , german finance minister peter steinbrueck said sunday .
financial analysts examining the european financial sector said a us-style , sector-wide bailout was not the panacea to the current financial crisis .
instead , they too championed better regulation as the answer .
" so , for now , financial supervision in europe remains very fragmented on a country level , " analysts at banking group citi said .
" in turn , this may make the question of which country bears the cost for bailouts controversial , especially given that some banks have assets that are very large compared to the gdp of the host country . "
sarkozy urges support for banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called emergency meetings to curtail the crisis french president nicolas sarkozy attempted monday to rally support for assisting ailing european banks ahead of a meeting at the elysee presidential palace to review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses in france .
" we must not give way in the face of destabilization , we must help our banks , " said sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating european presidency .
appearing with the french president , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said " initiatives " were in preparation for a " structural european response " to the crisis to be unveiled at a european summit in mid-october .
" that 's the only way to ensure that stability and confidence can return , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france , however , was less cautious , vowing to help india with a new nuclear trade pact . the meeting between india 's prime minister manmohan singh and european union leaders in the french port of marseille ended monday , sept .
29 , with an agreement to explore " the possibility of eu-india cooperation in civil nuclear research and development , " however , differences remained over the limits which should be placed on such cooperation .
a draft prepared by the eu called for cooperation " in a manner consistent with the international non-proliferation regime . "
but india , which has not signed the un 's non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and is wary of signing any declaration which appears to commit to it , insisted that the more general phrase " consistent with their respective international commitments " be used .
france , india to do more nuclear business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singh found himself at odds with the eu over climate change sarkozy also concluded some domestic business on the sidelines of the eu-india summit when he and singh vowed to boost nuclear energy cooperation .
" france , which has great trust in india and its prime minister , has worked hard so that india can have access to civilian nuclear energy , " said sarkozy .
he made the comment at a press conference with singh , who arrived in france from the us , where he took india a major step closer to rejoining global nuclear commerce after 30 years in the cold .
singh was to meet with french political leaders and nuclear energy executives in paris tuesday and was expected to sign a major nuclear trade pact .
french energy firm areva said monday it hopes to profit from the nuclear pact by supplying the asian giant with two of the latest design of reactors .
a spokeswoman said areva planned to ship two third-generation european pressurized reactors and a supply of nuclear fuel to india , which could lead to a bigger contract to supply a series of power plants .
on saturday , the head of the indian chamber of commerce said his country 's nuclear market could be worth up 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- to areva and other french firms such as alstom over the next 15 years .
ban lifted to allow booming india access to energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad is less of a pariah in india 's eyes india was banned from nuclear trade 30 years ago after its first nuclear test and refusal to sign the non-proliferation treaty , but the vienna-based nuclear suppliers group lifted the ban this month after lobbying by washington .
the us house of representatives passed a major atomic energy pact , which , if it gets senate approval , will allow india to buy nuclear power plants , fuel and technology , provided it allows un inspections of some of its facilities .
new delhi , which is critically short of energy to fuel its booming economy , is looking at investments worth billions of dollars in its power sector .
the world 's second producer of nuclear energy after the united states , france is vying to lead a worldwide revival of the industry , fuelled by worries about global warming and rising energy prices .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- rich flanders seeks more autonomy bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 04:31 gmt , tuesday , 30 september 2008 05:31 uk rich flanders seeks more autonomy belgian politicians are struggling to end a crisis that has paralysed the government for 15 months .
at the heart of the stalemate are the rival aspirations of dutch and french-speakers .
in the first of a series of articles on divided belgium , henri astier profiles flanders .
speed cameras - hardly popular anywhere - are a source of particular irritation in flanders .
more than 1,000 have been installed across the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , while wallonia , the french-speaking southern half , has only a handful .
yet revenue from fines is collected centrally and redistributed .
many flemish motorists not only resent being caught speeding , but feel they are subsidising freewheeling walloons in the process .
the speed cameras provide a neat snapshot of flemish grievances .
" the hard-working north is supporting the south , just like in italy , " says pascal francois , 42 , an architect from the town of aalst .
flanders indeed has wealth , a hard-working population , and beautiful , world-famous cities - like bruges , ghent and antwerp .
many there are asking why their taxes should prop up what they regard as a lagging , mismanaged region .
" walloons should be responsible for what they do , " says roger vandervoorde , 65 , a retired sales director , sipping a drink in front of ghent 's picture-perfect cathedral .
" the best would be a confederation , with each part responsible for itself and only a few small matters handled federally . "
deadlock such reform is precisely what the belgian government , dominated by flemish conservatives , has in mind .
belgian devolution federal government : foreign affairs , defence , justice , health , welfare language-based communities : education , culture regional governments : economic policy , labour , housing , environment , energy , transport belgium 's federal conundrum but the walloons are digging in their heels .
they regard confederation as secession in all but name , and insist on keeping tax and welfare policies at federal level .
as a result belgium has not had an effective government since the june 2007 elections .
pressure in flanders for more devolution is coming from both ordinary voters and business leaders .
luc de bruyckere , chairman of the ghent-based food group ter beke and vice-president of feb , belgium 's main employers ' federation , says a more regional approach to economic policy is urgently needed .
he points out that flanders has a very tight labour market , while wallonia is suffering from 17 % unemployment .
" we have to organise ourselves in such a way that the different problems can be answered , " mr de bruykere says .
" one size fits all is not a solution . "
remi vermeiren , a former chairman of the banking giant kbc , contends that flemish people " believe more in a market economy " than walloons , and argues for outright independence for flanders .
but resurgent flemish pride is based on much deeper forces than just material wealth .
the cultural divide between europe 's germanic north and latin south has run through the middle of belgium since the roman empire .
" we are a very dual country with two areas that differ in many , many ways , " mr vermeiren says .
language problem the sense of flemish identity is all the more acute as it was suppressed by the french-speaking elites that ran belgium after the 1830 revolution .
the constitution was written in french .
a dutch version , written a century later , was not given equal legal force until 1967 .
as the dutch-speaking majority demanded recognition , it was mainly pressing claims against the belgian state .
from the 1960s - with the south 's old mining and steel industries in terminal decline and the north powering ahead - a series of constitutional reforms gradually devolved more powers to the regions .
but for all its economic dominance and political assertiveness , the flemish still feels culturally on the back foot - and this contributes to their prickliness . "
you do n't have a belgian language or a belgian nation - you only have flemish and walloon people , plus a few germans " johann daelman vlaams belang wallonia may be poorer , but it is part of the 200m-strong francophone community .
the flemish are not standing on the shoulders of a friendly giant next door - and can be irked by walloon cultural self-assurance .
language is a particular sore point .
like their dutch brethren , the flemish are taught from an early age the need to learn foreign languages .
walloons are not .
" if we take part in a meeting with , say , eight dutch-speakers and two french-speakers - we often all end up speaking french so everyone can understand , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , a brussels-based umbrella group for immigrant associations .
suburban fears flemish defensiveness is at its sharpest near brussels .
the capital , which used to have a dutch-speaking majority until the early 20th century , is now overwhelmingly francophone .
its population is spreading outward in search of greenery and cheaper homes - a move that many in the flemish suburbs find threatening .
liederkerke , a traditionally working-class town 15 miles -lrb- 25km -rrb- west of brussels , is one of many suburbs that have seen an influx of both rich expatriates and african immigrants .
" that cocktail is leading to liederkerke being more french and that is growing fast , " says town councillor johan daelman , who worries about the " invasion " faced by the city .
the number of families without a dutch-speaking parent has doubled in the past four years , to reach almost a quarter of the 13,000-strong population .
the town clearly feels the need to remind newcomers where they are .
one sign , featuring a nationalist version of the flemish lion , proclaims : " liedekerke , where the flemish are at home . "
another signs reads : " welcome to our flemish commune . "
from mr daelman , the message is : " you can come , but do n't bring big-city problems and respect local people . "
mr daelman belongs to the right-wing vlaams belang -lrb- flemish interest -rrb- party , which seeks a separate flemish republic .
" belgium will not stay united , " he predicts .
" you do n't have a belgian language or a belgian nation .
you only have flemish and walloon people - plus a few germans . "
allegiance vlaams belang , widely regarded as xenophobic , is shunned by mainstream parties and in opposition everywhere , including the liedekerke municipality .
despite - or perhaps because of - its pariah status , the party has achieved considerable success in recent years by attracting protest votes .
it is the largest single party in the flemish parliament .
however a wide majority in flanders reject flemish separatism .
most people just want more autonomy within the belgian state .
" the problem with parties like vlaams belang is that they make our job a lot more difficult , " says sam custers , director of a flemish cultural centre in kraainem , another suburb of brussels .
" they create a negative image of flanders .
our message is : we 're open to everyone . "
flemish pride rarely takes a virulent form .
french-speakers visiting flanders are not in hostile territory .
the worst risk they might take is not being served until they make a token attempt to speak dutch .

at the heart of the stalemate are the rival aspirations of dutch and french-speakers .
in the first of a series of articles on divided belgium , henri astier profiles flanders .
beautiful antwerp exudes the prosperity and confidence of flanders speed cameras - hardly popular anywhere - are a source of particular irritation in flanders .
more than 1,000 have been installed across the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , while wallonia , the french-speaking southern half , has only a handful .
yet revenue from fines is collected centrally and redistributed .
many flemish motorists not only resent being caught speeding , but feel they are subsidising freewheeling walloons in the process .
the speed cameras provide a neat snapshot of flemish grievances .
" the hard-working north is supporting the south , just like in italy , " says pascal francois , 42 , an architect from the town of aalst .
flanders indeed has wealth , a hard-working population , and beautiful , world-famous cities - like bruges , ghent and antwerp .
many there are asking why their taxes should prop up what they regard as a lagging , mismanaged region .
" walloons should be responsible for what they do , " says roger vandervoorde , 65 , a retired sales director , sipping a drink in front of ghent 's picture-perfect cathedral .
" the best would be a confederation , with each part responsible for itself and only a few small matters handled federally . "
deadlock such reform is precisely what the belgian government , dominated by flemish conservatives , has in mind .
belgian devolution federal government : foreign affairs , defence , justice , health , welfare language-based communities : education , culture regional governments : economic policy , labour , housing , environment , energy , transport belgium 's federal conundrum but the walloons are digging in their heels .
they regard confederation as secession in all but name , and insist on keeping tax and welfare policies at federal level .
as a result belgium has not had an effective government since the june 2007 elections .
pressure in flanders for more devolution is coming from both ordinary voters and business leaders .
luc de bruyckere , chairman of the ghent-based food group ter beke and vice-president of feb , belgium 's main employers ' federation , says a more regional approach to economic policy is urgently needed .
he points out that flanders has a very tight labour market , while wallonia is suffering from 17 % unemployment .
" we have to organise ourselves in such a way that the different problems can be answered , " mr de bruykere says .
" one size fits all is not a solution . "
remi vermeiren , a former chairman of the banking giant kbc , contends that flemish people " believe more in a market economy " than walloons , and argues for outright independence for flanders .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures but resurgent flemish pride is based on much deeper forces than just material wealth .
the cultural divide between europe 's germanic north and latin south has run through the middle of belgium since the roman empire .
" we are a very dual country with two areas that differ in many , many ways , " mr vermeiren says .
language problem the sense of flemish identity is all the more acute as it was suppressed by the french-speaking elites that ran belgium after the 1830 revolution .
the constitution was written in french .
a dutch version , written a century later , was not given equal legal force until 1967 .
as the dutch-speaking majority demanded recognition , it was mainly pressing claims against the belgian state .
from the 1960s - with the south 's old mining and steel industries in terminal decline and the north powering ahead - a series of constitutional reforms gradually devolved more powers to the regions .
but for all its economic dominance and political assertiveness , the flemish still feels culturally on the back foot - and this contributes to their prickliness .
you do n't have a belgian language or a belgian nation - you only have flemish and walloon people , plus a few germans johann daelman vlaams belang wallonia may be poorer , but it is part of the 200m-strong francophone community .
the flemish are not standing on the shoulders of a friendly giant next door - and can be irked by walloon cultural self-assurance .
language is a particular sore point .
like their dutch brethren , the flemish are taught from an early age the need to learn foreign languages .
walloons are not .
" if we take part in a meeting with , say , eight dutch-speakers and two french-speakers - we often all end up speaking french so everyone can understand , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , a brussels-based umbrella group for immigrant associations .
suburban fears flemish defensiveness is at its sharpest near brussels .
the capital , which used to have a dutch-speaking majority until the early 20th century , is now overwhelmingly francophone .
its population is spreading outward in search of greenery and cheaper homes - a move that many in the flemish suburbs find threatening .
liederkerke , a traditionally working-class town 15 miles -lrb- 25km -rrb- west of brussels , is one of many suburbs that have seen an influx of both rich expatriates and african immigrants .
in liederkerke , the flemish are at home , and respectful guests welcome " that cocktail is leading to liederkerke being more french and that is growing fast , " says town councillor johan daelman , who worries about the " invasion " faced by the city .
the number of families without a dutch-speaking parent has doubled in the past four years , to reach almost a quarter of the 13,000-strong population .
the town clearly feels the need to remind newcomers where they are .
one sign , featuring a nationalist version of the flemish lion , proclaims : " liedekerke , where the flemish are at home . "
another signs reads : " welcome to our flemish commune . "
from mr daelman , the message is : " you can come , but do n't bring big-city problems and respect local people . "
mr daelman belongs to the right-wing vlaams belang -lrb- flemish interest -rrb- party , which seeks a separate flemish republic .
" belgium will not stay united , " he predicts .
" you do n't have a belgian language or a belgian nation .
you only have flemish and walloon people - plus a few germans . "
allegiance vlaams belang , widely regarded as xenophobic , is shunned by mainstream parties and in opposition everywhere , including the liedekerke municipality .
despite - or perhaps because of - its pariah status , the party has achieved considerable success in recent years by attracting protest votes .
it is the largest single party in the flemish parliament .
however a wide majority in flanders reject flemish separatism .
most people just want more autonomy within the belgian state .
" the problem with parties like vlaams belang is that they make our job a lot more difficult , " says sam custers , director of a flemish cultural centre in kraainem , another suburb of brussels .
" they create a negative image of flanders .
our message is : we 're open to everyone . "
flemish pride rarely takes a virulent form .
french-speakers visiting flanders are not in hostile territory .
the worst risk they might take is not being served until they make a token attempt to speak dutch .
but even the least nationalist among the flemish know where their main allegiance lies .
" i am flemish first , belgian second , " says pascal francois of aalst .

at the heart of the stalemate are the rival aspirations of dutch and french-speakers .
in the first of a series of articles on divided belgium , henri astier profiles flanders .
beautiful antwerp exudes the prosperity and confidence of flanders speed cameras - hardly popular anywhere - are a source of particular irritation in flanders .
more than 1,000 have been installed across the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , while wallonia , the french-speaking southern half , has only a handful .
yet revenue from fines is collected centrally and redistributed .
many flemish motorists not only resent being caught speeding , but feel they are subsidising freewheeling walloons in the process .
the speed cameras provide a neat snapshot of flemish grievances .
" the hard-working north is supporting the south , just like in italy , " says pascal francois , 42 , an architect from the town of aalst .
flanders indeed has wealth , a hard-working population , and beautiful , world-famous cities - like bruges , ghent and antwerp .
many there are asking why their taxes should prop up what they regard as a lagging , mismanaged region .
" walloons should be responsible for what they do , " says roger vandervoorde , 65 , a retired sales director , sipping a drink in front of ghent 's picture-perfect cathedral .
" the best would be a confederation , with each part responsible for itself and only a few small matters handled federally . "
deadlock such reform is precisely what the belgian government , dominated by flemish conservatives , has in mind .
belgian devolution federal government : foreign affairs , defence , justice , health , welfare language-based communities : education , culture regional governments : economic policy , labour , housing , environment , energy , transport belgium 's federal conundrum but the walloons are digging in their heels .
they regard confederation as secession in all but name , and insist on keeping tax and welfare policies at federal level .
as a result belgium has not had an effective government since the june 2007 elections .
pressure in flanders for more devolution is coming from both ordinary voters and business leaders .
luc de bruyckere , chairman of the ghent-based food group ter beke and vice-president of feb , belgium 's main employers ' federation , says a more regional approach to economic policy is urgently needed .
he points out that flanders has a very tight labour market , while wallonia is suffering from 17 % unemployment .
" we have to organise ourselves in such a way that the different problems can be answered , " mr de bruykere says .
" one size fits all is not a solution . "
remi vermeiren , a former chairman of the banking giant kbc , contends that flemish people " believe more in a market economy " than walloons , and argues for outright independence for flanders .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures but resurgent flemish pride is based on much deeper forces than just material wealth .
the cultural divide between europe 's germanic north and latin south has run through the middle of belgium since the roman empire .
" we are a very dual country with two areas that differ in many , many ways , " mr vermeiren says .
language problem the sense of flemish identity is all the more acute as it was suppressed by the french-speaking elites that ran belgium after the 1830 revolution .
the constitution was written in french .
a dutch version , written a century later , was not given equal legal force until 1967 .
as the dutch-speaking majority demanded recognition , it was mainly pressing claims against the belgian state .
from the 1960s - with the south 's old mining and steel industries in terminal decline and the north powering ahead - a series of constitutional reforms gradually devolved more powers to the regions .
but for all its economic dominance and political assertiveness , the flemish still feels culturally on the back foot - and this contributes to their prickliness .
you do n't have a belgian language or a belgian nation - you only have flemish and walloon people , plus a few germans johann daelman vlaams belang wallonia may be poorer , but it is part of the 200m-strong francophone community .
the flemish are not standing on the shoulders of a friendly giant next door - and can be irked by walloon cultural self-assurance .
language is a particular sore point .
like their dutch brethren , the flemish are taught from an early age the need to learn foreign languages .
walloons are not .
" if we take part in a meeting with , say , eight dutch-speakers and two french-speakers - we often all end up speaking french so everyone can understand , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , a brussels-based umbrella group for immigrant associations .
suburban fears flemish defensiveness is at its sharpest near brussels .
the capital , which used to have a dutch-speaking majority until the early 20th century , is now overwhelmingly francophone .
its population is spreading outward in search of greenery and cheaper homes - a move that many in the flemish suburbs find threatening .
liederkerke , a traditionally working-class town 15 miles -lrb- 25km -rrb- west of brussels , is one of many suburbs that have seen an influx of both rich expatriates and african immigrants .
in liederkerke , the flemish are at home , and respectful guests welcome " that cocktail is leading to liederkerke being more french and that is growing fast , " says town councillor johan daelman , who worries about the " invasion " faced by the city .
the number of families without a dutch-speaking parent has doubled in the past four years , to reach almost a quarter of the 13,000-strong population .
the town clearly feels the need to remind newcomers where they are .
one sign , featuring a nationalist version of the flemish lion , proclaims : " liedekerke , where the flemish are at home . "
another signs reads : " welcome to our flemish commune . "
from mr daelman , the message is : " you can come , but do n't bring big-city problems and respect local people . "
mr daelman belongs to the right-wing vlaams belang -lrb- flemish interest -rrb- party , which seeks a separate flemish republic .
" belgium will not stay united , " he predicts .
" you do n't have a belgian language or a belgian nation .
you only have flemish and walloon people - plus a few germans . "
allegiance vlaams belang , widely regarded as xenophobic , is shunned by mainstream parties and in opposition everywhere , including the liedekerke municipality .
despite - or perhaps because of - its pariah status , the party has achieved considerable success in recent years by attracting protest votes .
it is the largest single party in the flemish parliament .
however a wide majority in flanders reject flemish separatism .
most people just want more autonomy within the belgian state .
" the problem with parties like vlaams belang is that they make our job a lot more difficult , " says sam custers , director of a flemish cultural centre in kraainem , another suburb of brussels .
" they create a negative image of flanders .
our message is : we 're open to everyone . "
flemish pride rarely takes a virulent form .
french-speakers visiting flanders are not in hostile territory .
the worst risk they might take is not being served until they make a token attempt to speak dutch .
but even the least nationalist among the flemish know where their main allegiance lies .
" i am flemish first , belgian second , " says pascal francois of aalst .

in april rural affairs minister elin jones announced a targeted cull and a three-year scheme has been outlined .
but she will not make a statement on the cull until early next year because she said her officials need more time to decide where it is most effective .
on bbc current affairs programme taro naw on s4c , farmers accuse her of delaying her decision unnecessarily .
many in the farming community have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine tb but animal groups say evidence does not support this .
carwyn james who farms organic cattle in cilgerran , pembrokeshire , told the programme : " the assembly government has been talking about the cull for long enough .
" the cost of the epidemic now is astronomical .
they really have to do something now . "
" i 'm certain that the epidemic is caused by moving cattle from one area to another " huw roberts , clwyd badger group " more and more badgers are being killed illegally .
farmers are losing patience and badgers are being killed in this area every week . "
between january and may 2008 , 4,600 cattle were slaughtered , compared to 3,200 in the same period in 2007 .
the cost of compensating welsh farmers for tb in cattle has risen by 59 % in the past year , up from £ 6.3m in april to september 2007 , to more than £ 10m in the same period in 2008 .
despite ms jones ' decision to increase testing of cattle , to move infected animals quickly and to set up regional tb eradication boards , farmers in wales say they are disappointed there was no decision to cull badgers in a specific area .
brian walters , deputy president of the farmers ' union of wales -lrb- fuw -rrb- , said : " if the minister does n't get this right we can forget about tackling tb in the welsh countryside .
" it will be rampant in wildlife and out of control . "
ms jones says she accepts badgers can transmit tb to cattle and that cattle can infect one another , but says her officers need more time to decide where a cull of badgers would be most effective .
" i do n't anticipate any more delays but we have to take legal and veterinary advice as to where this would be effective , " she says .
" i hope to be able to make a statement on this in the new year . "
however , conservationists say badgers are being wrongly victimised for an illness brought on by modern , intensive farming .
experiments animal campaigners have described the intended cull as " misguided " and recently held protests in bridgend , cardiff , haverfordwest , lampeter , llandysul , porthmadog , swansea , wrexham and oswestry .
huw roberts , of the clwyd badger group , said modern farming practices were responsible for spreading tb .
" scientific experiments have shown that it is cattle that are transmitting tb to badgers , " he says .
" i 'm certain that the epidemic is caused by moving cattle from one area to another . "
the uk government has decided not allow badger culling in england , warning that it could make the bovine tb problem worse .
it is a criminal offence to wilfully kill a badger under the protection of badgers act 1992 .
the offence carries a a prison sentence of up to six months .

advertisement a pembrokeshire farmer says , badgers thought to be carrying bovine tb are being killed illegally a farmer says badgers are being killed illegally amid the lack of a date for a pilot cull to tackle bovine tb .
in april rural affairs minister elin jones announced a targeted cull and a three-year scheme has been outlined .
but she will not make a statement on the cull until early next year because she said her officials need more time to decide where it is most effective .
on bbc current affairs programme taro naw on s4c , farmers accuse her of delaying her decision unnecessarily .
many in the farming community have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine tb but animal groups say evidence does not support this .
carwyn james who farms organic cattle in cilgerran , pembrokeshire , told the programme : " the assembly government has been talking about the cull for long enough .
" the cost of the epidemic now is astronomical .
they really have to do something now . "
i 'm certain that the epidemic is caused by moving cattle from one area to another huw roberts , clwyd badger group " more and more badgers are being killed illegally .
farmers are losing patience and badgers are being killed in this area every week . "
between january and may 2008 , 4,600 cattle were slaughtered , compared to 3,200 in the same period in 2007 .
the cost of compensating welsh farmers for tb in cattle has risen by 59 % in the past year , up from £ 6.3m in april to september 2007 , to more than £ 10m in the same period in 2008 .
despite ms jones ' decision to increase testing of cattle , to move infected animals quickly and to set up regional tb eradication boards , farmers in wales say they are disappointed there was no decision to cull badgers in a specific area .
brian walters , deputy president of the farmers ' union of wales -lrb- fuw -rrb- , said : " if the minister does n't get this right we can forget about tackling tb in the welsh countryside .

" it will be rampant in wildlife and out of control . "
ms jones says she accepts badgers can transmit tb to cattle and that cattle can infect one another , but says her officers need more time to decide where a cull of badgers would be most effective .
" i do n't anticipate any more delays but we have to take legal and veterinary advice as to where this would be effective , " she says .
" i hope to be able to make a statement on this in the new year . "
however , conservationists say badgers are being wrongly victimised for an illness brought on by modern , intensive farming .
experiments animal campaigners have described the intended cull as " misguided " and recently held protests in bridgend , cardiff , haverfordwest , lampeter , llandysul , porthmadog , swansea , wrexham and oswestry .
huw roberts , of the clwyd badger group , said modern farming practices were responsible for spreading tb .
" scientific experiments have shown that it is cattle that are transmitting tb to badgers , " he says .
" i 'm certain that the epidemic is caused by moving cattle from one area to another . "
the uk government has decided not allow badger culling in england , warning that it could make the bovine tb problem worse .
it is a criminal offence to wilfully kill a badger under the protection of badgers act 1992 .
the offence carries a a prison sentence of up to six months .
taro naw , made by bbc wales , is on s4c on tuesday at 2100 bst .
subtitles are available .

developer michael shanly homes wants to remove 150,000 cubic metres of landfill from badnells pit in blackamoor lane , in maidenhead .
last year , the royal borough of maidenhead and windsor council rejected plans for the homes .
michael shanly group appealed against the decision , prompting the inquiry .
' potentially harmful ' the dump was used as a unlicensed tip for industrial waste between the 1950s and 1970s .
at a public inquiry in 2006 , an inspector decided it was safe to to clear the site - despite the concerns of local residents - but work has yet to begin .
" tipping was uncontrolled and today the site is heavily contaminated with oils and solvents , while asbestos and other potentially harmful substances are present in localised areas , " a michael stanly group spokesperson said .
the developer has been trying to build homes on the site since 2004 .
