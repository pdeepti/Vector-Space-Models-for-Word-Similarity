switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .

attracted to the perks , a lot of young people are joining the ranks of mafia killers - but other youths are trying to stop them . ten plastic chairs are set up in front of an old television at the youth center in san giovanni al teduccio .
it 's movie night , and the film on the program is about raffaele cutolo , the most powerful camorra mafia boss naples has ever known . the young people are n't there for just another action movie - they want to study the camorra in order to work against it .
backed by a common motivation , they 've turned an abandoned garage into a youth center and named it after their role model peppino impastato . " he was a young man with a vision , " said 17-year-old stefano , " a young sicilian , the son of a mafioso , who broke with his family and decided to fight against the mafia . " stefano wants to follow in impastato 's footsteps .
he designs fliers denouncing the negative things that are going on in his neighborhood - and there are quite a lot , said maria and valentina , who helped found the youth center .
they live alongside the camorristi . play mirrors reality " the dirty deals happen at night , " said maria , " break-ins , drug deals , and then there are always accidents or shoot-outs - and all that practically happens outside my window . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth want to help take back their city valentina said she lives in a part of naples that " has been forgotten by the state and is dominated by crime . "
for her , it 's important to get involved at a social level and help sensitize other young people to the problems that camorra creates . with the support of father don tonino palmese and a teacher , the students at the youth center have written a play about a young thief who is shot to death in a robbery . while none of the heroes in the play have completely clean hands , the camorra members are portrayed with positive human characteristics .
that 's not necessarily politically correct , but it 's realistic , said father palmese . " the camorristi in the play are poor devils , " he said , " people who make their money dealing drugs in the winter and spring and then , after they 've spent it all on a renovated kitchen or a motorcycle , they 're left with nothing to eat . " fresh faces on both sides to be able to afford expensive status symbols , even teenagers will join the camorra .
they steal on command , commit arson , and do all the dirty work necessary to start a criminal career in naples . however , murder is still the ticket into the camorra .

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "
ireland is the only country to hold a referendum on the treaty , which it is obliged to do by its constitution .

after just four months of construction , the site will be home to the " white cube , " a modern art center designed by austrian architect adolf krischanitz . in 2010 , the white cube will be cleared away to make room for the reconstruction of the prussian " stadtschloss " palace and the extension of the city 's subway system . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said that the venue would be dedicated to exhibiting works by " artists with a connection to berlin who are on their way to worldwide renown but up until now have n't had the opportunity to be presented in berlin , " reported ap news agency . the temporary exhibition space is seen as an " appeal to create a permanent art hall in berlin , " he said , conceding that a suitable location simply had not yet been found . though the german capital is considered one of the most important centers in the world for art galleries and contemporary art production , it lacks its own exhibition hall for modern art . estimated at 950,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.49 million -rrb- , the cost of the white cube will be covered by the private foundation berlin zukunft .
the one-storey building will provide 600 square meters -lrb- 6,500 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space , and its outer surface will also be used to display art . the white cube is scheduled to open on oct .

the one-storey building will provide 600 square meters -lrb- 6,500 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space , and its outer surface will also be used to display art . the white cube is scheduled to open on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.06.2008 italian youth tackle naples mafia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : committing murder is the ticket to joining the camorra the camorra mafia group in naples is into getting rich quick without doing a lot of work .
attracted to the perks , a lot of young people are joining the ranks of mafia killers - but other youths are trying to stop them . ten plastic chairs are set up in front of an old television at the youth center in san giovanni al teduccio .
it 's movie night , and the film on the program is about raffaele cutolo , the most powerful camorra mafia boss naples has ever known . the young people are n't there for just another action movie - they want to study the camorra in order to work against it .
backed by a common motivation , they 've turned an abandoned garage into a youth center and named it after their role model peppino impastato . " he was a young man with a vision , " said 17-year-old stefano , " a young sicilian , the son of a mafioso , who broke with his family and decided to fight against the mafia . " stefano wants to follow in impastato 's footsteps .
he designs fliers denouncing the negative things that are going on in his neighborhood - and there are quite a lot , said maria and valentina , who helped found the youth center .
they live alongside the camorristi . play mirrors reality " the dirty deals happen at night , " said maria , " break-ins , drug deals , and then there are always accidents or shoot-outs - and all that practically happens outside my window . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth want to help take back their city valentina said she lives in a part of naples that " has been forgotten by the state and is dominated by crime . "
for her , it 's important to get involved at a social level and help sensitize other young people to the problems that camorra creates . with the support of father don tonino palmese and a teacher , the students at the youth center have written a play about a young thief who is shot to death in a robbery . while none of the heroes in the play have completely clean hands , the camorra members are portrayed with positive human characteristics .
that 's not necessarily politically correct , but it 's realistic , said father palmese . " the camorristi in the play are poor devils , " he said , " people who make their money dealing drugs in the winter and spring and then , after they 've spent it all on a renovated kitchen or a motorcycle , they 're left with nothing to eat . " fresh faces on both sides to be able to afford expensive status symbols , even teenagers will join the camorra .
they steal on command , commit arson , and do all the dirty work necessary to start a criminal career in naples . however , murder is still the ticket into the camorra .
and as the killers get younger and younger , fear grows in the community . marco , at 12 the youngest member of the youth center , said , " we have to overcome this fear .
otherwise we wo n't have a life anymore . " kirstin hausen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eateries , restaurants and cafes faired better . in the fourth quarter of 2007 , revenue dropped by 14.1 percent more than the previous year for bars located in states with smoking bans .
those in states without bans collected only 8.8 percent less than during the same period in 2006 . " the majority of the guests appreciate the smoking ban when they 're eating , " julius wagner from the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told ap news agency .
he added that sales suffered in particular in smaller pubs that are n't able to offer a separate smoking room . the association has said it advocates making exceptions to the ban for one-room pubs .
germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe is slated to examine the matter this coming week . industry already plagued with financial woes baden-wuerttemberg and lower saxony were the first states to introduce smoking bans in august 2007 , with hesse following in october . sales in beverage-oriented pubs and bars in states with smoking bans dropped by 9.8 in the third quarter of 2007 , 3 percent more than in the rest of the country . an additional nine states implemented smoking bans at the beginning of 2008 .
though a first-quarter loss of 4.6 percent was registered for pubs and bars in the 14 states with bans , the statistical office said a comparison with the other two states was not possible . restaurants and eateries in states with smoking bans recorded a 0.8 loss compared to the first quarter last year . dehoga has said that gastronomic revenues have already been slipping over the past several years , due to a 2007 increase in value-added tax , higher beer prices and soaring energy costs . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he designs fliers denouncing the negative things that are going on in his neighborhood - and there are quite a lot , said maria and valentina , who helped found the youth center .
they live alongside the camorristi . play mirrors reality " the dirty deals happen at night , " said maria , " break-ins , drug deals , and then there are always accidents or shoot-outs - and all that practically happens outside my window . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth want to help take back their city valentina said she lives in a part of naples that " has been forgotten by the state and is dominated by crime . "
for her , it 's important to get involved at a social level and help sensitize other young people to the problems that camorra creates . with the support of father don tonino palmese and a teacher , the students at the youth center have written a play about a young thief who is shot to death in a robbery . while none of the heroes in the play have completely clean hands , the camorra members are portrayed with positive human characteristics .
that 's not necessarily politically correct , but it 's realistic , said father palmese . " the camorristi in the play are poor devils , " he said , " people who make their money dealing drugs in the winter and spring and then , after they 've spent it all on a renovated kitchen or a motorcycle , they 're left with nothing to eat . " fresh faces on both sides to be able to afford expensive status symbols , even teenagers will join the camorra .
they steal on command , commit arson , and do all the dirty work necessary to start a criminal career in naples . however , murder is still the ticket into the camorra .
and as the killers get younger and younger , fear grows in the community . marco , at 12 the youngest member of the youth center , said , " we have to overcome this fear .
otherwise we wo n't have a life anymore . " kirstin hausen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eateries , restaurants and cafes faired better . in the fourth quarter of 2007 , revenue dropped by 14.1 percent more than the previous year for bars located in states with smoking bans .
those in states without bans collected only 8.8 percent less than during the same period in 2006 . " the majority of the guests appreciate the smoking ban when they 're eating , " julius wagner from the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told ap news agency .
he added that sales suffered in particular in smaller pubs that are n't able to offer a separate smoking room . the association has said it advocates making exceptions to the ban for one-room pubs .
germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe is slated to examine the matter this coming week . industry already plagued with financial woes baden-wuerttemberg and lower saxony were the first states to introduce smoking bans in august 2007 , with hesse following in october . sales in beverage-oriented pubs and bars in states with smoking bans dropped by 9.8 in the third quarter of 2007 , 3 percent more than in the rest of the country . an additional nine states implemented smoking bans at the beginning of 2008 .
though a first-quarter loss of 4.6 percent was registered for pubs and bars in the 14 states with bans , the statistical office said a comparison with the other two states was not possible . restaurants and eateries in states with smoking bans recorded a 0.8 loss compared to the first quarter last year . dehoga has said that gastronomic revenues have already been slipping over the past several years , due to a 2007 increase in value-added tax , higher beer prices and soaring energy costs . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 07.06.2008 berlin gets new art exhibition center großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's artists will finally have a local venue after a long wait , the german capital will finally get its own art exhibition hall - but only for two years .
after that , it 'll have to pull out .
but until then , top berlin artists will have a place to show their work . a ground-breaking ceremony was held at the schlossplatz in downtown berlin on friday , june 6 .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .

the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eateries , restaurants and cafes faired better . in the fourth quarter of 2007 , revenue dropped by 14.1 percent more than the previous year for bars located in states with smoking bans .
those in states without bans collected only 8.8 percent less than during the same period in 2006 . " the majority of the guests appreciate the smoking ban when they 're eating , " julius wagner from the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told ap news agency .
he added that sales suffered in particular in smaller pubs that are n't able to offer a separate smoking room . the association has said it advocates making exceptions to the ban for one-room pubs .
germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe is slated to examine the matter this coming week . industry already plagued with financial woes baden-wuerttemberg and lower saxony were the first states to introduce smoking bans in august 2007 , with hesse following in october . sales in beverage-oriented pubs and bars in states with smoking bans dropped by 9.8 in the third quarter of 2007 , 3 percent more than in the rest of the country . an additional nine states implemented smoking bans at the beginning of 2008 .
though a first-quarter loss of 4.6 percent was registered for pubs and bars in the 14 states with bans , the statistical office said a comparison with the other two states was not possible . restaurants and eateries in states with smoking bans recorded a 0.8 loss compared to the first quarter last year . dehoga has said that gastronomic revenues have already been slipping over the past several years , due to a 2007 increase in value-added tax , higher beer prices and soaring energy costs . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .

all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.06.2008 italian youth tackle naples mafia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : committing murder is the ticket to joining the camorra the camorra mafia group in naples is into getting rich quick without doing a lot of work .
attracted to the perks , a lot of young people are joining the ranks of mafia killers - but other youths are trying to stop them . ten plastic chairs are set up in front of an old television at the youth center in san giovanni al teduccio .
it 's movie night , and the film on the program is about raffaele cutolo , the most powerful camorra mafia boss naples has ever known . the young people are n't there for just another action movie - they want to study the camorra in order to work against it .
backed by a common motivation , they 've turned an abandoned garage into a youth center and named it after their role model peppino impastato . " he was a young man with a vision , " said 17-year-old stefano , " a young sicilian , the son of a mafioso , who broke with his family and decided to fight against the mafia . " stefano wants to follow in impastato 's footsteps .
he designs fliers denouncing the negative things that are going on in his neighborhood - and there are quite a lot , said maria and valentina , who helped found the youth center .
they live alongside the camorristi . play mirrors reality " the dirty deals happen at night , " said maria , " break-ins , drug deals , and then there are always accidents or shoot-outs - and all that practically happens outside my window . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth want to help take back their city valentina said she lives in a part of naples that " has been forgotten by the state and is dominated by crime . "
for her , it 's important to get involved at a social level and help sensitize other young people to the problems that camorra creates . with the support of father don tonino palmese and a teacher , the students at the youth center have written a play about a young thief who is shot to death in a robbery . while none of the heroes in the play have completely clean hands , the camorra members are portrayed with positive human characteristics .
that 's not necessarily politically correct , but it 's realistic , said father palmese . " the camorristi in the play are poor devils , " he said , " people who make their money dealing drugs in the winter and spring and then , after they 've spent it all on a renovated kitchen or a motorcycle , they 're left with nothing to eat . " fresh faces on both sides to be able to afford expensive status symbols , even teenagers will join the camorra .
they steal on command , commit arson , and do all the dirty work necessary to start a criminal career in naples . however , murder is still the ticket into the camorra .
and as the killers get younger and younger , fear grows in the community . marco , at 12 the youngest member of the youth center , said , " we have to overcome this fear .
otherwise we wo n't have a life anymore . " kirstin hausen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attracted to the perks , a lot of young people are joining the ranks of mafia killers - but other youths are trying to stop them . ten plastic chairs are set up in front of an old television at the youth center in san giovanni al teduccio .
it 's movie night , and the film on the program is about raffaele cutolo , the most powerful camorra mafia boss naples has ever known . the young people are n't there for just another action movie - they want to study the camorra in order to work against it .
backed by a common motivation , they 've turned an abandoned garage into a youth center and named it after their role model peppino impastato . " he was a young man with a vision , " said 17-year-old stefano , " a young sicilian , the son of a mafioso , who broke with his family and decided to fight against the mafia . " stefano wants to follow in impastato 's footsteps .
he designs fliers denouncing the negative things that are going on in his neighborhood - and there are quite a lot , said maria and valentina , who helped found the youth center .
they live alongside the camorristi . play mirrors reality " the dirty deals happen at night , " said maria , " break-ins , drug deals , and then there are always accidents or shoot-outs - and all that practically happens outside my window . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth want to help take back their city valentina said she lives in a part of naples that " has been forgotten by the state and is dominated by crime . "
for her , it 's important to get involved at a social level and help sensitize other young people to the problems that camorra creates . with the support of father don tonino palmese and a teacher , the students at the youth center have written a play about a young thief who is shot to death in a robbery . while none of the heroes in the play have completely clean hands , the camorra members are portrayed with positive human characteristics .
that 's not necessarily politically correct , but it 's realistic , said father palmese . " the camorristi in the play are poor devils , " he said , " people who make their money dealing drugs in the winter and spring and then , after they 've spent it all on a renovated kitchen or a motorcycle , they 're left with nothing to eat . " fresh faces on both sides to be able to afford expensive status symbols , even teenagers will join the camorra .
they steal on command , commit arson , and do all the dirty work necessary to start a criminal career in naples . however , murder is still the ticket into the camorra .
and as the killers get younger and younger , fear grows in the community . marco , at 12 the youngest member of the youth center , said , " we have to overcome this fear .
otherwise we wo n't have a life anymore . " kirstin hausen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after just four months of construction , the site will be home to the " white cube , " a modern art center designed by austrian architect adolf krischanitz . in 2010 , the white cube will be cleared away to make room for the reconstruction of the prussian " stadtschloss " palace and the extension of the city 's subway system . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said that the venue would be dedicated to exhibiting works by " artists with a connection to berlin who are on their way to worldwide renown but up until now have n't had the opportunity to be presented in berlin , " reported ap news agency . the temporary exhibition space is seen as an " appeal to create a permanent art hall in berlin , " he said , conceding that a suitable location simply had not yet been found . though the german capital is considered one of the most important centers in the world for art galleries and contemporary art production , it lacks its own exhibition hall for modern art . estimated at 950,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.49 million -rrb- , the cost of the white cube will be covered by the private foundation berlin zukunft .
the one-storey building will provide 600 square meters -lrb- 6,500 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space , and its outer surface will also be used to display art . the white cube is scheduled to open on oct .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .

the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .

attracted to the perks , a lot of young people are joining the ranks of mafia killers - but other youths are trying to stop them . ten plastic chairs are set up in front of an old television at the youth center in san giovanni al teduccio .
it 's movie night , and the film on the program is about raffaele cutolo , the most powerful camorra mafia boss naples has ever known . the young people are n't there for just another action movie - they want to study the camorra in order to work against it .
backed by a common motivation , they 've turned an abandoned garage into a youth center and named it after their role model peppino impastato . " he was a young man with a vision , " said 17-year-old stefano , " a young sicilian , the son of a mafioso , who broke with his family and decided to fight against the mafia . " stefano wants to follow in impastato 's footsteps .
he designs fliers denouncing the negative things that are going on in his neighborhood - and there are quite a lot , said maria and valentina , who helped found the youth center .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth want to help take back their city valentina said she lives in a part of naples that " has been forgotten by the state and is dominated by crime . "
for her , it 's important to get involved at a social level and help sensitize other young people to the problems that camorra creates . with the support of father don tonino palmese and a teacher , the students at the youth center have written a play about a young thief who is shot to death in a robbery . while none of the heroes in the play have completely clean hands , the camorra members are portrayed with positive human characteristics .
that 's not necessarily politically correct , but it 's realistic , said father palmese . " the camorristi in the play are poor devils , " he said , " people who make their money dealing drugs in the winter and spring and then , after they 've spent it all on a renovated kitchen or a motorcycle , they 're left with nothing to eat . " fresh faces on both sides to be able to afford expensive status symbols , even teenagers will join the camorra .
they steal on command , commit arson , and do all the dirty work necessary to start a criminal career in naples . however , murder is still the ticket into the camorra .
and as the killers get younger and younger , fear grows in the community . marco , at 12 the youngest member of the youth center , said , " we have to overcome this fear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.06.2008 ireland 's mixed signals on lisbon treaty vote cause concern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty was supposed to unite the eu - some irish have other ideas the " no " side has surged ahead a week before ireland holds a referendum on the european union 's lisbon treaty as the irish justice minister warned there is " no plan b " if irish voters reject the referendum . the tns / mrbi survey of 1,000 voters carried by the irish times showed opponents of the treaty 5 per cent ahead of those in favor .
all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "
ireland is the only country to hold a referendum on the treaty , which it is obliged to do by its constitution .
other eu member states opted for a parliamentary vote , and 15 have already ratified the text . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "
ireland is the only country to hold a referendum on the treaty , which it is obliged to do by its constitution .
other eu member states opted for a parliamentary vote , and 15 have already ratified the text . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.06.2008 ireland 's mixed signals on lisbon treaty vote cause concern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty was supposed to unite the eu - some irish have other ideas the " no " side has surged ahead a week before ireland holds a referendum on the european union 's lisbon treaty as the irish justice minister warned there is " no plan b " if irish voters reject the referendum . the tns / mrbi survey of 1,000 voters carried by the irish times showed opponents of the treaty 5 per cent ahead of those in favor .
all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "
ireland is the only country to hold a referendum on the treaty , which it is obliged to do by its constitution .
other eu member states opted for a parliamentary vote , and 15 have already ratified the text . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week a rome appeal court upheld damages claims from italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis in a ruling that could put german government assets in italy at risk of being seized and sold .
german government spokesmen said they did not believe this was legally possible and added that berlin was keeping its legal options open .
speaking for the foundation , manfred gentz said : " there is no more money . "
the soldiers did not qualify for payments to the foundation , which up until last year was still making payments to former forced laborers .
the foundation was set up by the german government in 2000 with 10 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 5 billion euros - $ 7.85 billion -rrb- , funded half by the state and half by german business .
billions were paid out to holocaust survivors , former slave laborers and labor conscripts , including italian civilians , but not to 600,000 italian soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin says they were prisoners of war and there is no basis for the claim .
the foundation paid out 1.9 million euros -lrb- 2.9 million dollars -rrb- to 3,395 italians who were forced as civilians to work in nazi germany .
italian news reports say the ex-soldiers may claim as much as 60 million euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .
switzerland battled to the end but a bitterly frustrating evening was to be summed up when vonlanthen 's follow-up crashed against the woodwork after cech had parried tranquillo barnetta 's low shot from the edge of the area . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "
ireland is the only country to hold a referendum on the treaty , which it is obliged to do by its constitution .
other eu member states opted for a parliamentary vote , and 15 have already ratified the text . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.06.2008 ireland 's mixed signals on lisbon treaty vote cause concern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty was supposed to unite the eu - some irish have other ideas the " no " side has surged ahead a week before ireland holds a referendum on the european union 's lisbon treaty as the irish justice minister warned there is " no plan b " if irish voters reject the referendum . the tns / mrbi survey of 1,000 voters carried by the irish times showed opponents of the treaty 5 per cent ahead of those in favor .
all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .

switzerland enjoyed the majority of possession but fell behind against the run of play when sverkos , who replaced the ineffective jan koller , remained onside as the swiss defense pushed out after a corner and calmly slotted the ball home .
it was a fine piece of finishing but a painfully cruel blow for a swiss side that was repeatedly frustrated by their opponents ' outstanding goalkeeper , petr cech , and the hosts were denied an equalizer when substitute johan venlanthen 's shot came back off the post .
the fact that jakob kuhn 's squad had not played a competitive match in nearly two years was belied by a high-tempo start which might have yielded a goal after barely two minutes , when frei 's shot slid narrowly wide of cech 's right-hand post with the goalkeeper struggling to cover .
swiss enjoy lion 's share of possession and chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss gave a good account of themselves that set the tone for a first-half in which a combination of energetic pressing by the swiss and the penetration of lazio 's valon behrami down the right flank restricted the czechs to a handful of counter-attacks , their only moment of menace coming from david jarolim 's deflected cross which almost caught out benaglio in the 13th minute .
the co-hosts , in contrast , might easily have been ahead by the break but for the habitual efficiency of cech .
having blocked goalbound shots from behrami and gokhan inler , the chelsea goalkeeper came swiftly off his line to deny frei at close range after the swiss captain had been allowed to run on to benaglio 's box-to-box punt .
frei was to provide one more demonstration of why he has plundered 35 goals in 60 appearances for his country - a swerving drive from 30 yards that cech could only beat away - before tragedy struck three minutes from the break .
frei 's injury silences boisterous crowd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frei 's injury was not as bad as first thought - but bad enough as he contested a 50-50 ball with czech right-back zdenek grygera , the swiss captain 's left knee appeared to lock against his opponent 's leg and he slumped to the turf in agony .
minutes later he was limping from the pitch in tears , the hush that had descended on the st-jakob park stadium telling its own story about the implications for the co-hosts for the rest of the tournament .
the inevitable substitution was delayed until after the interval , when frei 's replacement , the veteran hakan yakin , had an immediate impact , drawing tomas galasek into a trip on the edge of the area and then curling the resulting free-kick inches over .
nearly an hour had elapsed before the czechs finally generated their first clear chance , libor sionko glancing marek jankulovski 's free-kick wide after the inswinging delivery had found him unmarked six yards out .
co-hosts continue to press but to no effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland fought hard but without reward switzerland responded by carving out an equally gilt-edged opportunity of their own , hakan planting his header wide from eight yards after a fine cross from overlapping right-back stephan lichsteiner .
the cost of that miss was to become apparent minutes later when sverkos , a second-half substitute for the ineffective jan koller , fired the czechs into the lead .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .

all polls up until now had shown the yes side in the lead .
the no side now stands at 35 per cent , up 17 per cent since three weeks ago , while the yes side has lost five points to 30 per cent .
some 35 per cent of voters still have n't made up their minds .
justice minister brian lenihan told irish radio friday that a no vote would be " bad for ireland , bad for jobs and bad for goodwill " towards ireland in europe .
he said rejection of the treaty would send the " wrong signal " to ireland 's largest market .
taoiseach -lrb- prime minister -rrb- brian cowen said he was confident the yes vote would increase and he accused the no campaign of creating fear , suspicion and confusion .
government paints a rosy picture bildunterschrift : cowen is optimistic of a yes vote in the government 's own survey , seven out of 10 households said they were in favor of the treaty , roche said in an interview with the french daily le figaro , contradicting a poll published by the irish times on friday in which a no vote seemed likely in the june 12 referendum .
roche hinted however that abstention by voters could harm the prospects for the lisbon treaty saying the most difficult task now would be to convince people to turn out to vote .
in the comments quoted in french in le figaro newspaper , he warned a rejection of the treaty would be a major " defeat for ireland and europe , " undermining its ability to tackle challenges such as globalization and crime .
according to the irish times survey , 35 percent of people planned to vote against the treaty , while 30 percent said they would vote in favor .
some 28 percent were undecided , while seven percent said they will not take part .
ireland votes on the treaty on june 12 , the only one of 27 eu member states to hold a public referendum on the treaty aimed at simplifying decision-making in the bloc .
an irish no would mean the treaty , a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters , could not go into effect .
treaty rests on notoriously headstrong irish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nizza treaty got similarly short thrift irish voters have caused headaches for the eu in the past , rejecting the nice treaty in 2001 before approving it in a second referendum a year later .
all the major irish political parties have been campaigning for a yes vote .
the nationalist party , sinn fein , is the only party with parliamentary representation which opposes the treaty .
it has four seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
sinn fein mep mary lou mcdonald said the opinion poll showed that the irish public believes a better deal is possible .
declan ganley , the founder of the main anti-treaty group , libertas , said the referendum could still be won by either side .
a spokesman for the european commission refused to comment on the survey : " opinion polls are not decisive .
the decisive thing will be when the irish people go to the polls .
and we wo n't speculate on what the decision will be . "
ireland is the only country to hold a referendum on the treaty , which it is obliged to do by its constitution .
other eu member states opted for a parliamentary vote , and 15 have already ratified the text . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russia could help . medvedev said at the st. petersburg international economic forum on saturday , june 7 , that the gap between the us ' leading role in the global economic system and its abilities was one of the " key reasons " for the predicament . the world lacks investment assets due to disappointment with the ailing us dollar , he said . medvedev added that russia could play a role in stabilizing the situation .
the country 's domestic economy has boomed over the past decade under his predecessor vladimir putin , largely due to soaring prices for its oil exports .
russia is the world 's largest producer of gas and second largest exporter of oil . " russia is now a global player and understands its responsibility for the fate of the world , " said medvedev , who took office on may 7 .

his country would be ready to host an international finance conference as early as this year , said medvedev . seen as an economic liberal , medvedev has in the past month launched a number of initiatives to boost the rule of law , fight corruption and ease conditions for small businesses in russia . saturday 's speech , his first major economic address , was closely watched for signs of russia 's future economic strategy . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after just four months of construction , the site will be home to the " white cube , " a modern art center designed by austrian architect adolf krischanitz . in 2010 , the white cube will be cleared away to make room for the reconstruction of the prussian " stadtschloss " palace and the extension of the city 's subway system . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said that the venue would be dedicated to exhibiting works by " artists with a connection to berlin who are on their way to worldwide renown but up until now have n't had the opportunity to be presented in berlin , " reported ap news agency . the temporary exhibition space is seen as an " appeal to create a permanent art hall in berlin , " he said , conceding that a suitable location simply had not yet been found . though the german capital is considered one of the most important centers in the world for art galleries and contemporary art production , it lacks its own exhibition hall for modern art . estimated at 950,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.49 million -rrb- , the cost of the white cube will be covered by the private foundation berlin zukunft .
the one-storey building will provide 600 square meters -lrb- 6,500 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space , and its outer surface will also be used to display art . the white cube is scheduled to open on oct .

eateries , restaurants and cafes faired better . in the fourth quarter of 2007 , revenue dropped by 14.1 percent more than the previous year for bars located in states with smoking bans .
those in states without bans collected only 8.8 percent less than during the same period in 2006 . " the majority of the guests appreciate the smoking ban when they 're eating , " julius wagner from the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told ap news agency .
he added that sales suffered in particular in smaller pubs that are n't able to offer a separate smoking room . the association has said it advocates making exceptions to the ban for one-room pubs .
germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe is slated to examine the matter this coming week . industry already plagued with financial woes baden-wuerttemberg and lower saxony were the first states to introduce smoking bans in august 2007 , with hesse following in october . sales in beverage-oriented pubs and bars in states with smoking bans dropped by 9.8 in the third quarter of 2007 , 3 percent more than in the rest of the country . an additional nine states implemented smoking bans at the beginning of 2008 .
though a first-quarter loss of 4.6 percent was registered for pubs and bars in the 14 states with bans , the statistical office said a comparison with the other two states was not possible . restaurants and eateries in states with smoking bans recorded a 0.8 loss compared to the first quarter last year . dehoga has said that gastronomic revenues have already been slipping over the past several years , due to a 2007 increase in value-added tax , higher beer prices and soaring energy costs . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some of the reasons for bulgaria 's plight can be found in the capital sofia 's leafy central cemetery .
under black marble monuments engraved with life-size portraits lie men whom most bulgarians know by their nicknames : the godfather , the doctor , the russian , the banker ...
it is a who 's who of those who became mega-rich during the country 's murky transition to democracy and died in a hail of bullets .
shady connections there have been 150 contract killings since 1990 , but not a single conviction .
the latest took place in april , not far from one of the busiest bus stops in sofia . "
the politicians should be getting to work too , rather than blaming us for their problems " plamen galev and angel hristov best-selling author georgi stoev was shot three times , once in the head , and died later that day in hospital .
a former wrestler , mr stoev had written nine books about bulgaria 's mafia bosses , many of whom he claimed to know personally .
some say he was killed by his characters .
but his editor vlado daverov holds little hope of solving the whodunit .
" it would be a first in bulgaria , " he said .
many suspect that crimes remain unpunished due to links between the former communist security services , business and politics .
the interior ministry was recently rocked by revelations that senior officials had been leaking files to mafia suspects .
the interior minister himself had to resign after admitting he had met two controversial businessmen , plamen galev and angel hristov , who were under investigation at the time .
the speculation in the local media is that the minister asked them to stop shooting members of a rival clan in the run-up to bulgaria 's eu accession .
under scrutiny i drove to dupnitsa , a town not far from the capital , to hear their side of the story .
as former members of the anti-terrorist unit , mr galev and mr hristov look more like boxers than your average businessmen .
but they drive to work in a black armoured jeep , which cost $ 400,000 , and their office is in dupnitsa city hall .
as special advisors to the local mayor , they insist their reputation is unassailable .
" if we were guilty in the slightest , " mr galev told me , " do you think we 'd be sitting here talking to you ?
" the authorities have checked our properties , the source of our income , they 've checked us for drugs .
the only thing they did n't accuse us of is being cousins to bin laden ! "
as for the meeting with the former interior minister , it was for reasons of national security which they could not disclose .
they even drove me around dupnitsa in the armoured jeep on a tour of their projects - leisure facilities in the local park , a new school canteen , a revamped bus terminal .
" the politicians , " they said , " should be getting to work too , rather than blaming us for their problems . "
under growing pressure from the eu , the bulgarian authorities have sprung into action .
there is a new agency to crack down on organised crime and new ministers have been appointed to ensure eu money does not fall into the wrong hands .
along with its neighbour romania , bulgaria is subject to special monitoring because neither country was deemed to fully comply with eu standards when they joined the bloc in 2007 .
a team of eu officials was in sofia this week to assess progress ahead of a key report in july .
while prime minister sergei stanishev admits there are problems , he denies that cutting aid is the answer .
" if bulgaria would be punished , " he told me , " who would suffer ?
bulgarians have always been very pro-european and they would expect indeed that they would not be deprived of the possibility to enjoy the membership of the eu , to benefit from it . "
the eu has already frozen hundreds of millions in aid for bulgaria 's battered roads and other desperately needed development projects .
but there are billions more to come in the next years .
and as one eu official who visited bulgaria this week told me , cutting aid is clearly an option .

some of the reasons for bulgaria 's plight can be found in the capital sofia 's leafy central cemetery .

it is a who 's who of those who became mega-rich during the country 's murky transition to democracy and died in a hail of bullets .
shady connections there have been 150 contract killings since 1990 , but not a single conviction .
the latest took place in april , not far from one of the busiest bus stops in sofia .
the politicians should be getting to work too , rather than blaming us for their problems plamen galev and angel hristov best-selling author georgi stoev was shot three times , once in the head , and died later that day in hospital .
a former wrestler , mr stoev had written nine books about bulgaria 's mafia bosses , many of whom he claimed to know personally .
some say he was killed by his characters .
but his editor vlado daverov holds little hope of solving the whodunit .
" it would be a first in bulgaria , " he said .
many suspect that crimes remain unpunished due to links between the former communist security services , business and politics .
the interior ministry was recently rocked by revelations that senior officials had been leaking files to mafia suspects .
the interior minister himself had to resign after admitting he had met two controversial businessmen , plamen galev and angel hristov , who were under investigation at the time .
the speculation in the local media is that the minister asked them to stop shooting members of a rival clan in the run-up to bulgaria 's eu accession .
under scrutiny i drove to dupnitsa , a town not far from the capital , to hear their side of the story .
mr stanishev recently carried out a major cabinet reshuffle as former members of the anti-terrorist unit , mr galev and mr hristov look more like boxers than your average businessmen .
but they drive to work in a black armoured jeep , which cost $ 400,000 , and their office is in dupnitsa city hall .
as special advisors to the local mayor , they insist their reputation is unassailable .
" if we were guilty in the slightest , " mr galev told me , " do you think we 'd be sitting here talking to you ?
" the authorities have checked our properties , the source of our income , they 've checked us for drugs .
the only thing they did n't accuse us of is being cousins to bin laden ! "
as for the meeting with the former interior minister , it was for reasons of national security which they could not disclose .
they even drove me around dupnitsa in the armoured jeep on a tour of their projects - leisure facilities in the local park , a new school canteen , a revamped bus terminal .
" the politicians , " they said , " should be getting to work too , rather than blaming us for their problems . "
under growing pressure from the eu , the bulgarian authorities have sprung into action .
there is a new agency to crack down on organised crime and new ministers have been appointed to ensure eu money does not fall into the wrong hands .
along with its neighbour romania , bulgaria is subject to special monitoring because neither country was deemed to fully comply with eu standards when they joined the bloc in 2007 .
a team of eu officials was in sofia this week to assess progress ahead of a key report in july .
while prime minister sergei stanishev admits there are problems , he denies that cutting aid is the answer .
" if bulgaria would be punished , " he told me , " who would suffer ?
bulgarians have always been very pro-european and they would expect indeed that they would not be deprived of the possibility to enjoy the membership of the eu , to benefit from it . "
the eu has already frozen hundreds of millions in aid for bulgaria 's battered roads and other desperately needed development projects .
but there are billions more to come in the next years .
and as one eu official who visited bulgaria this week told me , cutting aid is clearly an option .

" if bulgaria would be punished , " he told me , " who would suffer ?
bulgarians have always been very pro-european and they would expect indeed that they would not be deprived of the possibility to enjoy the membership of the eu , to benefit from it . "
the eu has already frozen hundreds of millions in aid for bulgaria 's battered roads and other desperately needed development projects .

and as one eu official who visited bulgaria this week told me , cutting aid is clearly an option .

some of the reasons for bulgaria 's plight can be found in the capital sofia 's leafy central cemetery .
under black marble monuments engraved with life-size portraits lie men whom most bulgarians know by their nicknames : the godfather , the doctor , the russian , the banker ...
it is a who 's who of those who became mega-rich during the country 's murky transition to democracy and died in a hail of bullets .
shady connections there have been 150 contract killings since 1990 , but not a single conviction .
the latest took place in april , not far from one of the busiest bus stops in sofia .
the politicians should be getting to work too , rather than blaming us for their problems plamen galev and angel hristov best-selling author georgi stoev was shot three times , once in the head , and died later that day in hospital .
a former wrestler , mr stoev had written nine books about bulgaria 's mafia bosses , many of whom he claimed to know personally .
some say he was killed by his characters .
but his editor vlado daverov holds little hope of solving the whodunit .
" it would be a first in bulgaria , " he said .
many suspect that crimes remain unpunished due to links between the former communist security services , business and politics .
the interior ministry was recently rocked by revelations that senior officials had been leaking files to mafia suspects .
the interior minister himself had to resign after admitting he had met two controversial businessmen , plamen galev and angel hristov , who were under investigation at the time .
the speculation in the local media is that the minister asked them to stop shooting members of a rival clan in the run-up to bulgaria 's eu accession .
under scrutiny i drove to dupnitsa , a town not far from the capital , to hear their side of the story .
mr stanishev recently carried out a major cabinet reshuffle as former members of the anti-terrorist unit , mr galev and mr hristov look more like boxers than your average businessmen .
but they drive to work in a black armoured jeep , which cost $ 400,000 , and their office is in dupnitsa city hall .
as special advisors to the local mayor , they insist their reputation is unassailable .
" if we were guilty in the slightest , " mr galev told me , " do you think we 'd be sitting here talking to you ?
" the authorities have checked our properties , the source of our income , they 've checked us for drugs .
the only thing they did n't accuse us of is being cousins to bin laden ! "
as for the meeting with the former interior minister , it was for reasons of national security which they could not disclose .
they even drove me around dupnitsa in the armoured jeep on a tour of their projects - leisure facilities in the local park , a new school canteen , a revamped bus terminal .
" the politicians , " they said , " should be getting to work too , rather than blaming us for their problems . "
under growing pressure from the eu , the bulgarian authorities have sprung into action .
there is a new agency to crack down on organised crime and new ministers have been appointed to ensure eu money does not fall into the wrong hands .
along with its neighbour romania , bulgaria is subject to special monitoring because neither country was deemed to fully comply with eu standards when they joined the bloc in 2007 .

brad taylor is known as the spam tsar , a title he quite enjoys .
he has been working on gmail since its public launch in 2004 and says he has seen a real growth in the amount of unsolicited e-mail flooding into the system .
" originally when we launched 25 % of e-mail was spam .
we caught a lot of that .
over time it 's grown and grown and currently around 75 % of all e-mail is spam and so our job has got a lot harder . "
top secret in the heart of this open space is the so-called " war room " .
here half a dozen engineers are huddled into a cramped office to work on top secret projects .

todd jackson , another gmail product manager , was more serious when he said that the engineers did n't leave until they had either solved a particular problem or fully developed a new feature .
situated next to the office cafe is the usability lab , where gmail invites small groups of six to eight people to test new applications to see how they will fare with the general public .
nika smith , who helps run the lab , says instead of having a two-way mirror to watch participants and how they interact with a product , they are a little more high-tech .
" we have this little hidden camera next to some flowers and one in the corner of the room .
we just want to know how they use gmail and see from the users ' perspective what their experience is like .

decked out with a slew of monitors and computers , there is also a selection of drinks , a drum kit and a couple of guitars .
on the wall hangs a whiteboard with a wish-list of things like " surround sound , a wii fit machine and a bigger tv " .
the overall lab space is like any other nondescript office , albeit with a few fun quirks here and there such as naming every printer and copier after tv shows like the a-team and all in the family .
but sometimes things do get serious , and everyone is on a pager and gets an alert when something goes amiss with the site .

the most popular features will become part of the gmail product the new developments , which are only available in the uk and the us , show up as a red tab at the top of the page .
gmail product manager keith coleman says : " this marks a big change in the way the company does product development . "

every idea is treated as having value normally such spaces are off-limits to people outside the company .
as well as being shown the new service ahead of release , we were also walked through the offices where engineers take 20 % of their time to come up with ideas and work on them .
the 20 % time is part of google 's core ethos .

brad taylor is known as the spam tsar , a title he quite enjoys .
he has been working on gmail since its public launch in 2004 and says he has seen a real growth in the amount of unsolicited e-mail flooding into the system .
" originally when we launched 25 % of e-mail was spam .
we caught a lot of that .
over time it 's grown and grown and currently around 75 % of all e-mail is spam and so our job has got a lot harder . "
top secret in the heart of this open space is the so-called " war room " .
here half a dozen engineers are huddled into a cramped office to work on top secret projects .
everyone there was tight-lipped about what the next big thing coming out of the room would be but helpfully quipped that it was a new colour .
dreaming up the future of gmail todd jackson , another gmail product manager , was more serious when he said that the engineers did n't leave until they had either solved a particular problem or fully developed a new feature .
situated next to the office cafe is the usability lab , where gmail invites small groups of six to eight people to test new applications to see how they will fare with the general public .
nika smith , who helps run the lab , says instead of having a two-way mirror to watch participants and how they interact with a product , they are a little more high-tech .
" we have this little hidden camera next to some flowers and one in the corner of the room .
we just want to know how they use gmail and see from the users ' perspective what their experience is like .
" then we just watch how they interact with the product and work out what improvements are needed . "
a-team perhaps one of the coolest areas in the gmail lab is the site reliability room , which is just past a sign that says " hippies use backdoor " .
decked out with a slew of monitors and computers , there is also a selection of drinks , a drum kit and a couple of guitars .
on the wall hangs a whiteboard with a wish-list of things like " surround sound , a wii fit machine and a bigger tv " .
the overall lab space is like any other nondescript office , albeit with a few fun quirks here and there such as naming every printer and copier after tv shows like the a-team and all in the family .
but sometimes things do get serious , and everyone is on a pager and gets an alert when something goes amiss with the site .
